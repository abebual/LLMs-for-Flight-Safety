# LLMs-for-Flight-Safety
***

The project aims to enhance the handling of Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Title 14, Part 33, related to aircraft engine airworthiness standards by employing Deep Learning Models. It involves two main approaches: first, fine-tuning a foundational Large Language Model (LLM) to perform question/answer tasks on flightworthiness directive text, enabling task-specific understanding and text generation. Second, the project will implement Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) methods to seamlessly integrate external knowledge sources into generated content, enhancing its relevance and quality. The key objectives include systematically comparing the performance of the fine-tuned LLM with RAG techniques and establishing an evaluation framework with defined metrics for assessing the generated content's quality, relevance, and efficiency. The project's approach encompasses model selection, data collection, preprocessing, fine-tuning, retrieval mechanism development, and optimization of both approaches
