# LLMs-for-Flight-Safety
***
## Project
The project focuses on leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline the handling of Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) flightworthiness directives. LLMs offer automation of manual processes involved in interpreting these directives, ensuring timely and accurate compliance. The study uses a dataset from Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) Title 14, Part 33, which pertains to aircraft engine airworthiness standards. The project explores the advantages and disadvantages of fine-tuning LLMs versus Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) methods and aims to systematically compare their performance for question/answer tasks. The objectives include fine-tuning a foundational LLM, implementing RAG techniques, establishing an evaluation framework, and optimizing both approaches. The expected outcomes comprise fine-tuned LLM models, a functional retrieval augmentation generation system, a comprehensive comparison report, evaluation metrics, and potentially a user interface for practical use.
