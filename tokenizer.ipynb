        "OpenAI's GPT-2/3 model uses a specific type of tokenizer known as a \"byte pair encoding\" (BPE) tokenizer. BPE is a subword tokenization method that breaks down text into subword units, such as characters or character sequences, and assigns a unique token to each subword unit. BPE is capable of handling a wide range of languages and can handle out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them down into subword units.\n",

        "OpenAI's GPT-3 model uses a variant of BPE known as \"GPT-2-style BPE,\" which means it uses BPE tokenization with a specific vocabulary and token encoding scheme.\n",
        "\n",
        "When working with OpenAI's pre-trained models, it's important to use the same tokenizer that was used during their pre-training, which is the GPT-2-style BPE tokenizer. OpenAI typically provides the pre-trained models along with their corresponding tokenizers, which are often available as part of the model package or through OpenAI's API."

This can be accomplished by increasing test speed, temperature, and/or loads. \\n(2) When an engine test is being used \\nto demonstrate compliance with the overspeed conditions listed in para-graph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section and the failure of a component or system is sudden and transient, it may not be possible to operate the engine for 5 minutes after the failure.

The tool must be validated for each material. The rotor being cer-tified must not exceed the boundaries of the rotors being used to validate the analytical tool in terms of geometric shape, operating stress, and tempera-ture.

In dealing with probabilities of this low order of mag-nitude, absolute proof is not possible, and compliance may be shown by reli-ance on engineering judgment and pre-vious experience combined with sound design and test philosophies. \\n(4) The applicant must show that \\nmajor engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that de-fined as remote (probability range of 10\\n¥5to 10¥7per engine flight hour). \\n(b) The FAA may require that any as-\\nsumption as to the effects of failures and likely combination of failures be verified by test. \\n(c) The primary failure of certain sin-\\ngle elements cannot be sensibly esti-mated in numerical terms.

Each engine must be sub-\\njected to an endurance test that in-cludes a total of at least 150 hours of operation and, depending upon the type and contemplated use of the engine, consists of one of the series of runs specified in paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section, as applicable. For en-gines tested under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e) or (g) of this section, the pre-scribed 6-hour test sequence must be conducted 25 times to complete the re-quired 150 hours of operation.

This can be accomplished by increasing test speed, temperature, and/or loads. \\n(2) When an engine test is being used \\nto demonstrate compliance with the overspeed conditions listed in para-graph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section and the failure of a component or system is sudden and transient, it may not be possible to operate the engine for 5 minutes after the failure. Under these circumstances, the actual overspeed duration is acceptable if the required \\nmaximum overspeed is achieved. \\n(b) When determining the maximum \\noverspeed condition applicable to each rotor in order to comply with para-graphs (a) and (c) of this section, the applicant must evaluate the following rotor speeds taking into consideration the part’s operating temperatures and temperature gradients throughout the engine’s operating envelope: \\n(1) 120 percent of the maximum per-\\nmissible rotor speed associated with any of the engine ratings except one- engine-inoperative (OEI) ratings of less than 2\\n1⁄2minutes. \\n(2) 115 percent of the maximum per-\\nmissible rotor speed associated with any OEI ratings of less than 2\\n1⁄2min-\\nutes. \\n(3) 105 percent of the highest rotor \\nspeed that would result from either: \\n(i) The failure of the component or \\nsystem which, in a representative in-stallation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any rating condition ex-cept OEI ratings of less than 2\\n1⁄2min-\\nutes, or \\n(ii) The failure of any component or \\nsystem in a representative installation of the engine, in combination with any other failure of a component or system \\nthat would not normally be detected during a routine pre-flight check or during normal flight operation, that is the most critical with respect to over-speed, except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, when operating at any rating condition except OEI rat-ings of less than 2\\n1⁄2minutes. \\n(4) 100 percent of the highest rotor \\nspeed that would result from the fail-ure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with re-spect to overspeed when operating at any OEI rating of less than 2\\n1⁄2min-\\nutes. \\n(c) The highest overspeed that results \\nfrom a complete loss of load on a tur-bine rotor, except as provided by para-graph (f) of this section, must be in-cluded in the overspeed conditions con-sidered by paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), and (b)(4) of this section, re-gardless of whether that overspeed re-sults from a failure within the engine \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 08:58 Oct 12, 2022 Jkt 256046 PO 00000 Frm 00712 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256046.XXX 256046lhorne on DSKJLZT7X2PROD with CFR\\n703 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT § 33.28 \\nor external to the engine.

The ap-plicant must use the approach in para-graph (a) of this section which specifies the required test conditions. \\n(1) Rotor Growth must not cause the \\nengine to: \\n(i) Catch fire, (ii) Release high-energy debris \\nthrough the engine casing or result in a hazardous failure of the engine cas-ing, \\n(iii) Generate loads greater than \\nthose ultimate loads specified in §33.23(a), or \\n(iv) Lose the capability of being shut \\ndown. \\n(2) Following an overspeed event and \\nafter continued operation, the rotor may not exhibit conditions such as cracking or distortion which preclude continued safe operation. \\n(e) The design and functioning of en-\\ngine control systems, instruments, and other methods not covered under §33.28 must ensure that the engine operating limitations that affect turbine, com-pressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotor structural integrity will not be exceeded in service. \\n(f) Failure of a shaft section may be \\nexcluded from consideration in deter-mining the highest overspeed that would result from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor if the applicant: \\n(1) Identifies the shaft as an engine \\nlife-limited-part and complies with §33.70. \\n(2) Uses material and design features \\nthat are well understood and that can be analyzed by well-established and \\nvalidated stress analysis techniques. \\n(3) Determines, based on an assess-\\nment of the environment surrounding the shaft section, that environmental influences are unlikely to cause a shaft failure.

The tool must be validated for each material. The rotor being cer-tified must not exceed the boundaries of the rotors being used to validate the analytical tool in terms of geometric shape, operating stress, and tempera-ture.

Engine life-limited parts are rotor and major static structural parts whose primary failure is likely to result in a haz-ardous engine effect. Typically, engine life-limited parts include, but are not limited to disks, spacers, hubs, shafts, high-pressure casings, and non-redun-dant mount components. For the pur-poses of this section, a hazardous en-gine effect is any of the conditions list-ed in §33.75 of this part. The applicant will establish the integrity of each en-gine life-limited part by: \\n(a) An engineering plan that contains \\nthe steps required to ensure each en-gine life-limited part is withdrawn from service at an approved life before hazardous engine effects can occur. These steps include validated analysis, test, or service experience which en-sures that the combination of loads, material properties, environmental in-fluences and operating conditions, in-cluding the effects of other engine parts influencing these parameters, are sufficiently well known and predictable so that the operating limitations can be established and maintained for each engine life-limited part. Applicants \\nmust perform appropriate damage tol-erance assessments to address the po-tential for failure from material, man-ufacturing, and service induced anoma-lies within the approved life of the part. Applicants must publish a list of the life-limited engine parts and the approved life for each part in the Air-worthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthi-ness as required by §33.4 of this part. \\n(b) A manufacturing plan that identi-\\nfies the specific manufacturing con-straints necessary to consistently produce each engine life-limited part with the attributes required by the en-gineering plan. \\n(c) A service management plan that \\ndefines in-service processes for mainte-nance and the limitations to repair for each engine life-limited part that will maintain attributes consistent with those required by the engineering plan.

Any engine part the failure of which could reasonably result in a hazardous engine effect must be clearly identified in this summary. \\n(3) The applicant must show that \\nhazardous engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as extremely remote (prob-ability range of 10\\n¥7to 10¥9per engine \\nflight hour). Since the estimated prob-ability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the ap-plicant to assess the total rate for haz-\\nardous engine effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous engine effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater than 10\\n¥8 \\nper engine flight hour. In dealing with probabilities of this low order of mag-nitude, absolute proof is not possible, and compliance may be shown by reli-ance on engineering judgment and pre-vious experience combined with sound design and test philosophies. \\n(4) The applicant must show that \\nmajor engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that de-fined as remote (probability range of 10\\n¥5to 10¥7per engine flight hour). \\n(b) The FAA may require that any as-\\nsumption as to the effects of failures and likely combination of failures be verified by test. \\n(c) The primary failure of certain sin-\\ngle elements cannot be sensibly esti-mated in numerical terms. If the fail-ure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous engine effects, then com-pliance may be shown by reliance on the prescribed integrity requirements of §§33.15, 33.27, and 33.70 as applicable. These instances must be stated in the safety analysis. \\n(d) If reliance is placed on a safety \\nsystem to prevent a failure from pro-gressing to hazardous engine effects, the possibility of a safety system fail-ure in combination with a basic engine failure must be included in the anal-ysis.

(1) The ingestion of \\nlarge hailstones (0.8 to 0.9 specific grav-\\nity) at the maximum true air speed, up to 15,000 feet (4,500 meters), associated with a representative aircraft oper-ating in rough air, with the engine at maximum continuous power, may not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss after the ingestion, or require the en-gine to be shut down. One-half the number of hailstones shall be aimed randomly over the inlet face area and the other half aimed at the critical inlet face area. The hailstones shall be ingested in a rapid sequence to simu-late a hailstone encounter and the \\nnumber and size of the hailstones shall be determined as follows: \\n(i) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) diame-\\nter hailstone for engines with inlet areas of not more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters). \\n(ii) One 1-inch (25 millimeters) di-\\nameter and one 2-inch (50 millimeters) diameter hailstone for each 150 square inches (0.0968 square meters) of inlet area, or fraction thereof, for engines with inlet areas of more than 100 square inches (0.0645 square meters). \\n(2) In addition to complying with \\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section and ex-cept as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, it must be shown that each engine is capable of acceptable op-eration throughout its specified oper-ating envelope when subjected to sud-den encounters with the certification standard concentrations of rain and \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 08:58 Oct 12, 2022 Jkt 256046 PO 00000 Frm 00733 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256046.XXX 256046lhorne on DSKJLZT7X2PROD with CFR\\n724 14 CFR Ch.

Acceptable engine operation pre-cludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability, during any three minute continuous period in rain and during any 30 second continuous period in hail. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies. \\n(b) Engines for rotorcraft. As an alter-\\nnative to the requirements specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, for rotorcraft turbine engines only, it must be shown that each engine is ca-pable of acceptable operation during and after the ingestion of rain with an overall ratio of water droplet flow to airflow, by weight, with a uniform dis-tribution at the inlet plane, of at least four percent. Acceptable engine oper-ation precludes flameout, run down, continued or non-recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and decel-eration capability. It must also be shown after the ingestion that there is no unacceptable mechanical damage, unacceptable power loss, or other ad-verse engine anomalies. The rain inges-tion must occur under the following static ground level conditions: \\n(1) A normal stabilization period at \\ntake-off power without rain ingestion, followed immediately by the suddenly commencing ingestion of rain for three minutes at takeoff power, then \\n(2) Continuation of the rain ingestion \\nduring subsequent rapid deceleration to minimum idle, then \\n(3) Continuation of the rain ingestion \\nduring three minutes at minimum idle power to be certified for flight oper-ation, then \\n(4) Continuation of the rain ingestion \\nduring subsequent rapid acceleration to takeoff power. \\n(c) Engines for supersonic airplanes. In \\naddition to complying with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, a sepa-rate test for supersonic airplane en-gines only, shall be conducted with three hailstones ingested at supersonic cruise velocity. These hailstones shall be aimed at the engine’s critical face area, and their ingestion must not cause unacceptable mechanical damage or unacceptable power or thrust loss \\nafter the ingestion or require the en-gine to be shut down. The size of these hailstones shall be determined from the linear variation in diameter from 1- inch (25 millimeters) at 35,000 feet (10,500 meters) to \\n1⁄4-inch (6 millime-\\nters) at 60,000 feet (18,000 meters) using the diameter corresponding to the low-est expected supersonic cruise altitude. Alternatively, three larger hailstones may be ingested at subsonic velocities such that the kinetic energy of these larger hailstones is equivalent to the applicable supersonic ingestion condi-tions. \\n(d) For an engine that incorporates \\nor requires the use of a protection de-vice, demonstration of the rain and hail ingestion capabilities of the en-gine, as required in paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section, may be waived wholly or in part by the Administrator if the applicant shows that: \\n(1) The subject rain and hail con-\\nstituents are of a size that will not pass through the protection device; \\n(2) The protection device will with-\\nstand the impact of the subject rain and hail constituents; and \\n(3) The subject of rain and hail con-\\nstituents, stopped by the protection de-vice, will not obstruct the flow of in-duction air into the engine, resulting in damage, power or thrust loss, or other adverse engine anomalies in ex-cess of what would be accepted in para-graphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. \\n[Doc.

For en-gines with augmented takeoff power ratings that do not materially increase operating severity, the amount of run-ning conducted at the augmented rat-ing is determined by the FAA. In changing the power setting after each period, the power-control lever must be moved in the manner prescribed in \\nparagraph (b)(5) of this section. \\n(2) Rated maximum continuous and \\ntakeoff power or thrust.

One hour of al-\\nternate 5-minute periods at rated take-off power and at idling power. The de-veloped powers at takeoff and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature condi-tions must be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule established by the applicant. During any one period, the rotor speed and power may be controlled manually while taking data to check perform-ance. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve in-creases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power must be at the augmented power rating. In changing the power setting after each period, the power control lever must be moved in the manner prescribed in paragraph (c)(6) of this section. \\n(2) Rated maximum continuous and \\ntakeoff power.

For engines oper-ating at constant speed, power may be varied in place of speed. If there are \\nsignificant peak vibrations anywhere between ground idle and maximum continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen must be changed to increase the amount of running con-\\nducted while subject to peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent in incremental run-ning. \\n(6) Acceleration and deceleration runs. \\nThirty minutes of accelerations and de-celerations, consisting of six cycles from idling power to rated takeoff power and maintained at the takeoff power lever position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for approximately 4\\n1⁄2minutes. In com-\\nplying with this paragraph, the power control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the other in not more than one second. If, however, dif-ferent regimes of control operations are incorporated that necessitate scheduling of the power control lever motion from one extreme position to the other, then a longer period of time is acceptable, but not more than two seconds. \\n(7) Starts. One hundred starts, of \\nwhich 25 starts must be preceded by at least a two-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false engine starts, pausing for the applicant’s spec-ified minimum fuel drainage time, be-fore attempting a normal start. There must be at least 10 normal restarts not more than 15 minutes after engine shutdown. The remaining starts may be made after completing the 150 hours of endurance testing. \\n(d) Rotorcraft engines for which a con-\\ntinuous OEI rating is desired.

One hundred starts, of \\nwhich 25 starts must be preceded by at least a 2-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false engine starts, pausing for the applicant’s specified minimum fuel drainage time, before at-tempting a normal start.

For \\neach rotorcraft engine for which a 21⁄2- \\nminute OEI power rating is desired, the applicant must conduct the following series of tests: \\n(1) Takeoff, 2\\n1⁄2-minute OEI, and idling. \\nOne hour of alternate 5-minute periods at rated takeoff power and at idling power except that, during the third and sixth takeoff power periods, only 2\\n1⁄2 \\nminutes need be conducted at rated takeoff power, and the remaining 2\\n1⁄2 \\nminutes must be conducted at rated 2\\n1⁄2-minute OEI power. The developed \\npowers at takeoff, 21⁄2-minute OEI, and \\nidling conditions and their cor-responding rotor speed and gas tem-perature conditions must be as estab-lished by the power control in accord-ance with the schedule established by the applicant. The applicant may, dur-ing any one period, control manually the rotor speed and power while taking data to check performance.

An appli-cant without adequate service data must show experience with and knowl-edge of problem mitigating design practices equivalent to that gained from actual service experience in a manner acceptable to the FAA. \\n(c) Except as specified in paragraph \\n(f) of this section, the applicant must conduct a simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test in accordance with an approved test plan on an en-gine that substantially conforms to the type design. The test must: \\n(1) Include a minimum of 3,000 rep-\\nresentative service start-stop mission cycles and three simulated diversion cycles at maximum continuous thrust or power for the maximum diversion \\ntime for which ETOPS eligibility is sought. Each start-stop mission cycle must include the use of take-off, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing thrust or power and the use of thrust \\nreverse (if applicable). The diversions must be evenly distributed over the du-ration of the test. The last diversion must be conducted within 100 cycles of the completion of the test. \\n(2) Be performed with the high speed \\nand low speed main engine rotors inde-pendently unbalanced to obtain a min-imum of 90 percent of the rec-ommended field service maintenance vibration levels. For engines with three main engine rotors, the intermediate speed rotor must be independently un-balanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended produc-tion acceptance vibration level. The re-quired peak vibration levels must be verified during a slow acceleration and deceleration run of the test engine cov-ering the main engine rotor operating speed ranges. \\n(3) Include a minimum of three mil-\\nlion vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the typical high- speed rotor start-stop mission cycle. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the typical service start-stop cycle speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm, the minimum number of vibration cycles must be lin-early increased up to ten million cycles for a 200 rpm incremental step. \\n(4) Include a minimum of 300,000 vi-\\nbration cycles for each 60 rpm incre-mental step of the high-speed rotor ap-proved operational speed range be-tween minimum flight idle and cruise power not covered by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The test may be con-ducted using any rotor speed step in-crement from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the applicable speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm the minimum number of vibration cycles must be lin-early increased up to 1 million for a 200 rpm incremental step. \\n(5) Include vibration surveys at peri-\\nodic intervals throughout the test. The equivalent value of the peak vibration level observed during the surveys must meet the minimum vibration require-ment of §33.201(c)(2). \\n(d) Prior to the test required by para-\\ngraph (c) of this section, the engine must be subjected to a calibration test \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 08:58 Oct 12, 2022 Jkt 256046 PO 00000 Frm 00746 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256046.XXX 256046lhorne on DSKJLZT7X2PROD with CFR\\n737 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT Pt. 33, App. A \\nto document power and thrust charac-\\nteristics. \\n(e) At the conclusion of the testing \\nrequired by paragraph (c) of this sec-tion, the engine must: \\n(1) Be subjected to a calibration test \\nat sea-level conditions.

This can be accomplished by increasing test speed, temperature, and/or loads. \\n(2) When an engine test is being used \\nto demonstrate compliance with the overspeed conditions listed in para-graph (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section and the failure of a component or system is sudden and transient, it may not be possible to operate the engine for 5 minutes after the failure. Under these circumstances, the actual overspeed duration is acceptable if the required \\nmaximum overspeed is achieved. \\n(b) When determining the maximum \\noverspeed condition applicable to each rotor in order to comply with para-graphs (a) and (c) of this section, the applicant must evaluate the following rotor speeds taking into consideration the part’s operating temperatures and temperature gradients throughout the engine’s operating envelope: \\n(1) 120 percent of the maximum per-\\nmissible rotor speed associated with any of the engine ratings except one- engine-inoperative (OEI) ratings of less than 2\\n1⁄2minutes. \\n(2) 115 percent of the maximum per-\\nmissible rotor speed associated with any OEI ratings of less than 2\\n1⁄2min-\\nutes. \\n(3) 105 percent of the highest rotor \\nspeed that would result from either: \\n(i) The failure of the component or \\nsystem which, in a representative in-stallation of the engine, is the most critical with respect to overspeed when operating at any rating condition ex-cept OEI ratings of less than 2\\n1⁄2min-\\nutes, or \\n(ii) The failure of any component or \\nsystem in a representative installation of the engine, in combination with any other failure of a component or system \\nthat would not normally be detected during a routine pre-flight check or during normal flight operation, that is the most critical with respect to over-speed, except as provided by paragraph (c) of this section, when operating at any rating condition except OEI rat-ings of less than 2\\n1⁄2minutes. \\n(4) 100 percent of the highest rotor \\nspeed that would result from the fail-ure of the component or system which, in a representative installation of the engine, is the most critical with re-spect to overspeed when operating at any OEI rating of less than 2\\n1⁄2min-\\nutes. \\n(c) The highest overspeed that results \\nfrom a complete loss of load on a tur-bine rotor, except as provided by para-graph (f) of this section, must be in-cluded in the overspeed conditions con-sidered by paragraphs (b)(3)(i), (b)(3)(ii), and (b)(4) of this section, re-gardless of whether that overspeed re-sults from a failure within the engine \\nVerDate Sep<11>2014 08:58 Oct 12, 2022 Jkt 256046 PO 00000 Frm 00712 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Y:\\\\SGML\\\\256046.XXX 256046lhorne on DSKJLZT7X2PROD with CFR\\n703 Federal Aviation Administration, DOT § 33.28 \\nor external to the engine. The over-\\nspeed resulting from any other single failure must be considered when select-\\ning the most limiting overspeed condi-tions applicable to each rotor. Over-speeds resulting from combinations of failures must also be considered unless the applicant can show that the prob-ability of occurrence is not greater than extremely remote (probability range of 10\\n¥7to 10¥9per engine flight \\nhour). \\n(d) In addition, the applicant must \\ndemonstrate that each fan, compressor, turbine, and turbosupercharger rotor complies with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section for the maximum overspeed achieved when subjected to the conditions specified in paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section. The ap-plicant must use the approach in para-graph (a) of this section which specifies the required test conditions. \\n(1) Rotor Growth must not cause the \\nengine to: \\n(i) Catch fire, (ii) Release high-energy debris \\nthrough the engine casing or result in a hazardous failure of the engine cas-ing, \\n(iii) Generate loads greater than \\nthose ultimate loads specified in §33.23(a), or \\n(iv) Lose the capability of being shut \\ndown. \\n(2) Following an overspeed event and \\nafter continued operation, the rotor may not exhibit conditions such as cracking or distortion which preclude continued safe operation. \\n(e) The design and functioning of en-\\ngine control systems, instruments, and other methods not covered under §33.28 must ensure that the engine operating limitations that affect turbine, com-pressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotor structural integrity will not be exceeded in service. \\n(f) Failure of a shaft section may be \\nexcluded from consideration in deter-mining the highest overspeed that would result from a complete loss of load on a turbine rotor if the applicant: \\n(1) Identifies the shaft as an engine \\nlife-limited-part and complies with §33.70. \\n(2) Uses material and design features \\nthat are well understood and that can be analyzed by well-established and \\nvalidated stress analysis techniques. \\n(3) Determines, based on an assess-\\nment of the environment surrounding the shaft section, that environmental influences are unlikely to cause a shaft failure. This assessment must include complexity of design, corrosion, wear, vibration, fire, contact with adjacent components or structure, overheating, and secondary effects from other fail-ures or combination of failures. \\n(4) Identifies and declares, in accord-\\nance with §33.5, any assumptions re-garding the engine installation in mak-ing the assessment described above in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. \\n(5) Assesses, and considers as appro-\\npriate, experience with shaft sections \\nof similar design. \\n(6) Does not exclude the entire shaft. (g) If analysis is used to meet the \\noverspeed requirements, then the ana-lytical tool must be validated to prior overspeed test results of a similar rotor. The tool must be validated for each material. The rotor being cer-tified must not exceed the boundaries of the rotors being used to validate the analytical tool in terms of geometric shape, operating stress, and tempera-ture. Validation includes the ability to accurately predict rotor dimensional growth and the burst speed. The pre-dictions must also show that the rotor being certified does not have lower burst and growth margins than rotors used to validate the tool. \\n[Doc.

In addi-tion, the following provisions apply to each strainer or filter required by this paragraph (b): \\n(1) It must be accessible for draining \\nand cleaning and must incorporate a screen or element that is easily remov-able. \\n(2) It must have a sediment trap and \\ndrain except that it need not have a drain if the strainer or filter is easily removable for drain purposes. \\n(3) It must be mounted so that its \\nweight is not supported by the con-necting lines or by the inlet or outlet connections of the strainer or filter, unless adequate strength margins under all loading conditions are pro-vided in the lines and connections. \\n(4) It must have the type and degree \\nof fuel filtering specified as necessary for protection of the engine fuel system against foreign particles in the fuel. The applicant must show: \\n(i) That foreign particles passing \\nthrough the specified filtering means do not impair the engine fuel system functioning; and \\n(ii) That the fuel system is capable of \\nsustained operation throughout its flow and pressure range with the fuel initially saturated with water at 80 °F \\n(27 °C) and having 0.025 fluid ounces per \\ngallon (0.20 milliliters per liter) of free water added and cooled to the most critical condition for icing likely to be encountered in operation.

Any engine part the failure of which could reasonably result in a hazardous engine effect must be clearly identified in this summary. \\n(3) The applicant must show that \\nhazardous engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as extremely remote (prob-ability range of 10\\n¥7to 10¥9per engine \\nflight hour). Since the estimated prob-ability for individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the ap-plicant to assess the total rate for haz-\\nardous engine effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous engine effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater than 10\\n¥8 \\nper engine flight hour. In dealing with probabilities of this low order of mag-nitude, absolute proof is not possible, and compliance may be shown by reli-ance on engineering judgment and pre-vious experience combined with sound design and test philosophies. \\n(4) The applicant must show that \\nmajor engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that de-fined as remote (probability range of 10\\n¥5to 10¥7per engine flight hour). \\n(b) The FAA may require that any as-\\nsumption as to the effects of failures and likely combination of failures be verified by test. \\n(c) The primary failure of certain sin-\\ngle elements cannot be sensibly esti-mated in numerical terms. If the fail-ure of such elements is likely to result in hazardous engine effects, then com-pliance may be shown by reliance on the prescribed integrity requirements of §§33.15, 33.27, and 33.70 as applicable. These instances must be stated in the safety analysis. \\n(d) If reliance is placed on a safety \\nsystem to prevent a failure from pro-gressing to hazardous engine effects, the possibility of a safety system fail-ure in combination with a basic engine failure must be included in the anal-ysis. Such a safety system may include safety devices, instrumentation, early warning devices, maintenance checks, and other similar equipment or proce-dures.

For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve increases in turbine inlet tem-perature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at takeoff must be at the augmented rating. For en-gines with augmented takeoff power ratings that do not materially increase operating severity, the amount of run-ning conducted at the augmented rat-ing is determined by the FAA.

One hour of al-\\nternate 5-minute periods at rated take-off power and at idling power. The de-veloped powers at takeoff and idling conditions and their corresponding rotor speed and gas temperature condi-tions must be as established by the power control in accordance with the schedule established by the applicant. During any one period, the rotor speed and power may be controlled manually while taking data to check perform-ance. For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve in-creases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power must be at the augmented power rating.

Two \\nhours and 30 minutes at the successive power lever positions corresponding with not less than 15 approximately equal speed and time increments be-tween maximum continuous engine ro-tational speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For engines oper-ating at constant speed, power may be varied in place of speed. If there are \\nsignificant peak vibrations anywhere between ground idle and maximum continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen must be changed to increase the amount of running con-\\nducted while subject to peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent in incremental run-ning. \\n(6) Acceleration and deceleration runs. \\nThirty minutes of accelerations and de-celerations, consisting of six cycles from idling power to rated takeoff power and maintained at the takeoff power lever position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for approximately 4\\n1⁄2minutes. In com-\\nplying with this paragraph, the power control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the other in not more than one second. If, however, dif-ferent regimes of control operations are incorporated that necessitate scheduling of the power control lever motion from one extreme position to the other, then a longer period of time is acceptable, but not more than two seconds. \\n(7) Starts. One hundred starts, of \\nwhich 25 starts must be preceded by at least a two-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false engine starts, pausing for the applicant’s spec-ified minimum fuel drainage time, be-fore attempting a normal start.

For engines with augmented takeoff power ratings that involve in-creases in turbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, this period of running at rated takeoff power must be at the augmented power rating. In changing the power setting after each period, the power control lever must be moved in the manner prescribed in paragraph (d)(6) of this section. \\n(2) Rated maximum continuous and \\ntakeoff power. Thirty minutes at— \\n(i) Rated maximum continuous power \\nduring fifteen of the twenty-five 6-hour endurance test cycles; and \\n(ii) Rated takeoff power during ten of \\nthe twenty-five 6-hour endurance test cycles. \\n(3) Rated continuous OEI power. One \\nhour at rated continuous OEI power. \\n(4) Rated maximum continuous power. \\nOne hour at rated maximum contin-uous power. \\n(5) Incremental cruise power. Two \\nhours at the successive power lever po-sitions corresponding with not less than 12 approximately equal speed and time increments between maximum continuous engine rotational speed and ground or minimum idle rotational speed. For engines operating at con-stant speed, power may be varied in place of speed. If there are significant peak vibrations anywhere between ground idle and maximum continuous conditions, the number of increments chosen must be changed to increase the amount of running conducted while being subjected to the peak vibrations up to not more than 50 percent of the total time spent in incremental run-ning. \\n(6) Acceleration and deceleration runs. \\nThirty minutes of accelerations and de-celerations, consisting of six cycles from idling power to rated takeoff power and maintained at the takeoff power lever position for 30 seconds and at the idling power lever position for approximately 4\\n1⁄2minutes. In com-\\nplying with this paragraph, the power control lever must be moved from one extreme position to the other in not more than 1 second, except that if dif-ferent regimes of control operations are incorporated necessitating sched-uling of the power control lever motion in going from one extreme position to the other, a longer period of time is ac-\\nceptable, but not more than 2 seconds. \\n(7) Starts. One hundred starts, of \\nwhich 25 starts must be preceded by at least a 2-hour engine shutdown. There must be at least 10 false engine starts, pausing for the applicant’s specified minimum fuel drainage time, before at-tempting a normal start.

An appli-cant without adequate service data must show experience with and knowl-edge of problem mitigating design practices equivalent to that gained from actual service experience in a manner acceptable to the FAA. \\n(c) Except as specified in paragraph \\n(f) of this section, the applicant must conduct a simulated ETOPS mission cyclic endurance test in accordance with an approved test plan on an en-gine that substantially conforms to the type design. The test must: \\n(1) Include a minimum of 3,000 rep-\\nresentative service start-stop mission cycles and three simulated diversion cycles at maximum continuous thrust or power for the maximum diversion \\ntime for which ETOPS eligibility is sought. Each start-stop mission cycle must include the use of take-off, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing thrust or power and the use of thrust \\nreverse (if applicable). The diversions must be evenly distributed over the du-ration of the test. The last diversion must be conducted within 100 cycles of the completion of the test. \\n(2) Be performed with the high speed \\nand low speed main engine rotors inde-pendently unbalanced to obtain a min-imum of 90 percent of the rec-ommended field service maintenance vibration levels. For engines with three main engine rotors, the intermediate speed rotor must be independently un-balanced to obtain a minimum of 90 percent of the recommended produc-tion acceptance vibration level. The re-quired peak vibration levels must be verified during a slow acceleration and deceleration run of the test engine cov-ering the main engine rotor operating speed ranges. \\n(3) Include a minimum of three mil-\\nlion vibration cycles for each 60 rpm incremental step of the typical high- speed rotor start-stop mission cycle. The test may be conducted using any rotor speed step increment from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the typical service start-stop cycle speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm, the minimum number of vibration cycles must be lin-early increased up to ten million cycles for a 200 rpm incremental step. \\n(4) Include a minimum of 300,000 vi-\\nbration cycles for each 60 rpm incre-mental step of the high-speed rotor ap-proved operational speed range be-tween minimum flight idle and cruise power not covered by paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The test may be con-ducted using any rotor speed step in-crement from 60 to 200 rpm provided the test encompasses the applicable speed range. For incremental steps greater than 60 rpm the minimum number of vibration cycles must be lin-early increased up to 1 million for a 200 rpm incremental step. \\n(5) Include vibration surveys at peri-\\nodic intervals throughout the test.

This advisory circular (AC) describes an  acceptable method, but not the only \\nmethod, to support certain  comparative assessment  compliance finding s to Title 14 of the Code \\nof Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 33, § 33.15, Materials , for turbine engine projects. \\nComparative assessment of certain  data is  often  necessary  to show the required functional and \\ndurability e quivalencies between engine combus tor and turbine section parts from different \\ndesign or manufacturing processes , e.g., parts manufacturer approvals ( PMA ) versus type design  \\nparts.  These equivalencies relate to oxidation, hot corrosion, and thermal fatigue and erosion \\ncharacteristics  in th e engine environment.

Applicability . \\na. The guidance in this document is for applicants requesting FAA approval for PMA , TC \\ndesign change, STC , or repair  or alteration  of turbine engine and APU parts. For the purpose of \\nthis AC, we will collectively refer to t hese par ts as “ replacement parts ,” and the term “engine” is \\ndefined as a propulsion turbine engine or an APU. We intend this guidance to support \\ncomparative test and analysis design -approval projects. The guidance in this AC may also have \\napplication to other turbine devices such as  turbochargers or superchargers. \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance with the applicable re gulations. We will consider  other methods of demonstrating compliance \\nthat an applicant may elect to present. Terms such as “should,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used. While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the relevant regulations.

Advisory Circular 33- 10, Statistical Analysis Considerations for Comparative \\nTest and Analysis Based Compliance Findings for Turbine Engine and Auxiliary Power Unit \\nReplacement, Redesign and Repaired Parts , dated August 28, 2014.  \\n4. Background .  \\na. For comparative test and analysis design approval pr ojects, materials validation  \\n(compliance with  § 33.15) requires a detailed comparison of  the proposed rep lacement part to the \\nexisting type design  part. This work generally requires  comparisons  of a variety of physical and \\nmechanical  properties and characteristics  associated with  the materials and manufacturing \\nprocesses  involved. Development of replacement parts may arise from different factors , \\nincluding durability or performance improvement , manufacturing process improvement , cost \\nreduction, or other commercial reasons.  \\nb. Combustor and t urbine  section gas path parts are exposed to a variety of effects when \\nsubjected to the extreme con ditions associated with turbine engine operation. For gas path  and \\ncertain  main  rotor  parts , like  combustors, disks , spools , spacers,  turbine  blades, vanes , cases , and  \\ntheir non- rotating  seals , the effects of oxidation, hot corrosion, thermal  fatigue , and erosion are \\nof critical  importance to the performance of these parts  in service. Therefore, testing is often \\nneeded to reliably predict the behavior of parts and  effectiveness of  coatings  (environmental and \\nthermal barrier)  in an  engine.  The testing normally needed is  of a dynamic nature, because \\ntraditional static tests may not adequately replicate an engine environment. For example, the \\neffects noted above can occur simultaneously in an engine environment and, therefore, cannot be evaluated by independent static tests. However, overall test methods  (static /dynamic/engine)  \\nshould be developed based on the function and operating environment of the part, and test objective. The specific test requirements will be determined during de velopment of the  approved \\ncompliance plan for the project. Test methods other than the burner rig method described in this AC, could be suitable alternatives to gathering the required information, depending on test objective. For example, alternative test methods could be acceptable where the dynamic characteristics of engine airflow are not significant to the test objective. Such proposals will be evaluated on a case- by-case basis.   \\nc. This AC provides guidance for how burner rig testing may be used to show c ompliance \\nto § 33.15 for comparative assessments, and describes an acceptable test method and criteria.  \\n5. Comparative  Tests . The comparative material tests described in the subparagraphs below \\nmay be necessary to adequately support compliance to § 33.15, for  combustor or turbine section \\ngas path replacement parts, where the base material , coating specifications , or braze /weld \\nmaterials  are not identical to the type design part, as determined by patent evaluation, formal \\nmaterial certification documentation, material reverse engineering, manufacturing process es, etc. \\nThese parts include, but are not limited to, rotor assemblies, combustor assemblies, turbine blades, turbine vanes, turbine cases, and their non- rotating seals. For these parts, applicants must \\nshow that the replacement part durability characteristics for oxidation, hot corrosion, thermal fatigue, and erosion are at least equivalent to the type design part when operated in an engine. Part durability characteristics can include both time -to-failure and the actual failure mechanisms. \\n2 \\n \\n9/23/14                      AC 33 -11 \\nApplicants can perform v arious tests to collect the data needed for this showing. Such testing \\nmost often uses material specimens (coupons), but could use actual parts in certain cases.  \\na. Part and Material Characteristics . Applicants must evaluate t he following part and \\nmaterial characteristics , as applicable, in an engine operating environment:  \\n(1) Corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of the surface coating or base metal of a \\npart by chemical reaction with the  various const ituents of  the engine core gas stream . Corrosion \\nmay also result from galvanic action between mating parts  (e.g., mating of dissimilar metals  at \\nbraze/weld joints ). \\n(2) Oxidation . Oxidation is  a form of corrosion that involves  the chemical reaction of \\noxygen i n the gas stream with the surface coating or base metal of the part. This chemical \\nreaction creates oxide molecules as it consumes the coating or base metal. The oxides generally \\nbuild up as a coating (oxide film) on the part surface, but can also be inter granular or below the \\nexternal surface of the base metal. Oxidation will consume these materials at some rate and, in \\nextreme cases , may prevent normal functioning or cause premature fail ure of the part . Oxidation \\nis the most prevalent form of corrosion in aircraft engines.  \\n(3) Hot corrosion. Hot corrosion is a special case of oxidation process that occurs w hen \\na normally protective  oxide film layer  is degraded or destroyed by a salt -based  deposit (e.g., \\nsodium sulfate) , and is unable to reform  or protect the base metal . Hot corrosion is a specific  and \\nimportant  form of corrosion in turbine engines , and can occur at various operating temperatures \\nbetween low and high power . There are various chemical mechanisms involved, which vary \\nbetween coating, base metal , and gas constituent combinations. Hot corrosion typically occurs \\nwhen  salts form in the gas stream and  react with protective oxide films on the part surface, then \\ncause that protective layer to break down and not be  able to reform. This results in a continuous \\nchemical reaction of the base metal with oxygen and consumption of base metal structure  until \\nthe part fail s or no longer performs its intended func tion. Therefore , hot corrosion is  an \\naccelerated oxidation process  that can have serious implications  for engine operation and aircraft \\nsafety . Hot corrosion is the primary form of corrosion that attacks  hot section turbine  \\ncomponents. P hosphates  and other gas path constituents  can also contribute to hot corrosion, \\ndepending upon material selection. These ca n have  effect s similar to  sodium sulfates. \\n(4) Thermal Fatigue . In an operating engine, thermal and mechanical stresses applied \\nto a part can result in fatigue damage. For certain parts, t hermal ly induced fatigue can  be \\nsignificant, and may  result in cracking  of a surface coating or base metal , or spalling of a \\nprotective oxide layer . The cracking  or spalling  results from  the repeated application of  thermal ly \\ninduced stresses due to rapid and non- uniform heating and cooling  cycles  during engine \\ntransients.  Such  effects  can allow the gas stream to impinge on the base me tal and accelerate the \\noverall oxidation process , leading to part failure . These conditions are often responsible for \\nthermal fatigue damage accumulation in hot section parts  in service. This AC pr imarily addresses  \\nthermal fatigue  concerns for  protective coatings  applied over  the base metal  of gas path parts  to \\nshow coating durability  and effectiveness . \\n(5) Erosion. Aircraft engines are subject to erosion damage by contaminants in t he core \\ngas stream. T he erodent s are generally small particles of sand, dust , or other airborne pollutants \\ningested from the surrounding environment. The shedding of particles from upstream engine components (e.g., combustor) can also be a source of particulate matter. Erosion can cause the \\n3 \\n \\n9/23/14                      AC 33 -11 \\npremature wear -out of protective coatings , degradation of protective oxide scales, or cause \\npitting damage to the base metal surface. These conditions could have  a negative effect on  the \\nperformance or durability of the replacement part.  \\nb. Burner Rig Test  Method .  \\n(1) The overall intent of this  comparative test method is to  generate adequate data t o \\nshow that the propose d part i s at least equal to the type design  part relative to overall oxidation, \\nhot corrosion, thermal fatigue , and erosion resis tance when operated in an aircraft turbine engine . \\nWhile the best method to evaluate these characteristics is during actual engine operation, in most \\ncases , this will not be practical and  simple  static tests in air do not simulate an engine \\nenvironment. Th erefore, a fuel burner rig can be used to test material specimens or actual  parts  in \\nan environme nt simulating  that of an engine.  Norm ally, these tests  are conducted using  material \\nspecimens  and focus on either bare or coated metal . For testing using actua l parts , the applicant \\nwill need to consider  part size and  how it is installed in the engine. For example, parts with \\ncomplex cooling requirements may require a special test set- up to replicate its boundary \\nconditions . Also, t he burner needs to be sized to provide adequate  coverage for the  size of the \\ntest samples , whether they are specimens  or actual parts.  \\n(2) A fuel burner is a combustion device  that generates a hot gas stream  that attempts \\nto simulate the mixing, flow , and chemistry of the core gas stream i n an engine. However , such \\ndevices do not generally replicate the exhaust gas velocity or internal gas pressure found in a propulsion engine. Normally, a  common commercial type jet fuel ( e.g., Jet A) is used  to power \\nthe burner . The test is conducted by pl acing a test specimen (s) in the exhaust gas of the  fuel \\nburner  for the conditions  defined in the  approved test plan (e.g., t ime, temperature, gas flow \\nconstituents ). Sometimes , multiple test specimens are used simultaneously and placed in  a \\nrotating carous el. The rotation assures that the temperature effects of the gas stream are averaged \\nover all the test specimens throughout  the test period. The gas stream can also have contaminants \\nadded to simulate  hot corrosion or erosive environment s. These contaminan ts can have \\nsignificant effect s on part function and durability ; for example, a diluted and atomized sea salt \\nsolution can be introduced into the burner rig flow to test for hot corrosion. The test can also \\nincorporate thermal cycles to simulate en gine sta rt, shutdown, or power  transients  to address \\nassociated thermal fatigue concerns .  \\n(3) Figure 1 shows a  typical set -up used at a number of  commercial ly available \\nlaboratories . This figure shows the fuel burner, test specimen placement, temperature measuring \\ndevices, and various supply lines and other features of a typical test rig. Such a rig must be \\ncompatible with commercial jet fuels (e.g., Jet A), and have exhaust gas temperature and velocity ranges compatible with the intended engine application. For furth er reading, NASA Report No. \\nNASA/TM -2011- 216986 describes in more detail the design and function of a modern burner rig \\ntest facility having  the capability to conduct  the tests described in this AC. However, t he \\ninformation contained in the NASA report is for information al use only and does not descri be the \\nonly possible test method.  \\n4 \\n \\n9/23/14                      AC 33 -11 \\nFigure 1     \\nTypical Burner Rig Set -Up \\n \\nc. Test Plan ning .  The applicable project  compliance and test plan s should include test \\nconditions addressing oxidation, hot corrosion, t hermal fatigue , and erosion. Back -to-back or \\nsimultaneous testing of samples of both proposed and type design parts , or test specimens, are \\nnecessary  to compare part characteristics. The test plan should specify a sufficient number of test \\nspecimens to provide a statistically significant comparison of results  (see referenced  AC 33- 10 \\nfor related information) . Test speci mens must be processed in the same manner a s production \\nparts with respect to coating thicknesses, substrate heat treatments , and other rela ted parameters. \\nFor example, for  coating performance testing, the test specimens must be designed to ensure that \\ncoating degradation occurs before base metal degradation. If base metal degradation occurs first, \\nthe test results may be invalid. Therefore, t est specimens must reflect actual part processing in \\nthese areas to obtain meaningful comparisons. Test conditions must be representative of an engine operating environment, and typically include alternating heating and cooling periods. The test conditions  must be of sufficient duration and severity so that representative degradation \\noccurs . The  test plan should address the following test conditions , as applicable:  \\n(1) Oxidation . Include test conditio ns that  evaluate part or specimen oxidation over the \\nfull ran ge of engine operating conditions. This test must  include sufficient time at an engine \\noperating temp erature, and sufficient thermal cycling  to demonstrate oxidization  characteristics  \\nand time to failure . Meaningful results may require gas streams of relat ively high velocity  (see \\nparagraph 5.b(3) in this AC ).  \\n(2) Hot Corrosion. Include test conditions  that evaluate part or specimen hot corrosion \\ncharacteristics when  the gas  stream is contaminated with sodium sulfate. This test  must include \\nsufficient time at a n engine  operating temperature to  demonstrate hot corrosion characteristics  \\nover the range of part features  and engine operating conditions .  \\n5 \\n \\n9/23/14                      AC 33 -11 \\n(3) Thermal F atigue . Include test conditions t hat evaluate the durability of coatings (or \\nin some cases base material)  when exposed to thermally induced stresses. This can be \\naccomplished by moving the test specimens in and out of the gas stream  so as to creat e a steep  \\ntemperature gradient  in a manner representing engine operation. This test  must  include sufficient \\ntherma l cycl ing to demonstrate part resistance to thermal fatigue damage.  Multi-layer coatings \\nshould generally be tested as a system, rather than layer -by-layer.  \\n(4)  Erosion. Include test conditions where the gas stream is contaminated with typical \\nerodents  found in a service environment . This test  must include sufficient time in the  erosive \\nenvironment to demonstrate  part or specimen  erosion resistance.  \\nd. Test Results and Equivalence Determination . The following comparisons are useful \\nin showing equivalency:  \\n(1) Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Resistance of Base M etal. Compare the type and \\nthickness of oxide layers, and the overall rate of consumption of the base metal over exposure \\ntime.  Look for overall mass accretion rate if the formed oxides are not removed by the gas \\nstream. U sing metallographic inspections  look for granular or inter -granular oxidation (and \\npenetration depth) and any local de -alloyed base material . This type of oxidation can have a \\nsignificant effect on material mechanical properties  and part function and durability . Pay \\nparticular attention to the effects of hot corrosion on oxi de scale formation and durability , and on \\nbase metal integrity . In some cases , it may be necessary to perform post -test mechanical integrity \\nevaluations to determine whether the oxidation has negatively affected part function or durability.  \\n(2) Oxidation and Hot Corrosion Resistance of Protective C oating . Compare the type \\nand thickness of oxide layers and the consumption rate of the coating over exposure  time , \\nincluding  time s to onset and  coating failure . Look for cracking, spalling , or separation of t he \\ncoating from the base metal.  \\n(a) For separation , observe the effects on the base metal. Pay particular attention \\nto the effects of hot corrosion on oxide scale formation and longevity, and the effects on base metal integrity . Differences in coefficient of thermal expansion between the oxide layer and the \\ncoating can accelerate spalling. Coating microstructure can vary significantly as a function of \\ncoating application method and can result in varying service lives.  \\n(b) For thermal barrier coatings (TBC) that u se a bond coat over the base metal, a \\nkey performance criterion  is susceptibility to TBC spalling  at the TBC/bond coat interface. \\nSpall ing of the TBC can lead to a significant increase in bond coat degradation rate and poor \\ndurability characteristics  of the protective coating .  \\n(3) Thermal Fatigue  Resistance of Protective Coating. Look for cracking or spalling \\nthat result from the applied thermal stresses.  For diffusion coatings, look for cracks propagating \\ninto the base metal.  Observe corrosion resistance , as discussed  in paragraphs  5.d(1) and (2) of \\nthis AC . \\n(4) Erosion Resistance. For base metal and coatings, look for  surface wear, pitting , and \\nother effects  that consume material (e.g., loss of c oating thickness) ; effects that  could change  the \\n6 \\n \\n9/23/14                      AC 33 -11 \\npart shape  (e.g., airfoils) ; or effects that  otherwise  negatively affect part function or durability. \\nThe consumed material could be the base metal, the protective coating, or protective oxide scale.  \\n(5) Other C riteria .  \\n(a) Weight changes (positive/retention or negative/spalling);  \\n(b) Visual inspection for surface damage;  \\n(c) Phases of coating before and after oxidation;  \\n(d) Examin ing for microstructure changes in coatings an d base metal;  \\n(e) Coating phase tra nsformation and volum e increase;  and  \\n(f) Associated cracking  and/or spalling.  \\n(6) The replacement part must show to be , at least , equal to the type design part for the  \\nabove characteristics in terms of part or feature performance and durability .  \\n6. Summary . The  methods of compliance  identified in this AC may be used to show \\ncompliance to § 33.15 for certain material characteristics  using comparative assessment .

This advisory circular (AC) provides guidance and acceptable means, but\\nnot the only means, for demonstrating compliance with the specific requirements \\napplicable to 30-second and 2-minute One-Engine-Inoperative (OEI) rotorcraft turbine engine ratings in part 33 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR part 33).  \\n2.Applicability .\\na.The guidance provided in this document is directed to engine designers,\\nmanufacturers, and modifiers.  \\nb.This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute\\na regulation. It describes acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating \\ncompliance with the applicable regulations. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA, we) will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may elect to present. Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used. While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the relevant regulations. On the other hand, if the FAA becomes aware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance.  \\nc.This material does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or\\npermit deviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n1\\n \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\n3.

The 30-second OEI rating provides a short burst of high power particularly needed \\nby a rotorcraft if one engine fails or is shut down during a critical flight configuration \\nsuch as takeoff, rejected takeoff, or landing. The power levels associated with the 30\\xadsecond and 2-minute OEI ratings would allow the rotorcraft to complete the takeoff or rejected takeoff with the remaining engine(s) and continue into climbout to a safe altitude or airspeed. Similarly, these ratings are intended to provide adequate power to the rotorcraft to execute a safe landing with the remaining engine(s) or a balked landing followed by a climbout.  \\nb. The applicant selects the ratings from the OEI ratings specified in § 33.7. The 30\\xad\\nsecond and 2-minute OEI ratings differ from the other OEI ratings because of their higher power and shorter duration; their limitation to three usages during one flight; and their requirement for mandatory inspection and maintenance after use. \\nc. The 30-second OEI power level is considered reached when one or more of the \\noperating limitations that apply to the 2-minute OEI power are exceeded. The 2-minute OEI power level is considered reached when one or more of the operating limitations that apply to the next lower OEI or engine rating are exceeded. \\nd. The rulemaking background for the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings is \\nprovided in Appendix 1. \\n2\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n    6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\n5. Guidance. \\na. Section 33.5 Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine . \\n(1) For rotorcraft engines having 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings, the \\napplicant must provide in the installation manuals the data on engine performance characteristics and variability required under § 33.5(b)(4). This data will enable the installer to meet the power availability requirements under §§ 27.45(f) and 29.45(f). The engine performance characteristics and variability should consider the power losses due to engine installation that can be defined at the engine level. For example, such installation losses should account for the effects of customer bleed and customer power extraction up to and including the highest rated power. \\n(2) Section 33.5(b)(4) requires that the engine be capable of obtaining and \\nsustaining the OEI rated power while operating within the associated operating limitations. The applicant should use the required engine data to establish a procedure for trending individual engine performance. This data should support maintenance procedures, intervals, and specifications that apply to the engine, its sensors, and indicating systems.  \\n(3) The data should also support procedures for detection of latent or dormant \\nfailure conditions of engine systems that may not be detectable through the recommended power assurance procedures or because the procedures do not include a topping check to the highest OEI rated power. For example, such latent or dormant conditions may involve the sensors and indicating systems of the fuel control maximum flow capability, measured turbine temperature, and speed limits. The applicant should analyze the dormant failures, which could lead to non-availability of the OEI rated power, and provide the results of this review for compliance with § 33.5(b)(4).  \\n(4) The applicant should validate the adequacy of the procedures, intervals, and \\nspecifications applied to maintaining the engine, its sensors, and indicating systems on the basis of the engine and the engine system’s failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). The engine data should include a thermodynamic model, and when applicable, should incorporate the experience gained during development and certification testing, as well as field experience gained with this engine type or engine of similar design.  \\n(5) The data required under § 33.5(b)(4) should enable the installer to establish the \\npower assurance procedures in which the extrapolation of power assurance results can be achieved from a lower power level to the highest OEI rated power. The performance extrapolation may be accomplished by comparing the performance characteristics with the minimum acceptable performance for the deteriorated engine. Establishing the minimum acceptable engine performance characteristics depends on the applicant’s \\nexperience with that engine and the size of its reliability database. For example:  \\n(a) In a mature engine program, the applicant may use the new production \\nengine acceptance test data, engine-to-engine variation, and also testing on engines prior \\n3\\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nto overhaul to determine the effects of deterioration. This program would maintain up-to-date minimum engine performance characteristics.  \\n(b) For a new engine design or a remote derivative of an existing design, it \\nmay be more difficult for an applicant to establish the initial database. The applicant, however, could use the experience gained from the engine’s development and certification tests. This experience usually includes several thousand hours of running time to schedules which are often far more rigorous than normal commercial service. The information gathered from these tests could provide a sufficient database for the assessment of in-service engines including the rate of deterioration. Testing engines in production will eventually establish engine-to-engine variation, but the applicant should assume initially an estimated worst variation based on similar experience with other engines. \\n(6) The applicant should also provide information on methods to ensure that \\nengine limiter settings will not prevent the engine from reaching 30-second or 2-minute OEI power. These engine limiter settings may include engine speed, measured gas temperature, fuel flow, and torque. \\nb. Section 33.7 Engine ratings and operating limitations. \\n(1) The 30-second and 2-minute OEI power ratings for rotorcraft engines are two \\nseparate ratings defined in § 1.1. These ratings are optional and the applicant may specifically request them from the available ratings under § 33.7. In the worst-case scenario identified in the test requirements, these ratings are associated in a combined structure of 2.5 minutes duration, composed of 30 seconds at the 30-second OEI rated power immediately followed by 2 minutes at the 2-minute OEI rated power.  \\n(2) These power ratings are intended for completing the flight after the failure or \\nshutdown of one engine in multi-engine rotorcraft during takeoff, climb, or landing. The 30-second OEI rated power provides a short burst of high power to conduct a continued or rejected takeoff, if an engine failure occurs at the critical decision point, so the rotorcraft can lift clear of any obstructions in the flight path and climb out or reject the takeoff. Similarly, this rated power provides adequate power for rotorcraft to carry out a safe landing or a balked landing if an engine  fails at any point up to and including the \\nlanding decision point. The 2-minute OEI ra ted power provides a further period of \\nincreased power for the rotorcraft to climb out from takeoff to a safe altitude and airspeed or to perform a balked landing. \\n(3) While the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings were originally conceived as \\nhigh power ratings using the available margins in the engine design and followed by a mandatory engine overhaul, experience has shown that the manufacturers provide engines that have different capabilities and use different amount of the margins. Therefore, some flexibility is possible in defining the mandatory maintenance actions, provided the applicant appropriately validates the actions during certification (see also paragraph 5.l. of this guidance). \\n4\\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n 6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\n(4) In some circumstances, the highest power used during a 2½ minute duration \\nevent might be lower than the 30-second OEI rating power band, but still within the 2\\xadminute OEI rating power band. In this case, the use of the 2-minute OEI rated power may be extended to 2½ minutes. However, the additional 30-second period is considered as usage of the 30-second OEI rating, and the mandatory inspection and maintenance actions prescribed for the 30-second OEI rating should be used. See paragraph 5.l.(1)(f) for additional guidance. \\n(5) If necessary, engine operating limitations associated with the use of the 30\\xad\\nsecond and 2-minute OEI power ratings may be established to mitigate engine failure or component deterioration observed during the applicable portion of the 2-hour supplementary test of § 33.87(f). Refer to pa ragraph 5.l.(1) of this AC for additional \\nguidance. \\n(6) Although the certification requirements have been defined around the worst-\\ncase scenario involving the possible use of these ratings three times in one flight, these ratings are intended for one usage per flight in an emergency during takeoff or landing. We recognize that the ratings may be inadvertently used in some unexpected, non-critical conditions, such as an engine failure in a rotorcraft flying at a high-speed cruise. In all cases, the required mandatory maintenance actions apply after any use of the OEI rating powers. \\nc. Section 33.27 Turbine, compressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotors . We \\napproved special conditions in accordance with § 21.14 for certain turboshaft engines having 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings. Applicants who seek approval of these ratings may either comply with the existing requirements, or request a special condition with appropriate justifications. See Appendix 2 for the technical content of previously issued special conditions amending § 33.27 that applies to the 30-second OEI and 2\\xadminute OEI ratings. \\nd. Section 33.28 Engine control systems. \\n(1) The automatic controls required by § 33.28(k) should be active when the 30\\xad\\nsecond OEI rated power is used and should prevent the engine from exceeding the operating limitations associated with the rating, except for the time duration discussed in paragraph 5.d.(2) below. These limitations are established under the requirements of § 33.7 and declared in the type certificate data sheet (TCDS). They may include parameters such as the output shaft torque or power, output shaft speed, gas producer speed, and gas path temperature. Exceeding these limits could result in engine failure since the engine operation at 30-second OEI rate d power could have already used most or \\nall available margins in the engine design. An engine failure would be unacceptable in this OEI flight configuration when one engine has already failed. The automatic control \\nof the 30-second OEI rated power is intended to free the pilot from monitoring the associated engine parameters and ensure they remain within their limits. This is because the pilot may need to operate in a high workload environment and perform simultaneous \\n5\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nactions to maintain a safe flight during the use of 30-second OEI rating. \\n(2) The applicant’s design should not limit the time duration at which the 30\\xad\\nsecond OEI power is used. This allows the pilot to exceed the time limit if needed to safely land the rotorcraft in an emergency as permitted by § 91.3(b).  \\n(3) When, instead of the means, the applicant provides the provision for a means \\nfor automatic controls, the installation manuals should declare all necessary information for the installer to develop the automatic controls system. The means, or the provision for a means, for the automatic control of the engine within its operating limitations should be effective whether the engine operation is considered normal or abnormal. \\n(4) The required means or the provision for a means for automatic control should \\nnot prevent the engine from reaching and maintaining its 30-second OEI rated power. \\ne. Section 33.29 Instrument connection . \\n(1) For compliance with § 33.29(c), the 30-second OEI power level is considered \\nreached when one or more of the operating limitations that apply to the 2-minute OEI power is exceeded. The 2-minute OEI power level is considered reached when one or more of the operating limitations that apply to the next lower OEI or engine rating are exceeded. \\n(2) The applicant must provide either a means or a provision for a means to \\ncomply with the requirements of § 33.29(c)(1) through (c)(4). For example, the applicant may satisfy “a means” by providing a recorder to record the entry into the OEI power bands. Alternatively, the applicant may fulfill “a provision for a means” by specifying that the installer provide a recorder to record entry into the OEI power bands. The applicant may find that a “provision for a means” is more suitable to satisfy the pilot alert requirement when a portion of the pilot alert system is certified with the rotorcraft. In this case, the applicant should identify this provision in the installation manual, enabling the installer to develop the required pilot alert system.  \\n(3) The automatic recording of data required under § 33.29(c)(2) should provide \\nthe information needed to conduct the mandatory inspection and prescribed maintenance per Appendix A33.4. At a minimum, it should record each rating’s occurrences per flight; the duration for each occurrence or accumulated time; and any exceedence of the operating limitations or time limits associated with each OEI rating. See paragraph 5.b.(4) for guidance when the 2-minute time limit at 2-minute OEI rated power is exceeded. \\n(4) The applicant should ensure the overall development assurance level of the \\nrecording and retrieval system is consistent with its classification of at least hazardous based on failure condition classifications de fined in SAE ARP4754; see reference in \\nparagraph 3.f. The development assurance level(s) for the components of systems that record the 2-minute and 30-second OEI power usages and retrieve the recorded data \\n6\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n 6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nshould be based on the criticality of the function(s) performed within the recording and \\nretrieval system as determined by a system safety assessment (SSA). The overall system assurance level can be achieved based on an appropriate combination of system architecture and component assurance levels. The objectives are to ensure the information needed for the mandatory maintenance is available after the use of OEI powers and to avoid continued operation of the engine in a potentially unsafe condition. \\n(5) If the recording or retrieval system is not part of the engine, the applicant must \\nspecify in the installation instructions its required failure condition classification, system design features, and interface requirements (e.g., reliability, development assurance level, software level, lightning, and high energy radiated frequency). If software is used for data recording and retrieval, the specifications must comply with the requirements of § 33.28(g). \\n(6) The recording system should be designed so that only the maintenance \\npersonnel can reset it. This should prevent further engine operation without completion of the mandatory post-flight inspection and maintenance actions. \\nf. Section 33.70 Engine life-limited parts . For rotorcraft engines for which the 30\\xad\\nsecond OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings are desired, the applicant should provide a method to account for low cycle fatigue effects from the use of the two OEI ratings on engine life-limited parts. This may be done by adding to the expended lives of components a finite number of cycles associated with th e use of each of the two OEI power ratings. \\nAlternatively, life reduction factor(s) associat ed with the use of each OEI power ratings \\nmay be applied to the lives of these components. Applicants with engines that were certified to § 33.14, which was removed by Amendment No. 33-22, should follow the guidance in this paragraph when applying for OEI ratings. \\ng. Section 33.83 Vibration test . Section 33.83(b) prescribes the required ranges of \\npower and both the physical and corrected rotational speeds for vibration survey. For the 2-minute OEI rating, the test speed should be from the minimum rotational speed up to 103 percent of the maximum physical and corrected rotational speed permitted for the rating. For the 30-second OEI rating, the test speed should be from the minimum rotational speed up to 100 percent of the maximum physical and corrected rotational speed permitted for the rating. All other § 33.83(b) requirements apply to both OEI ratings. \\nh. Section 33.85 Calibration tests . \\n(1) Engines having 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings are not required to \\nperform calibration tests, but compliance with the requirements of § 33.85 must be satisfied based on the measurements taken during the endurance test, as specified under § 33.85(d). This is to minimize the damage to the engine and its hardware during the certification program, while taking full advantage of the data obtained during the endurance test. \\n7\\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\n(2) The data acquired during testing in compliance with the requirements of \\n§§ 33.87(f), 33.88, and 33.90 should also be used to establish the engine characteristics throughout the engine’s operating envelope. In particular, the rated power for the 30\\xadsecond and 2-minute OEI ratings must reflect the power deterioration observed from the test calibration prior to the endurance test of § 33.87(f) up to and including the third application of 30-second rated power. The power deterioration through the third application should be the best indicator of the worst-case power deterioration that could occur during actual use of the rating. The applicant should, therefore, include this information on power deterioration in the data given to the engine installer to enable them to define the rotorcraft performance characteristics. If power deterioration exceeds 10 percent at the 30-second rating over the course of the 2-hour test, the applicant must evaluate the mode of deterioration to ensure that the availability of 30-second rated power in service will not be compromised by deterioration variability.  \\ni. Section 33.87 Endurance Test. \\n(1) For rotorcraft engines for which 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings are \\ndesired, the applicant must conduct a 2-hour supplementary test as required under § 33.87(f), in addition to the basic 150-hour endurance test. We recommend the applicant disassemble the tested engine and inspect the engine components at the conclusion of the 150-hour test, but prior to the supplementary test, using the criteria specified in § 33.93(a). In this case, the applicant must reassemble the engine using the same parts that completed the 150-hour endurance test, except for those defined as consumable. The applicant must then perform the supplementary test required in § 33.87(f) followed by a second teardown inspection of the engine using the criteria specified in § 33.93(b). The level of component cleaning to facilitate inspection prior to rebuild for the test in § 33.87(f) must be acceptable to the FAA. The applicant must show that any cleaning during the teardown inspection, or replacement of consumable parts, will not enhance the engine’s ability to meet § 33.93(b) requirements of the additional endurance test. \\nNote: If the applicant elects not to disassemble and inspect the engine prior to starting the supplementary test in § 33.87(f), then the teardown inspection requirements of § 33.93(a) apply on completion of the test; see § 33.93(c).  \\n(2) The applicant must run four test sequences continuously for the required 2\\xad\\nhour test duration without stoppage. In the event of a stoppage, the interrupted sequence \\nneeds to be repeated in full or the sequence can be restarted from the interrupt point if there are technical justifications acceptable to  the FAA. If it is determined that the \\nsequence need not be repeated in its entirety, the test should be re-started from a point where the engine thermal condition would be the same as at the time of interruption. If an excessive number of interruptions occur, the applicant should repeat the entire test. In changing the power setting at the beginning and the end of each test sequence, the power control lever should be moved from one position to the other in not more than one second. \\n(3) To reduce test complexity, and to improve flexibility needed to attain the key \\n8\\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nparameters (speed, temperature and torque) during the test in § 33.87(f), maximum air bleed for engine and aircraft services under § 33.87(a)(5) need not be used if the applicant can show by test, or analysis based on testing, that the engine’s ability to meet the teardown inspection requirements of § 33.93 is not enhanced. The analysis should include (1) the effect of the bleed air extraction to the engine secondary air system which provides cooling air to various engine components; and (2) the thermodynamic cycle effects of bleed (for example, core speed to output shaft speed changes). \\n(4) If, during testing, the accessory drives and mounting attachments are not \\nloaded, the equivalent power must be added (see § 33.87(a)(6)) to the required power at the output drive so that the power turbine rotor assembly is operated at or above the same levels it would be if the accessory drives and mounting attachments were loaded. \\n(5) The engine operating limitations of 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings must \\nbe based on the minimum values obtained during the applications of the 2-hour test of § 33.87(f) and must be identified in the TCDS. Due allowance should be made for stabilization time and the limits of accuracy for the instrumentation or automatic controlling system declared in accordance with §§ 33.29(c) and 33.28(k). \\n(6) The power level of test condition § 33.87 (f)(4) is intended to demonstrate the \\nhighest en route, OEI, or non-OEI power. \\nj. Section 33.88 Engine overtemperature test. \\n(1) For the purpose of the test required under § 33.88(b), the maximum power-on \\nr.p.m. is the steady state rotor speed associated with the 30-second OEI rating. However, if the transient speed stabilization to steady state exceeds 3 seconds, then the higher transient rotor speed achieved during the transition to 30-second OEI power should be used instead. \\n(2) The gas temperature increase of 35 degrees F for conducting the test per \\n§ 33.88 (b) is based on the turbine inlet gas temperature at the location immediately in front of the first stage high pressure turbine rotor; see reference in paragraph 3.g. \\n(3) After the overtemperature test, the turbine assembly may show distress beyond \\nserviceable limits provided that no burst, blade failure, or other significant failure of any engine component would occur, or become evident, during the test, shutdown, or subsequent teardown inspection. If a potential failure becomes evident, the applicant should analyze the failure and establish by analysis or test that the cause would not prevent the OEI rating power from being satisfactorily achieved in service. \\nk. Section 33.93 Teardown inspection . \\n(1) After the endurance test of § 33.87(f), the applicant should show that no failure \\nof any significant engine component is evident during the test, shutdown, or subsequent teardown inspection. If a failure is evident, the applicant should analyze the failure and \\n9\\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n   6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nestablish by test or analysis, or both, that the cause is corrected, or certain limitations are imposed to the engine as appropriate. For this section, the engine parts that are deemed significant are those that affect structural integrity, including, but not limited to mounts, cases, bearing supports, shafts, and rotors. \\n(2) For components that are distressed beyond serviceable limits by this test, the \\napplicant must show that the inspections and mandatory maintenance actions for these components specified in the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) are adequate for maintaining continued airworthiness. The instructions should include means for proper identification of the structural and functional condition of these components and the appropriate maintenance actions. The applicant should identify component deterioration during the test and the effects on the engine performance. The component distress seen as a result of the test in § 33.87(f) should not indicate any potentially hazardous condition. The visible and non-visible physical damage should be identified and assessed, including the effects of creep, stre ss rupture, metallurgical effects, and life \\nusage. The results of such evaluation should then be considered when defining and justifying the inspections and mandatory maintenance actions for the ICA. \\nl. Section 33.4 Instructions for Continued Airworthiness and Appendix A33.4 \\nAirworthiness Limitations Section . \\n(1) Inspection and maintenance requirements for rotorcraft engines with 30\\xad\\nsecond and 2-minute OEI power ratings. \\n(a) For rotorcraft engines with 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings, the \\nAirworthiness Limitations Section (ALS) of  the ICA is required to prescribe the \\nmandatory post-flight inspection and maintenance actions following the use of either, or both, of these two ratings, regardless of the frequency, and prior to next flight. The ALS should also include the definition of data to be provided by the operator to support the applicant in completing the engine in service evaluation program (see paragraph 5.l.(3)). \\n(b) The applicant should determine the mandatory post-flight inspection and \\nmaintenance actions based on findings during certification tests, such as the endurance, overspeed, overtemperature, and maintenance tests. The applicant may also use data and information acquired during engine development tests or service experience with engines of the same or similar design. The inspection and maintenance actions required under A33.4(b)(1) should account for component deterioration and damage to ensure they are properly identified during the post-flight inspection and that adequate repairs, maintenance, or component replacement actions are prescribed. The adequacy of these inspections and maintenance actions must be validated as required under A33.4(b)(2) and their continued adequacy must be established based on an in-service program required under A33.4(b)(3). The mandatory inspection and maintenance actions may be modified after the engine enters service, based on its service experience. \\n(c) To ensure the engine is maintained in a condition so that the 30-second and \\n2-minute OEI rating powers can be attained and sustained, the power assurance \\n10\\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nprocedures and instructions for continued airworthiness should include the following: \\n1  Recording parameters and times in maintenance records 2 Visual inspection(s) and results \\n3 Power assurance/trend check \\n4  Reduction in time to overhaul or component change 5 Addition of special inspection and intervals \\n6 Module change/overhaul \\n7  Engine removal/overhaul; and  8  Other maintenance details regarding servicing points, inspections, \\nadjustments, tests, and replacement of components if required.  \\n(d) The 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings are intended to safely use the \\navailable engine design margins for brief periods of exposure with component deterioration permitted beyond serviceable limits and not available for further use. The extent of component damage or life reduction depends on the severity and duration of the operating conditions associated with the use of these ratings, the engine design margins, and prior hardware condition. \\n(e) Because the use of these ratings requires that engine operation conditions \\nand time durations be recorded, the prescribed inspection and maintenance actions may be directly related to the actual documented usage level, time, and, if applicable, to a known condition prior to the rating(s) usage (for example, hours/cycles/prior rating exposure). Depending on the actual operating parameters, such as temperature and time exposure recorded during the use of these ratings in accordance with § 33.29, it is possible to predefine a maintenance action that reduces the remaining time interval to the overhaul or component replacement. If the inspection mandated for the use of these ratings results in no further maintenance, then the minimum requirement would be the interpretation of recorded event data and documentation of the data in the maintenance log(s). \\n(f) When usage of 2-minute OEI rating is extended to 2½ minutes, the \\nadditional 30-second period is considered as usage of the 30-second OEI rating, and the inspection and maintenance actions prescribed for the 30-second OEI rating should be used. Alternately, for the extended use of the 2-minute OEI power rating to 2½-minute \\nduration, the applicant may seek approval for different inspection and maintenance actions, also subject to the requirements of A33.4(b)(2) and (b)(3). The substantiation and validation of these actions may be based on similar engines having an approved  2½-minute OEI power rating. The applicant must show that the extended use of the 2\\xadminute OEI power rating to 2½-minutes is equivalent to the 2½-minute OEI power rating approved for the other engine. If the applicant records only the accumulated usage time under § 33.29(c)(2), then the inspection and maintenance actions must be based on the total recorded time duration regardless of the number of application at the ratings used in one flight. \\n(2) Validation of mandatory post-flight inspection and maintenance. \\n11\\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\n(a) The mandatory inspection and maintenance following the use of 30-second \\nor 2-minute OEI ratings should identify and correct any component distress that could \\nsignificantly reduce subsequent engine reliability or prevent the engine from achieving or \\nsustaining further application of the OEI ratings. The applicant should provide evidence by endurance test results, analysis based on test data of the endurance tests, and/or certification tests and service experience of similar engine types and designs to show that power at 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings is achievable and can be sustained for the respective duration during the intervals between overhauls or major maintenance of the engine. \\n(b) The certification procedures for 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings \\ndemonstrate the design adequacy by endurance testing and by specific margin tests for turbine temperature and rotor speeds. Essential to establishing mandatory inspection and maintenance instructions is a thorough knowledge of the potential damage incurred with use of the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings. The applicant should demonstrate a good understanding of the engine operating margins to various failure modes when using the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings. These failure modes and margins should be determined and validated by appropriate methods or experience. These may include but are not limited to: \\n1 Design analytical predictions \\n2  Service experience of identical or similar design 3 Test or service failure experience \\n4  Results of OEI certification tests 5  Dedicated engine and component tests; and 6 FMEA predictions. \\n(c) Understanding of failure modes may come from service experience in \\nwhich hardware distress or failure was caused by exceeding an operating limitation associated with the rating. Alternatively, either component or engine level exceedence testing could be useful in evaluating failure mode margins, indications, power decay characteristics and severity. Existing methods to establishing failure margins are specific to a certain engine design and experience and, therefore, vary greatly between engine types. One test method that illustrates the objective of assessing the failure margin(s) from the 30-second OEI power rating condition is to progressively increase engine fuel flow until either an abrupt failure occurs or power begins to decay due to component degradation. Results of such a test could establish margins to and consequences of component failure. This could be useful in establishing appropriate maintenance instructions. Potential failure modes are design dependent, however, most are related to excessive turbine temperature or engine overtorque. Some potential failure modes could include but are not limited to: \\n1 Blade stress rupture \\n2 Vane distortion/area change \\n3 Case distortion \\n12\\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\n4 Disc, spacer, or seal growth/rub \\n5 Creep \\n6  Incipient melting \\n7 Rub induced HCF; and \\n8 Blade release. \\n(d) The applicant should provide mandatory inspection procedures that can \\nreliably ascertain component distress and continued airworthiness; define life reduction; or require certain component replacement, repair, or overhaul. An applicant that has an extensive service history with derivative engines can combine that experience with OEI test results and failure mode/margin knowledge to establish the maintenance requirements with a high degree of confidence. A new type design may have to rely on design/FMEA predictions, development/certification/flight tests, and dedicated failure mode test experience to form the basis for establishing OEI usage maintenance requirements. These initial requirements could be altered later based on documented service experience and or additional development tests. \\n(3) Program to Validate Continued Airworthiness Instructions and Power \\nAvailability. \\n(a) The in-service engine evaluation program required under A33.4(b)(3) \\nensures the continued adequacy of the airworthiness instructions and power availability. To achieve this goal, the applicant should collect data related to the condition of engine hardware and power availability at various stages in the life of the engine. The applicant should verify that the data satisfactorily compares with that used to define the mandatory post-flight inspection and maintenance actions at the time of engine certification. When comparing data from the in-service engines that experienced the use of 30-second and 2\\xadminute OEI ratings with data from the certification engine following the 2-hour endurance test required under section 33.87(f), the applicant may find differences in hardware condition and power assurance characteristics. The applicant must ensure that any of these differences are properly addressed and accounted for by the mandatory inspection and maintenance actions required under this section. Otherwise, these differences, the in-service engine data, or any other supplementary data obtained by additional engine test, should be used to modify the mandatory instructions.   \\n(b) The applicant should identify in the ALS the type of data and the \\nprocedures to collect and return the information necessary for the in-service evaluation program. To decide what data should be collected, the applicant should consider the following: \\n1  Whether the engine is a new type design, a derivative, or a derivative of \\na previously certified engine with 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings. \\n2  The applicable service experience with identical or similar engine \\ndesigns. \\n3  The certification and development test results indicating whether the \\nOEI ratings are aggressive or conservative, or whether the use of the ratings causes \\n13\\n\\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n \\n   \\n 6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nadditional distress or no distress to the engine hardware. \\n4  Knowledge of failure modes and margins to failure. \\n(c) The in-service engine evaluation program must include some type of \\nservice engine testing and/or evaluations of  service usage of the 30-second and 2-minute \\nratings, although equivalent service engine test experience on engines of similar design is \\nacceptable as an alternative. This part of the program would consist of, but not be limited to, one or more of the following elements: \\n1 Scheduled tests of in-service engines consisting of three applications of \\nthe 30-second OEI rated power, while either installed in the rotorcraft or in an engine test cell. The engines should be selected to have sufficient service time to meet the goal described in paragraph 5.l.(3)(a) above. The program should specify the test frequency \\nand the number of engines to be tested, as well as test parameters, necessary inspections, and data to be recorded. At a minimum, the recorded data should relate to the available power, power assurance validation, and hardware condition before and after the 30\\xadsecond and 2-minute OEI rating usage. \\n2 Unscheduled opportunity tests of engines consisting of three applications \\nof the 30-second OEI rated power. The program may include actions to be taken when engines become available that meet certain predetermined criteria. Definition of selection criteria for representative aged engines should be included in the program. Inspection/test requirements on such engines should include the recording of data related to available power and the identification of the hardware condition before and after the 30-second and 2-minute OEI rating usage. \\n3  Service usage of 30-second and 2-minute OEI rated power. This may \\ninclude recorded (in service) power available data, power available data determined after the use of 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings, and results of the mandatory inspection and maintenance actions. \\n4  Tests of in-service engines of similar design are also acceptable, \\nproviding they are shown to be equivalent or representative. \\n(d) The number of the in-service engines tested may be reduced if justified by \\nthe data obtained during the engine development or certification tests. Engine data obtained during the rotorcraft certification testing of the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings may be also used when it applies to engine available power and the hardware condition. Although the number of engines tested may be reduced based on certification data, the in-service engine tests under this program cannot be eliminated.  \\n(e) During the execution of the in-service engine evaluation program, the \\napplicant should modify the continuing airworthiness instructions as needed based on the results obtained. Similarly, if circumstances warrant, the program may need to be modified as additional in-service data becomes available. \\n14\\n \\n \\n  \\n 6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\n//signed by Peter A.

RULEMAKING BACKGROUND ON 30-SECOND OEI AND 2\\xad\\nMINUTE OEI RATINGS \\n1. The Aerospace Industries Association of America, Inc., (AIA) submitted a petition for \\nrulemaking to the FAA on September 20, 1984, requesting an amendment to part 33 to permit type certification of engines and rotorcraft with new 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings. \\n2. As a result of the AIA petition, the FAA issued Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \\n(NPRM) No. 89-27 and Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM) No. 89\\xad27A, published in the Federal Register on September 22, 1989 (54 FR 39080) and February 7, 1995 (60 FR 7380), respectively. The NPRM proposed definitions and type certification standards for 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings at higher power levels than those currently available. In response to several comments, the FAA issued the SNPRM, which proposed modified definitions to 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings and minor wording changes to §§ 33.29, 33.67, and 33.85. The SNPRM also proposed a second overspeed test requirement in § 33.27 for 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings. \\n3. The final rule (Amendment 33-18) was published in the Federal Register on June 19, \\n1996 (61 FR 31324). In the final rule, the FAA adopted the proposed new definitions of 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI power ratings. The FAA also revised requirements related to OEI ratings in §§ 33.7, 33.29, 33.67, 33.85, 33.87, 33.88, and 33.93. The proposed change to § 33.27 was not adopted because the FAA determined that certain technical aspects had not been resolved and were still under discussion with the Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee harmonization working group. The FAA indicated in the final rule that the overspeed test requirements for the ratings would be addressed on a case-by-case basis for each application for type certification that requests 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings. Four special conditions that addressed overspeed test requirements for 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings for certain specific engine models were issued between 1993 and 2006. \\n4. A working group composed of representatives of the FAA, the Joint Aviation \\nAuthorities (JAA), Transport Canada, and industry recommended a set of harmonized certification requirements for parts 1 and 33 applicable to the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) subsequently adopted these new requirements as part of its Certifica tion Specifications for Engines. The proposed \\nrevisions to the certification standards for § 1.1 and §§ 33.5, 33.29, 33.67, 33.87, 33.88, 33.93, and Appendix A33.4 were published on May 4, 2007 in the Federal Register (72 FR 25207). The final rule was subsequently published as Amendment No. 33-25 on August 18, 2008 in the Federal Register (73 FR 48119), effective October 17, 2008. This rule harmonizes FAA type certification standards for these ratings with the requirements of EASA in the Certification Specifications for Engines and with proposed requirements for Transport Canada Civil Aviation, thus simplifying airworthiness approvals for import and export. Subsequently, Amendment No. 33-26, which was published on August 19, \\n16\\n \\n \\n     \\n 6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nAppendix 1 \\n2008, updated the requirements in § 33.28 for engine control systems and moved the \\nrequirements of 33.67(d) to 33.28(k).  \\n17\\n \\n                \\n                \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n 6/11/09 AC 33-7A \\nAppendix 2 \\nAPPENDIX 2. EXAMPLE OF SPECIAL CONDITIONS FOR OVERSPEED TEST \\nREQUIREMENTS OF § 33.27 \\n1. The following is an example of the technical content of special conditions to \\n§ 33.27(b) for the 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings. For engines with 30-second \\nand 2-minute OEI ratings, in addition to the requirements of § 33.27(b), turbine and compressor rotors should have sufficient strength to withstand the conditions specified in one of the following tests for the most critically stressed rotor component of each turbine and compressor, including integral drum rotors and centrifugal compressor, as determined by analysis or other acceptable means. We recommend selecting the test from the following paragraphs (a or b), as determined by the speed defined in paragraph a(2) or b(2), whichever is higher. \\na. Test for a period of two and one-half minutes— \\n(1) At its maximum operating temperature except as provided in § 33.27(c)(2)(iv); \\nand \\n(2) At the highest speed determined, in accordance with § 33.27(c)(2)(i) through \\n(iv). \\n(3) This test may be performed using a separate test vehicle as desired. \\nb. Test for a period of 5 minutes— \\n(1) At its maximum operating temperature except as provided in § 33.27(c)(2)(iv); \\nand \\n(2) At 100 percent of the highest speed that would result from failure of the most \\ncritical component of each turbine and compressor or system in a representative installation of the engine when operating at 30-second and 2-minute OEI rating conditions; and \\n(3) The test speed must take into account minimum material properties, maximum \\noperating temperature, and the most adverse dimensional tolerances. \\n(4) This test may be performed using a separate test vehicle as desired. \\nFollowing the test, rotor growth and distress beyond dimensional limits for an overspeed condition is permitted for 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings only, provided the structural integrity of the rotor is maintained, as shown by a procedure acceptable to the FAA. \\n18\\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n Advisory\\nU.S. Department \\nof Transportation CircularFederal Aviation \\nAdministration  \\nSubject : Comparative Method to Show Date : 9/8/09 AC No: 33.83-1 \\nEquivalent Vibratory Stresses and High Cycle Initiated by: ANE-110 \\nFatigue Capability for Parts Manufacturer \\nApproval of Turbine Engine and Auxiliary Power Unit Parts \\n1. Purpose. This advisory circular (AC)  describes a comparative test and analysis method that \\nmay be used for turbine engine or auxiliary power unit (APU) blades or vanes when produced \\nunder parts manufacturer approval (PMA). PMA applicants may use this comparative modal and \\nhigh-cycle fatigue (HCF) method to show the vi bratory stresses and HCF capability of their \\nproposed blades or vanes are equi valent to those of the type de sign parts. This method supports \\nshowing that the engine or APU still complies with  part 33 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal \\nRegulations (14 CFR part 33) or T echnical Standard Order (TSO) C77. \\n2. Applicability. \\na. This guidance is for applicants reques ting PMA approval of turbine engine and APU \\nblades and vanes, with the exception of fan blad es and fan outlet guide vanes. This AC does not \\napply to integrally bladed disks (axial and centr ifugal), rotor discs, spa cers, or rotor shafts. \\nApplicants may use this guidance if the material , mass, and geometric characteristics of their \\nblades or vanes are at leas t equal to those of the type design blades or vanes.  \\nb. Applicants can use this method when requesting PMA under test and computation, per \\n14 CFR part 21, and when using the comparative test and analysis  approach described in Order \\n8110.42, Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures. \\nc. This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature a nd does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes acceptable means, but no t the only means, for showing compliance with \\nthe applicable engine or APU re quirements using the comparative te st and analysis approach for \\nPMA under test and computations. The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating \\ncompliance that an applicant may elect to presen t. Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and \\n“must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of \\ncompliance. While these guidelines are not manda tory, they are derived from FAA and industry \\nexperience in determining compliance with the re levant regulations. On the other hand, if we \\nbecome convinced that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\nregulations, we will not be bound by the terms of  this AC, and we may require additional \\nsubstantiation as the basis for finding compliance.  \\nd. This document does not cha nge, create any additional, au thorize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from, existing regulatory requirements. \\n3. Related References.

A blade or vane of a tu rbine engine or an APU. \\nb. Fatigue strength. The alternating stress that can be sustained by a part for a given \\nnumber of cycles. This material property is temperature dependent. \\nc. Modal characteristics . Natural frequencies and mode shapes.  \\nd. Normal mode shape . A characteristic deflection shap e associated with each natural \\nfrequency. Also referred to as “mode shape.” \\ne. Natural frequency . The frequency at which a part vibrates after being excited by an \\nimpulse (i.e., a single hammer blow). Parts typi cally have many natural frequencies that are a \\nfunction of the part\\'s mass and stiffness distribu tion as well as the means by which the part is \\nrestrained. The source and type  of excitation will determine which natural frequency, or \\nfrequencies, is excited. \\nf. Representative engine operating condition . The engine operating at rated take-off power \\nor thrust, at the sea level, hot da y, flat rated, corner point condition.  \\n2 \\n\\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\ng. Resonance . The condition that occurs when the exciting force frequency coincides with \\none of the component\\'s natural frequencies resu lting in an increase in vibratory amplitude. A \\nunique vibratory mode exists for each resonant response. \\nh. Run-out . A fatigue test that completes the planned test durati on (cycles) without \\ncracking. \\n5. Background. \\na. During the past several years, the F AA has evaluated numerous proposals from PMA \\napplicants for comparative testing of compresso r and turbine blades and vanes and provided \\nguidance based on the details of each project. Applicants performed these tests to verify the \\nvibratory and HCF design characteristics for their proposed PMA bl ades or vanes were at least \\nequal to those of the type design parts. The te sts were needed because comparing the geometry \\nand material of the proposed PMA blade or va ne with the corresponding type design part was \\ninsufficient to show equivale nt vibratory stresses and HCF capability between the parts. \\nb. Due to the increase in complex PMA test proposals, we are providing this guidance to \\nassist applicants to demonstrate equivalent vibratory stresses and HCF capability for their \\nproposed PMA parts. This guidance outlines a co mparative modal and HCF test and analysis \\nmethod for PMA blades and vanes, with the exceptions identified in paragraph 2.a.  \\n6. Prerequisites to Modal and Fatigue Te sting – Geometry, Mass, and Material \\nCharacteristics.   Applicants can use the method descri bed in this guidance only after showing \\nthat the blade’s geometry, mass, and material charac teristics are at least equal to those of the type \\ndesign part. This is because the comparative test  method is based on limited verification of the \\nPMA part design. Verification is li mited to bench testing at zero r.p.m. for modal testing and to a \\nsingle mode for HCF testing. Prio r to FAA approval to conduct this testing, applicants must \\ncompare and document the equivalency of the PM A and type design blades. Applicants must \\nalso identify and discuss with the FAA any diffe rences for the blade characteristics identified \\nbelow. \\na. Geometry . The geometric characteristics of the PMA blade should fall within the \\nmeasured geometric characteristics of the type design blade. Geometric characteristics include: \\n• External and internal dimensions  and dimensional tolerances; and \\n• Internal blade cooling design, including di mensions and air flow characteristics. \\n3 \\n\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\nb. Mass . The mass characteristics of the PMA blade should fall within the measured \\ncharacteristics of the type design blade. Mass characteristics include: \\n• Blade weight and cente r of gravity; and  \\n• Moment weights for large or complex blade airfoil shapes. \\nc. Material . Applicants must show that the material characteristics of the PMA blade are \\nat least equal to the type desi gn blade based on an assessment of the type design part not on a \\ngeneric specification or a PMA holder’s intern al specification. The material characteristics \\nestablished for the PMA blade design must account for the PMA finished part manufacturing \\nprocesses. Material characteristics of the blades consist of the following properties: \\n(1) Metallurgical properties include chemi cal composition, material form (for example, \\ncasting, forging, and bar stock) and micro-structure (for example,  grain size, shape, texture, \\norientation and distribution). \\n(2) Physical properties in clude density, coefficient of thermal expansion, coefficient of \\nthermal conductivity, specific heat, Young’s mo dulus, shear modulus, and Poisson’s ratio. \\nProperties such as Young’s modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson’s ratio should be tested and \\ncompared at room temperature and at a metal temperature consistent with the representative engine operating condition. \\n(3) Mechanical properties include hardness,  tensile, and creep. These properties should \\nbe measured at a metal temperature consiste nt with the representative engine operating \\ncondition. \\n7. Compliance with § 33.83 Requirements. \\na. Certification of the original type design of an engine to § 33.83 is based on an \\ninstrumented engine test (vibration survey) whic h requires measurement of vibratory stresses of \\nengine parts. These vibratory st resses when combined with th e appropriate steady stresses are \\nused to demonstrate suitable margins relative to th e endurance limit (fatigue  strength) of the \\nmaterials (refer to § 33.83(d)). These vibrator y stresses are measured based on the engine \\noperating throughout the declared fl ight envelope and for a range of rotational speeds (refer to \\n§ 33.83(b)). Using this comparativ e test and analysis approac h, the PMA blade should have \\nvibratory and steady stresses, as well as ultimate and fatigue stre ngth, equivalent to the type \\ndesign blade. \\nb. The blade vibratory stresses that result from  the engine internal excitation forces (i.e., \\ngas path, mechanical component, or other dynamic interactions) ar e expected to be equivalent \\nwhen the blade modal characteristics (natural  frequencies and mode shapes) and damping \\ncharacteristics are equivalent and the conditions in paragraph 6 above are met. The method to \\nshow modal characteristics, i.e., natural frequenc ies and mode shapes, are equivalent is discussed \\nin paragraph 8. \\n4 \\n\\n    \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\n(1) Natural frequencies must be equivale nt to ensure the rotor speed at which each \\nnatural frequency responds is preserved. In addition, the type design statistical frequency \\ndistribution for each normal mode must also be pr eserved to ensure the dynamic response of the \\nrotor system, as well as responses of the individual blades, do es not increase.  \\n(2) Mode shapes must be equivalent to pr eserve the blade’s vibratory stress distribution \\nand to ensure the blade vibratory response to th e airflow and other sources of excitation is \\nequivalent. \\n(3) Damping characteristics must be equivale nt to preserve the bl ade’s vibratory stress \\nresponse to the excitation forces in the engine. \\n(a) Aerodynamic damping is expected to  be equivalent when the applicant shows \\nthe blade modal characteris tics are equivalent.   \\n(b) Mechanical damping is expected to be equivalent when blade mechanical \\ninterfaces (root and shroud designs) are shown to be equivalent. Applicants must identify the \\nblade geometrical and manufacturing characterist ics, which should have been documented under \\nparagraph 6, that may affect blade damping and show  these are at least equa l to those of the type \\ndesign blade. These attributes include certain blad e geometrical and material characteristics, such \\nas blade attachment, shroud, damper interface di mensions and tolerances, hardness, and surface \\nfinish. \\nc. The blade steady stresses are expected to be equivalent when certain blade geometrical \\nand material characteristics are shown to be equivalent. Applicants must identify the blade geometrical and material characteristics, which should have been documented per paragraph 6, \\nthat may affect blade steady stresse s and show these are equivalent. \\nd. The blade ultimate strength and fatigue st rength must be equiva lent to support the \\napplicant’s showing that the PMA bl ade vibratory stress margin is at least equal to that of the \\ntype design. \\n(1) The ultimate strength is expected to be equivalent when the applicant shows the \\nminimum (minus three (-3) standard deviations) material ultimate strength of the proposed PMA \\nblade is at least equal with that of the type design blade. The ultimate strength data must be \\ndeveloped for a metal temperature at the representative engine operating condition. \\n(2) The method to show equivalent blade fa tigue strength is discussed in paragraph 9. \\n8. Comparative Method for Assessing Modal Characteristics.  This paragraph outlines a \\ncomparative method applicants may use to show  that a PMA blade ha s vibratory stresses \\nequivalent to a type design blade. Using this method, applicants should conduct a laboratory test \\nprogram to acquire and compare the modal char acteristics—natural frequencies and normal \\nmode shapes—of the PMA and type design bl ades. The natural frequencies and their \\ncorresponding mode shapes are unique to each blade;  therefore, the objective of this test is to \\nassess whether blades produced to the PMA geom etric design tolerances preserve the modal \\n5 \\n\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\ncharacteristics of the type design blade. The following paragraphs address test planning and \\npreparation, measurement and comparison of natural frequencies, and measurement and \\ncomparison of mode shapes.\\n a. Pre-test Planning . Prior to conducting certification test s, applicants shou ld analyze their \\nPMA blade design (nominal geometry from meas urement of type design blades) to: gain an \\nunderstanding of its fundament al modal characteris tics; identify an appropriate test \\nconfiguration; determine the numbe r of modes to be tested; establish measurements to be made; \\nand identify the minimum number of specimens to be tested.   \\n(1) Analysis. Prior to testing, applicants should conduct a finite element analysis \\n(FEA) of the PMA blade to clearly identify the expected natural frequencies and mode shapes. \\nThis ensures that laboratory testing will cover all the natural frequencies within the engine \\noperating range; appropriate excitation and respon se measurement methods are selected; and the \\ntest data are not corrupted by modal interacti on with the test setup (e.g., the fixture). The \\nanalytical model should be correlated with the initial experimental test results to ensure both the \\nanalytical predictions and the te st results agree before the remaining tests are initiated.\\n (2) Test Setup. \\n(a) Temperature.  The modal testing ma y be performed at room temperature if the \\napplicant has met the conditions of paragraph 6, i. e., shown that the material physical properties \\nof the PMA blade are at least equal to those of  the type design blad e, or reconciled any \\ndifferences with the FAA. \\n(b) Boundary conditions.  The natural frequencies and associated mode shapes \\nshould be determined using the same boundary conditions. The applicant should conduct modal testing with the blade attachment fixed and th e tip free, unless an al ternate set of boundary \\nconditions can be justified. The applicant shoul d use the finite element model identified in \\nparagraph 8.a.(1) to justify th e alternate set of boundary conditions. The fixed blade attachment \\nshould only constrain the dovetail/firtree not the blade platform, unless the applicant demonstrates that the blade platform is locked during normal engine operation. \\n(c) Modal test excitation method.  Excitation may be by shaker, acoustic horn, or \\nother means, provided that the ex citation is readily controlled and provides repeatable input. The \\nexcitation method, location, and direction may differ for each mode as long as the test set-up is \\nverified and provides repeatable results. Specific recommendations relevant to natural frequency \\nand mode shape testing are provided in  paragraphs 8.b. and 8.c., respectively. \\n(d) Fixture verification. Prior to acqui ring the certification modal test data, \\nconduct the following fixture verifi cation tests: attachment clampi ng; fixture modal interaction; \\nand pre- and post-te st repeatability. \\n1  Verify the fixture force require d to restrain the blade. This \\nassessment requires that the retention force be  increased incrementally until the change in \\nmeasured frequencies is minimized. Remove the blade and reinsta ll it between each load \\n6 \\n\\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\nincrement. The retention force should be suffici ent to ensure the blade frequencies for all \\nmodes are repeatable.  \\n2  To verify that the fixture modes do  not influence the test results, compare \\nthe frequencies and normal mode shapes measured in the fixture to those predicted by the FEA \\nusing a sample PMA or type de sign blade. This comparison may result in differences since a \\nperfectly rigid fixture cannot be constructed. If fixture modes influence the blade modes or the \\nfixture does not provide adequa te attachment retention, then  the demonstration of modal \\nsimilarity may be compromised. If this occurs, then the applicant must either redesign the fixture or show that the fixture flexibility do es not invalidate the modal comparisons. \\n3  Verify the ability of the fixture to produce repeatable results. Using a sample \\nPMA or type design blade, demons trate that the natural frequenc ies for each mode are similar \\nbefore and after the blade is removed, reinstalled, and retested. The frequency comparison must be performed for the number of mode s identified in paragraph 8.a.(3). \\n4  After performing the required modal tests, retest the blade tested in \\nparagraph 8.a.(2)(d)3  to ensure the frequencies measur ed in that paragraph have not \\nshifted. \\n(3) Number of Modes.  Using a type design blade or vane, determine by test the \\nnumber of modes up to the frequency associated  with the highest passage count within the \\nengine operating range of rotatio nal speeds. The determination of the number of modes requires \\na different approach for blades versus vanes,  as noted in paragraphs 8.a.(3)(b) and (c). \\n(a) The engine range of rotational speed s is from zero r.p.m. to the higher of 105% \\nof the maximum physical rotational speed permitte d for periods of two minutes or longer or \\n102% of any other permitted speeds including permitted overspeeds.  \\n(b) For a blade, the maximum test fr equency (in Hz) is computed based on: the \\nnumber of vanes—two rows forward, one row fo rward, or one row aft, whichever is greater; \\nmultiplied by the rotor speed (in r.p.m.); and divided by 60. All the modes up to and including this frequency must be part of the test program. \\n(c) For a vane, the maximum test frequency is computed based on:  the number of \\nblades—two rows forward, one row forward, or one row aft, whichever is greater; multiplied by the rotor speed r.p.m.; and divided by 60. All the modes up to and including this frequency must \\nbe part of the test program. \\n(4) Modal characteristic measurements. Modal characteristics are unique for each \\nblade. The applicant, therefore,  should measure all natural freque ncies and mode shapes for each \\nblade specimen tested. Do not develop test data  for the first mode based on a different set of \\nspecimens than used for the second or any other mode. More specific guidance on natural \\nfrequency and mode shape measurements is in paragraphs 8.b. and 8.c., respectively. \\n7 \\n\\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\n(5) Number of specimens.  Using statistical  tests to assess simila rity of parts produced \\nby two independent manufacturing pr ocesses is more challenging than applying statistical tests to \\ndetermine whether differences exist in two samp les taken from a common production process. \\nAccepted statistical prac tice requires use of a greater number of specimens when assessing \\nsimilarity between independent processes than for verifying a lack of differences within a \\ncommon process (see references in paragraphs 3. d. and f. for a discussion of “Type II error,” \\n“Beta error,” and “estimating sample size”). Sinc e subtle differences in blade geometry can \\nsignificantly affect the modal characteristics of bl ades and vanes, the applicant must show that \\nPMA manufacturing tolerances prod uce blades with similar modal characteristics to the type \\ndesign blades. To test whether the PMA blade desi gn accurately replicates  the type design blade \\nrequires a sample size sufficient to capture the effect of production ma nufacturing tolerances on \\nthe distribution of natural frequencies for each mo de. For example, the applicant should include \\nblades representing the high and low weight extremes m easured in paragraph 6.b. We \\nrecommend the applicant: \\n(a) Test a minimum of 50 new type design blades. The type design blade samples \\nshould be acquired from approved and traceable s ources. We suggest the blades be acquired in a \\nway that captures as many production process vari ables as possible, i.e ., procured over a period \\nof time and from different sources and multiple batches.  \\n(b) Test a minimum of 50 new PMA blades manufactured using the production \\nprocess. The goal is to test a sufficient number of PMA blades to ensure  that production process \\nvariability is represented in the testing.  \\n(6) Correlation of Modal Characteristic s.  Prior to conducting natural frequency \\ntesting, a representative blade s hould be tested for natural fr equencies and mode shapes and \\ncorrelated with the finite elemen t model developed in paragraph 8.a.(1). This correlation should \\nbe used to ensure that the test procedure accu rately captures all modes required in paragraph \\n8.a.(3). Additionally, the test procedure should be shown to be repeatable per paragraph \\n8.a.(2)(d). \\n(7) Consideration of Outliers.  Examine the test results to ensure the data is \\nrepresentative of the blade populat ion. If a blade is su spected of being an outlier, it may be \\nidentified using statistical test s based on z values (see references  in paragraphs 3.d. and f). The \\nstatistical test may only be used once on any given sample, or data set, meaning that only a single \\ndata point may be eliminated. Before proposing to eliminate a data po int, the reason for the \\nfaulty result must be investigated and explained. Retest outliers that are attributed to a faulty test \\nprocedure, preferably by using an improved test  procedure. Do not eliminate extreme blades \\nfrom the statistical population wi thout proof of part damage, a manufacturing anomaly, or other \\nidentifiable cause. A PMA outlier that is not attr ibutable to a faulty test procedure, part \\ngeometric discrepancy, or pre-test damage, and was produced by the production process, may be \\nan indication of an unstable production proces s or unacceptable drawing dimension. Such an \\noutlier may require improvements in the pr oduction process or changes to the drawing \\ntolerances.  \\n8 \\n\\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\nb. Natural frequencies . The applicant should test and compare the PMA and type design \\nblade natural frequencies to verify that they  are similar. Natural frequency testing and \\ncomparisons should be performed for all frequenc ies identified in paragr aph 8.a.(3) and for all \\nblades identified in  paragraph 8.a.(5). \\n(1) Measurement.  Natural frequencie s may be measured using any standard \\nmeasurement method, provided that the method pr oduces repeatable and accurate results; \\nhowever: \\n(a) For frequency testing, if impact hammer excitation is used, then care must be \\ntaken to ensure that the impact location adequate ly excites all required natural frequencies and \\nthat the impact excitation does not cause non-lin ear effects that adversely affect frequency \\nmeasurements. Before using impact hammer excita tion, applicants should test a representative \\nblade excited by shaker or acoustic horn to identi fy natural frequencies, then demonstrate that the \\nhammer test can accurately duplicate the frequency content.\\n (b) For response measurements, we  recommend the use of non-contacting \\nmeasurement devices, for example, laser displacement measurements or microphone \\nmeasurement of sound radiation from the blad e. The added mass of contact measurement \\ndevices, for example, accelerometers, would a lter the part’s mode shapes and natural \\nfrequencies. \\n(2) Pass/fail criteria. The blade natural frequencies are considered equivalent if the \\nPMA frequency scatter band for each mode is equal to or less than the scatter band of the type design parts. The frequency scatter band for each mode is computed using the measured \\nfrequencies by determining the mean frequency and the standard devi ation. The scatter band \\nlower bound frequency is defined as the mean minus three (-3) standard deviations. The upper bound frequency is defined as the mean plus three (+3) standard deviations.  \\n(a) The following pass/fail criteria mu st be met for each natural frequency: \\n1  The PMA parts’ lower bound frequency mu st be equal to or  greater than the \\nlower bound frequency established by the type design parts.  \\n2  The PMA parts’ upper bound frequency mu st be equal to or less than the \\nupper bound frequency established by the type design parts.  \\n3  The difference between the means of the PMA and type design samples \\nmust meet an 80% confidence test for means (s ee references in paragraphs 3.d. and f.).  \\n(b) If the preceding criteria are not met, applicants may expand the sample \\npopulations. Depending upon the manufacturing vari ables captured in the parts acquired in \\nparagraph 8.a.(5), the minimum sample size ma y not adequately characterize normal production \\nvariables. If this occurs, applicants may acqui re additional blades and test these to more \\naccurately establish the stat istical criteria used for the pass/fai l test. When adding more blades to \\nthe sample population: \\n9 \\n\\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n    \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\n1  Data for the additional blades must be  added to the original dataset inclusive \\nof all previously tested blades. No test data may be excluded. \\n2  The additional blades must be rand omly selected from production process \\nblades and may not be pre-screened. \\n(c) All blades that are tested to char acterize natural frequencies must be used in \\nmaking frequency pass/fail comparisons between the type design and the PMA blades. Do not \\nremove blades that meet production quality control checks from the data set based solely on their \\nmodal characteristics unless the removal can be justified to the FAA. \\nc. Normal Mode Shapes . Applicants should test and compare the PMA and type design \\nblade mode shapes to verify that they are similar. The mode shape testing and comparisons should be performed for all frequencies identified in paragraph 8.a.(3) using the same specimens \\nand boundary conditions used to measure the natural frequencies.  \\n(1) Use the following procedure to assess mode shapes: \\n(a) Selection of Blades. Mode shapes mu st be measured using the blades tested in \\nparagraph 8.b. to determine natural frequencies. Applicants may perform mode shape testing on \\nall PMA and type design blades or on a subset of blades from the frequency test. If the applicant \\nselects subset testing, two subs ets are required: a PMA subset and a type design subset.   \\n1  A blade subset usually contains at least three blades—at least one blade each \\nrepresents the nominal, lowest, a nd highest frequencies in the scatter band. We recognize that no \\nsingle blade will exhibit the nominal or one of the extreme frequency conditions. The applicant, therefore, should develop a statistical means to assess the frequency data and identify at least \\nthree blades that best represent the nominal and extreme frequencies when all modes are considered. If the screening me thod selected does not identify at  least three blades with the \\nnecessary characteristics, then a suitable number of blades will need to be tested. \\n2  If the applicant is unable to develop a means to select an appropriate subset \\nof blades, or if the method developed fails to iden tify a subset of blades representing the nominal \\nand the extreme frequencies, then mode shapes should be measured and compared for all blades. \\n(b) Measurement.  Mode shape measurement involves measuring the deflected \\nshape, also known as the modal displacements, a ssociated with each natural frequency. Use the \\nfollowing techniques to measure mode shapes: \\n1  The modal displacements may be measured by laser vibrometry, laser \\nholography, or other methods, provided the method selected is able to meet the following \\nrequirements: \\n10 \\n\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   9/8/09 \\t AC 33.83-1 \\n•\\t The measurement technique must be able to determine the magnitude of the \\ndisplacements at each measurement location.  \\n•\\t The measurement technique is accurate and repeatable. \\n•\\t A sufficient number of locations on the part surface can be meas ured to accurately \\ncharacterize the shape of each mode. When assessing the number of measurement points \\nrequired, we recommend that applicants use the same number of measurement locations \\nfor all modes. The number of locations shoul d be determined based on the number of \\nmeasurements required to characteri ze the most complex mode shape.  \\n2  We recommend that shaker or acoustic  horn excitation be used when making \\nmode shape measurements due to their ability to  provide repeatable modal displacement results. \\nImpact hammer testing is not recommended for m ode shape testing of blades due to potential \\nlocal nonlinear response effects associated with impacting thin  blade sections. The non-linear \\nresponse near the impact site may reduce accu racy of modal displacement measurements. \\n3  We recommend non-contacting displa cement measurement methods (for \\nexample, lasers) over contact type methods (f or example, accelerometers) because the added \\nmass of the instrumentation will alter the part’s mode shapes and natural frequencies. \\n4  Do not use measurement methods that provide a qualitative  visualization of \\nmode shape deflections (for example, powder visualization or Stress Pattern Analysis by \\nThermal Emissivity (SPATE)) but have not dem onstrated the ability to accurately measure \\ndisplacements (or other appropria te response) and quantify sim ilarity between mode shapes. \\n5  Mode shapes should be normalized before comparison. Any standard mode \\nshape normalization procedure (i.e., unit or ma ss normalization) may be used, provided it is \\napplied consistently to  all mode shapes.  \\n(2) Pass/Fail criteria. The normal modes are considered equivalent when they can be \\nquantitatively shown to be similar. The Modal Assurance Criteria (MAC) has demonstrated the \\nability to compare the displacements from tw o mode shapes and quantitatively assess their \\nsimilarity. Refer to reference in paragraph 3.c. for a high level overview of MAC; see reference \\nin paragraph 3.b. for a more detailed view. The following pass/fail assessment procedure \\nillustrates the application of the MAC. \\n(a) The PMA blade mode shapes shoul d be compared against the type design \\nblade mode shapes. It is not acceptable to comp are PMA blades to PMA blades and type design \\nblades to type design blades. If all blades ar e tested, then all PMA bl ades should be assessed \\nagainst all type design blades. If  the subset testing approach is selected, then all PMA subset \\nblades should be compared agains t all type design  subset blades. \\n(b) The PMA and type design mode shap es are considered equivalent for each \\nmode when the displacement am plitudes at each measurement lo cation are similar. If MAC is \\nused, a MAC value greater than 0.9 should be achi eved for all modes. We will consider modes \\n11 \\n\\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\nthat do not meet the 0.9 criterion if the applicant can explain the results with supporting FEA or \\nadditional test data. \\n(c) All blades that are tested to char acterize normal mode shapes must be used in \\nmaking the pass/fail criteria mode shape comp arisons between the type design and the PMA \\nblades. Do not remove blades that meet productio n quality control checks from the data set based \\nsolely on their modal characteristics unless the removal can be justified to the FAA. \\n9. Comparative Method of Assessing Fatigue Strength.   This paragraph outlines the \\ncomparative testing and analysis method applican ts would use to demonstrate that a PMA blade \\nhas equivalent blade fatigue stre ngth to the type design blade. The PMA and type design blades \\nmust be representative of their design, incl uding any manufacturing processes, such as \\nshotpeening or coating, that may affect the fati gue capability of the part . Applicants should use \\nthe following procedure to demonstrat e equivalent blade fatigue strength. \\na. Applicants should develop an analytical m odel (usually a finite element model) of the \\nproposed PMA blade and use it to predict the failu re locations expected during fatigue testing. \\nThe analytical model should have the capability to accurately predict the blade maximum stress \\nlevel, the maximum stress location, and the stress  distribution for the mo de selected to conduct \\nthe fatigue tests. The predicted stress level and crack locations shoul d be correlated to the \\nexperimental measurements. The model should also  be correlated with the measured natural \\nfrequencies and mode shapes. If the applicant doe s not use an analytical model to assess stress \\ndistribution and failure locations, then a thorough experiment al stress assessment must be \\nconducted with adequate measurements to quan tify maximum stress locations and the stress \\ngradients. \\nb. Select a resonant mode, usually the first bending mode, at which to conduct the fatigue \\ntests. A blade tested at the firs t bending mode would usually be e xpected to crack in the airfoil. \\nThe test fixture should be verified for the se lected mode by the same methods indicated in \\nparagraph 8.a.(2)(d) to ensure the part restraint is maintained for the duration of each test, is \\nrepeatable, and no fixture modes are introduced during testing. \\nc. Select a minimum of 30 blades of each PM A and type design. Inspect  all blades prior to \\ntesting to ensure they have no defects. For each test blade, generate a room temperature \\ncalibration curve which plots the measured blad e stresses versus tip displacement amplitude. \\nApply a sufficient number of strain gages at or ne ar the expected failure locations to ensure the \\nstresses at the crack site(s) are accurately dete rmined. The calibration curve must be generated \\nfor the mode selected for fatigue testing and for the locations where the crack initiation is expected. Record the excitation input (for exam ple, displacement, velocity, or acceleration) \\nrequired to produce the given amount of tip amplit ude. The calibration curves for the type design \\nand proposed PMA blades must be similar. The tip displacement and measured stresses per unit input should be equivalent. \\nd. Conduct fatigue tests for each blade in paragraph 9.c. at a metal temperature \\nrepresentative of the blade aver age metal temperature for the representative engine operating \\ncondition, unless other data shows that an altern ate temperature is repr esentative and approved \\n12 \\n\\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\nby the FAA. Monitor and control the test so that the stress level at the critical location is held \\nconstant. One method to do this is to calibrate tip deflection against critical location strain \\nmeasurements, then monitor and control tip deflec tion during the test to control stress level. If \\nthe calibration curve was determined at room te mperature, correct it for the actual test \\ntemperature. The number of stress levels tested should be sufficient to support the technique used \\nto compare the fatigue capability of the proposed PMA and type design blades. \\ne. When conducting the fatigue test, the target  test duration for each test blade should be \\nbetween 10\\n5 and 107 cycles. Of the 30 blades, test a mini mum of 25 until a crack develops. The \\nremaining blades may be run-outs (uncracked at 107 cycles). The test blade failures should be \\ndistributed over the cycle range. If an unexpected crack location is  encountered and the crack site \\nstresses cannot be determined because the alternat e site lacked a strain gage, applicants may use \\nthe analytical model described in paragraph 9.a. to determine the stress level. To utilize the \\nanalytical model, the actual blad e that cracked at an unexpected location should be measured and \\nthe dimensional measurements used to analyze th at particular blade. An alternate approach \\nwould be to conduct further fatigue testing with  strain gages placed at the alternate crack \\nlocation(s). Applicants must t horoughly analyze unexpected failure  locations and discuss them \\nwith the FAA. \\nf. Perform post-test metallurgical examina tions to ensure the fatigue crack initiation \\nlocation and crack formation mechanism on the proposed PMA blade and the type design blade \\nare the same. In addition, verify that the fatigue crack was not initiated by a material defect such \\nas a nick, scratch, pore, void or unacceptable micr ostructure. Material def ects detected in a PMA \\nblade would disqualify the test da ta and require further investigat ion to determine root cause. If \\ndefects are detected, applicants must  review this result with the FAA. \\ng. Based on the acquired fatigue test data and using standard re gression analysis (see \\nreference in paragraph 3.d.), st atistical techniques, and linear extrapolation, compute the \\nminimum (-3 standard deviations) fatigue strength at 108 cycles for the PMA and type design \\nblades. The test stress level at th e crack site should be used to  represent the high cycle fatigue \\ncapability of each test blade.   \\nh. The minimum fatigue strength at 108 cycles of the proposed PMA blade must be at least \\nequal to that of the type design blade. In addi tion, applicants should assess the failure locations \\nand failure mechanisms and show them to be th e same. The crack location should be repeatable \\nand must be consistent between the proposed PM A and type design blades. If more than one \\ncrack site is detected in the original blade fatigue tests, the PMA blades may not crack at the secondary site at a higher rate  than the original blades unl ess it can be explained.   \\n13 \\n\\n    \\n \\n  \\n 9/8/09 AC 33.83-1 \\n10. Maintaining Compliance to § 33.83.  PMA applicants must develop a design specification \\nto support a quality control program to ensu re that the production PMA blades’ natural \\nfrequencies and high-cycle fatigue ca pability continue to be consis tent with the PMA blades used \\nto gain FAA approval. The program may involve sampling plans and statistical process control techniques. It may also involve the measurement of  a combination of or a subset of dimensions, \\nmaterial metallurgical properties, natural fr equencies, HCF properties, and other part \\ncharacteristics to ensure the producti on process is stable and repeatable. \\nFrancis A.

BACKGROUND . The Federal Aviation Administrati on (FAA) is aware that there are \\nmany repair stations in the aviation industry that have tal ented and knowledgeable \\npersonnel who are performing a much needed service in repairing otherwise \\nunserviceable parts. However, the FAA has been made aware of repaired crankcases \\nand cylinders which have failed in-ser vice, resulting in accidents. \\na. Major weld repair procedures not cont ained in the manufacturer\\'s maintenance \\nmanuals have been developed and used by r epair stations in a non-uniform manner. \\nBefore weld repair procedures may be added to the operation specific ations of a repair \\n3 \\n\\n \\n 12/20/94 AC 33-6 \\nstation (with a specialized Service Rating for Welding), a process specification, \\nbased upon substantiating data approved by the Administrator, must be developed. \\nb. This advisory circular is meant to standardize the procedure for development of \\napproved data for weld repair specifications for piston engine crankcases and cylinders. \\n5. DEFINITION. For the purpose of this advis ory circular, the following definitions will \\nbe used in conjunction with all applic able airworthiness requirements: \\na. Acceptable Data. Technical data which was examined and accepted by the FAA. \\nData that may be used on an in dividual basis to obtain app roval are: FAA Advisory \\nCirculars; Manufacturer\\'s technical information (for example, manuals, bulletins, kits, \\netc.); and FAA Field Approvals. \\nb. Approved Data. Technical data whic h was examined and approved (for major \\nrepairs and alterations) through applicabl e FAA authority, or previously approved \\ndocuments such as advisory circulars or manufa cturers\\' service bulletins. This includes: \\nType Certificate Data Sheets, Supplemental Type Certificates (STCs), Airworthiness \\nDirectives, Manufacturer\\'s FAA approved data , Designated Engineer ing Representative \\n(DER) approved data, and Designated Al teration Station (DAS) approved data \\ndeveloped for alterations perfo rmed by that station only. \\nc. Repair. A procedure performed on a pr oduct or component part that does not \\nchange its form or function. \\n(1) Major Repair. A repair that: if impr operly done, might appreciably affect \\nweight, balance, structural strength, per formance, powerplant operation, flight \\ncharacteristics, or other qualit ies affecting airworthiness; or is not done according to \\naccepted practices or cannot be done by elementary operations. \\n(2) Minor Repair. Any repair that is not classified as a major repair. \\nd. Technical Data. Information necessary to define and substantiate a repair \\nprocedure, in compliance with applicable airworthiness standards, including the following: drawings, sketches, and/or photogr aphs; stress analysis; engineering orders; \\nand operating limitations. \\n6. DISCUSSION. \\na. Welding Criteria. The applicant\\'s process specification should contain criteria for \\ndetermining the area and nature of  the weld repair. The criteria must be sufficient to \\ndetermine the nature of the weld and extent of the repair necessary, to assure the \\napplicable procedure will return the component to airworthy condition. This criteria will \\ninclude a procedure for determining when re pairs cannot be effected. The following \\nareas are considered to be of critical impor tance and require special consideration in \\nanalyzing the supporting data used for substantia tion of these repairs. Weld repairs in \\nthe following areas, unless approved by  the engine manufacturer, must be \\nsubstantiated by a detailed anal ysis of the repair that ensur es the airworthiness of the \\n4 \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 12/20/94 AC 33-6 \\npart. Substantiation may include dimensions (l ocations and alignments of critical areas), \\nhardness tests (before and after welding), full scale engine block test, in-service tests \\nwhich include periodic inspections (on si milarly repaired cylinders or crankcase), \\nindustry standards, fatigue testi ng, and engineering analyses. \\n(1) Crankcase: \\n(i) Crankcase bores. \\n(ii) Supports, webs, and fillets of the crankcase bearing bores. \\n(iii) Areas on or adjacent to any st ud holes, or cylinder decks, or mating \\nflanges. \\n(iv) Cracks in any areas, if they are in excess of three and one-half inches \\nlong. \\n(2) Cylinders: \\n(i) Crack(s) through a seat boss. \\n(ii) Crack(s) between two seats. \\n(iii) Crack(s) through the guide boss. \\n(iv) Circumferential cra ck(s) in the head area. \\n(v) Broken pieces built up by weldi ng, such as, rocker arm shaft bosses. \\n(vi) Dome cracks over thr ee-eighths of an inch depth. \\n(vii) More than two cracks emanating from any port. \\n(viii)Crack(s) over one and one-quarter inch in length. \\n(ix) More than three welded cracks. \\n(x) Port crack(s), if exhaust port cr ack(s) exceeds one and one-quarter inch \\nin length, or one-quarter inch in depth; or is  within one-quarter inch of valve seat boss. \\n(xi) Welding or machining of cyli nder attach flange, other than routine \\nlapping to obtain flatness and to remove scratches and burrs. \\nb. Inspection Criteria. The applicant\\'s proce ss specification must contain criteria for \\ninspection of the part, pursuant to data approved by the Admi nistrator. Procedures must \\ninclude visual and dimensional inspections prior to repair, to  determine the extent of the \\nrepair necessary. Procedures must also include criteria for determini ng whether a repair \\nis within the capabilities of the applicant to perform under its process. \\n5 \\n\\n \\n 02/27/17 AC 33-6, Chg 1 \\n(1) Welds shall be limited to those which can be inspected, in accordance with \\napproved procedures, i.e., Non- Destructive Inspection (NDI). Procedures must include \\npost-weld inspection criteria necessary to determine the airworthiness of the \\ncomponent, after approved repairs have been a ccomplished.Guidance for developing \\ninspection criteria may be obtained by referri ng to the visual and dimensional limitations \\ncontained in manufacturers\\' maintenance documents. Guidance for developing non-\\ndestructive testing procedures may be obtai ned from referenced industry, and military \\nstandards and specifications on inspection a nd heat treatment techniques. The most \\ncommon inspection techniques include Dye P enetrant Inspection (DPI) and Fluorescent \\nPenetrant Inspection (FPI) per AMS 2645 or ASTM E1417. Personnel performing NDI \\nmust be trained and qualified in t he disciplines being performed. \\n(2) Preheating the case or cylinder to approximately 200 degrees F before \\ninspection will enhance crack detection. \\n(3) After welding and stress relief, repeat  dimensional and crack inspection. \\nc. Preparation of  Weld Area. \\n(1) Disassembly and Removal Procedures. The applicant\\'s process specification \\nmust contain necessary disassembly instru ctions to permit pr oper cleaning of the \\ncomponent. These instructions, if  required, must specify thos e parts to be removed and \\ntheir method of removal. \\n(2) Cleaning Procedures. The process s pecification must have an acceptable \\nmethod of cleaning co mponents. Cleaning must be perform ed in order to permit proper \\ninspection, as well as to assure welding which is free of foreign material contamination. \\nCare should be taken to ensure that cleani ng solutions are not entrapped in the \\ncomponent being cleaned. \\n(i) Cleaning agents used shall be limited to those which can be shown to be \\ncompatible with the materials being cleaned.  Compatibility is defined as those agents \\nwhich do not cause embrittlement or corrosion of the component material. \\n(ii) Where solid media blasting is  used for cleaning, compatibility \\nrequirements as described above shall apply. Additionally, methods employed for media \\nblasting must provide for complete removal of all blasting media. Blasting methods must be shown not to cause peening of material, so as to close surface cracks or to \\nexcessively distort machined surfaces. \\nd. Preparation for welding. \\n(1) Inert gas arc welding is the most common method used for this type of \\nwelding. A process specification for inert gas arc welding that uses filler material, must \\naddress methods for preparation of the area to be welded. These preparation methods \\nshould address the following areas: \\n6 \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 02/27/17 AC 33-6, Chg 1 \\n(i) Cleaning of the area necessary to obtain a high quality weld (use of \\nsolvent and steel wire brush). \\n(ii) Method by which cracked or dam aged material is removed to permit \\nwelding. \\n(iii) Inspection method for determining that all cracked or damaged material \\nhas been removed prior to welding. \\nWhere other welding technologies that do not add filler material are used in the process \\nspecifications, preparation methods must be shown to produce a high quality weld. \\n(2) Preheating aluminum prior to welding is normally required because: \\n(i) Aluminum casting is porous and tends  to become saturated with oil that \\nwould contaminate the weld. \\n(ii) Preheating brings the oil to the surface of the material. \\n(iii) Aluminum is very conducti ve, and preheating prevents heat from \\nconducting away from weld area. \\n(3) If a welding method, other than the I nert Gas Arc, is used and preheating is \\ndetermined not to be advantageous, the subst antiating data should include the reason \\nfor this determination. \\n(4) Where preheating is determined advantage ous in producing the best quality \\nweld for the process specification, the prehe at time and temperat ure must be shown to \\nbe adequate for the parent material, filler ma terial, and specific welding process. \\n(i) The procedure must include a met hod for determining the temperature of \\nthe component, the tolerances of the preheat temperature,  and the method for \\nmaintaining the temperature during the welding process. \\n(ii) A preheat temperature of 450 to 475 degrees F, for two to four hours, \\nhas been found acceptable for Lycoming cases.  A preheat temperature of 375 to 400 \\ndegrees F, for two to four hours, has been found acceptable for Continental Motors \\ncases. For other manufacturer’s cases, y ou must have preheat te mperatures approved \\nby the Administrator. \\ne. Weld Procedure Criteria. The applicant\\' s process specification shall set forth \\nweld procedures that are dem onstrated to return the component to airworthy condition. \\n(1) The equipment requirements shall be those necessary to accomplish the \\nwelding process. Maintenance and record of such machinery shall comply with \\nequipment manufacturer\\'s recommendations  or acceptable industry standards. \\n7 \\n\\n \\n 12/20/94 AC 33-6 \\n(2) If the process specification require s filler material, the filler shall be \\ndemonstrated to be compatible with the parent material and not affect the airworthiness \\nof the component. Guidance for determining f iller material compatibility may be found in \\nthe military and industry standards for we lding aerospace aluminum castings. \\n(3) The process specification should addr ess the method by which distortion is \\nminimized during the weld procedure. In ce rtain instances, it has been helpful to \\nconstrain the component in a proper fixture during preheating, welding, and stress relief. \\n(4) Weld rod of AMS 4190 (AA 4043) is a cceptable for all aluminum alloys; \\nexcept AMS 4031, AMS 4143, or AMS 4313, which require weld rod of equivalent \\nmaterial. \\nf. Stress-Relief Criteria . The applicant\\'s process s pecification shall contain \\nprocedures for assuring that post-weld stre ss relief shall be performed in a manner that \\nensures the component is restored to an airworthy condition. \\n(1) Post-weld stress relief by heat tr eatment shall be performed in such a \\nmanner, and provide for time and temperature requirements, necessary to ensure the \\ncomponent is returned to an airworthy condi tion. The procedure shall be substantiated \\nby reference to acceptable military or i ndustry specifications or by metallurgical \\nanalysis. \\n(2) If it is determined that post-weld h eat treatment is not required, either \\nbecause of the weld procedure incorporated or another  method of stress relief is used, \\nthe process specification must include the reasons for this determination. \\ng. Post-Weld Machining Criteria. The applicant \\'s process specification shall set forth \\nan inspection procedure which shall dete rmine the extent and nat ure of machining \\nnecessary to correct any misalignment or dist ortion of areas adjacent to the weld repair. \\nThis procedure can allow for the installation of approved undersized or oversized parts. \\n(1) The process specification shal l have methods by which approved \\ndimensions are determined and conformed to. The dimensions may be obtained from \\nmanufacturers\\' manuals, service bulletins, or  other technical publications, or by \\nspecifications established by the applicant and approved through the FAA by analysis, \\ntesting, or other acceptable methods. \\n(2) The process specification shall set fo rth the method of ma chining which shall \\nbe demonstrated to return the component to airworthy condition. Hand-finishing and \\nblending of non-machined cast areas shall be s hown to conform to in-service limits for \\napproval for return to service. Surface-fini sh limits shall confo rm to manufacturers\\' \\npublished data or acceptable data established by the applicant to be equivalent. \\nh. Qualification of Personnel. The applicant shall set forth the method by which \\npersonnel necessary to perform the tasks shall be qualified, trained, and re-trained. \\n8 \\n\\n \\n \\n 02/27/17 AC 33-6, Chg 1 \\n(1)Personnel shall demonstrate the ability  to perform the necessary operations\\nupon the material and by the methods set forth in the process specifications. \\n(2)The applicant may refer to the criteria  set forth in the repair station manual\\nfor qualifying, training, and re-training the welding personnel. Guidance for developing \\nadequate training may be obtained from industry and military standards. \\ni.Approved Data Criteria. The applicant\\'s process specification must be\\naccompanied by a detailed analysis of the comp lete process, sufficient to document the \\nability to assure the airw orthiness of the component. \\n(1)The detailed analysis shall be accomp lished in such a manner and include\\ndimensions, tolerances, alignments, hardness specifications, surface finishing \\nspecifications, and other technical data nece ssary to assure that the component\\'s \\nintegrity meets its proper ly altered condition approved by the Administrator. \\n(2)Technical data may be obtained from such sources as:\\n(i) Manufacturer design drawings which have been issued for an engine\\nhaving a type certificate. \\n(ii) Manufacturer overhaul manuals, serv ice bulletins, and tables of limits.\\n(iii) Military specificati ons, government specifications and other industry\\nstandards. \\n(iv) Data obtained on the basis of analyt ical testing, such as, metallurgical\\nevaluation, fatigue testing, and engineering analysis. \\n(v) Data supported by a block test or a model test that simulates a\\nspecified test period. \\n(vi) Data supported by in-service testing.\\n(vii) Data which is consistent with a documented service history that\\ndemonstrates reliability and viability of the repair, including drawings, dimensional \\ncharts, and clearances. \\nj.Markings. All crankcases and cylinder s that have been weld  repaired shall be\\npermanently marked, in order to identify t he station which performed the work. For the \\nbenefit of consistency among the various r epair stations, it is recommended that the \\nfollowing marking procedure be used: \\n(1)One-eighth inch letters; a \"W\" to i ndicate a weld, followed by the repair\\nstation certificate number, and ending with  the date. For ex ample: W-XXXX-XXXX-\\n3/18/XX. \\n9 \\n12/20/94 AC 33-6\\n(2)For crankcase halves;\\n the marking may be steel stamped, electrolytic\\netched, or vibrati on peened, along the t op mating surface. \\n(3)For cylinders; the marking may be vibration peened or electrolytic etched, on\\nthe top surface of the uppermost fin area, above the exhaust port. \\n/s/ J.

Purpose .  This advisory circular (AC) provi des definitions and guidance regarding \\ncompliance with the strength requirements for pre ssurized engine static parts in § 33.64 of Title \\n14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CF R part 33).  Section 33.64 establishes strength \\nrequirements for pressurized static engine parts that operate at significan t pressure levels.   \\n \\n2.   Applicability. \\n \\na. The guidance is directed to engine manuf acturers, modifiers, foreign regulatory \\nauthorities, and part manufact urers who operate under Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) \\nauthority. \\n \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor regul atory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation.  It describes acceptable means, but not  the only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations.  The FAA w ill consider other methods of demonstrating \\ncompliance that an applicant may elect to present.   Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and \\n“must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of \\ncompliance when the acceptable method of complia nce in this document is used.  While these \\nguidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in \\ndetermining compliance with the relevant regulations.  On the other hand, if the FAA becomes \\naware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance.   \\n \\nc. This material does not change, create any additional, auth orize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n \\n \\n9/13/10     AC 33.64-1 \\n3.

For the purpose of this AC, the followi ng definitions apply and should be related \\nto an engine operating in  a typical installation: \\n  a.  Burst.   Failure or fracture of a part which involves the sudden release of pressurized fluid \\n(gaseous or liquid).   b.  Failure.   A change in the condition of  the part such that it is no longer able to perform its \\nexpected function (in this cas e contain pressurized fluid). \\n  c.   Fracture.   Separation of the part into  two or more pieces or into a condition so that it is \\nno longer whole or complete.   d.  Hazardous condition.  Any of the conditi ons listed in § 33.75. \\n  e.   Normal working pressure .  The maximum pressure diffe rential likely to  occur during \\nmost flights, including pressure  fluctuations (surges) from th e normal operation of valves and \\norifices.   f.   Maximum working pressure .  The maximum pressure di fferential that could occur \\nunder the most adverse operational conditions (for  example, forward speed, altitude, ambient \\ntemperature, engine speed, and use of OEI ratings ).  This includes any pressure fluctuations, \\nincluding significant surge pressures, resulting from the normal operation of valves or orifices.   g. Maximum possible pressure.   The maximum pressure di fferential that could occur \\nunder the most adverse combination of operatio nal conditions (for example, forward speed, \\naltitude, ambient temperature, e ngine speed, and use of OEI ratings ) likely to occur in service in \\ncombination with failure of any relevant part(s) of  the engine or control system, or combinations \\nof failures that are more likely than extremely re mote.  All pressure fluctuations which result \\nfrom the normal or emergency use of controls and valves should be considered including \\nsignificant surge pressures.  \\n  h.  Most critically stressed engine condition .  The condition with the lowest margin \\nassociated with the conditions specified by § 33.64(a)(1) and (a)(2). \\n2 \\n9/13/10     AC 33.64-1 \\n \\n \\ni.  Static parts subject to sign ificant gas or liquid pressure loads .  Those static parts \\nsubject to high-pressure loads, or whose design is influenced by the gas or liquid pressure loads \\nthe part is designed to contain.  Examples might  include the compressor, combustor and turbine \\ncasings, heat exchangers, bleed valve solenoids, starter motors or fuel, oil and hydraulic system components.  Special attention s hould be given to any filler cap. \\n 6.  Guidance.  Compliance with § 33.64 can be based on a test demonstration or analysis or a \\ncombination of both.  \\n a.  Strength Requirements. \\n \\n  (1) Section 33.64(a)(1) requir es that pressure loaded static parts not exhibit excessive \\npermanent distortion or leakage that could cr eate a hazardous condition when subjected to the \\npressure loads specified by § 33.64(a)(1) and (b) for a stabilized period of one minute.    (2) Section 33.64(a)(2) requir es that pressure loaded static parts not fracture or burst \\nwhen subjected to the pressure loads specified  by § 33.64(a)(2) and (b) fo r a stabilized period of \\none minute.    (3) The serviceable limits contained in th e engine manual should be used to determine \\nthe acceptable amount of permanent distortion.  \\n b.  Tests. \\n \\n  (1) If the part is subject to loads in add ition to those resulting from differential pressure \\n(for example, flight maneuver loads or engine mounting loads), an analysis should be made to \\nexamine the effect of these additional loads.  If these loads have a minor effect, it may be \\npossible to simulate the additional loads by increasing the test pressu re differential.  However, if \\nthe loads are significant or cannot be adequately represented by a pressure increment, the test \\nshould include these loads as well as the pressure loads.    (2) If during actual engine operation the part contains thermal stresses, the test pressure level may be adjusted to include th ese effects.  If the pressure le vel cannot be adjusted to include \\nthese effects, then the capability  of the part may be demonstrat ed by correcting th e test results \\nanalytically.    (3) If a part is subjected to pressure le vels which vary by part  location (internal or \\nexternal pressure gradie nt) in service, the test pressures and loads which simulate service \\nconditions may also vary by location.    (4)  The part should be tested at the temp erature associated with the most critically \\nstressed engine condition(s).  An acceptable altern ate approach would increa se the test pressure \\ndifferential and/or loads to simulate the loss of strength associated with operating temperature.  \\nThe applicant has the option to simulate separate test temperatures if needed, i.e., a temperature \\n3 \\n9/13/10     AC 33.64-1 \\n4 to simulate the permanent distortion conditions  specified by § 33.64(a)(1) and a temperature to \\nsimulate the fracture conditi ons specified by § 33.64(a)(2). \\n \\n  (5) Component pressure tests should si mulate the actual mounting and restraint \\nconditions consistent with engine ope ration at the critical part location. \\n   (6) Component pressure tests must take into account the minimum properties \\nrepresentative of both th e material and the processes used in the construction of the part and any \\nadverse geometry conditions allowed by the type  design, as required by § 33.64(b)(3) and (b)(4). \\n  c.  Analytical Methods.   Analytical techniques may be  used to meet the strength \\nrequirements as defined by § 33.64, providing the model is validated  by tests or the method has \\nbeen used on parts of similar design a nd the field experience has been successful. \\n \\nFrancis A.

Purpose .  This advisory circular (AC) provide s guidance and acceptable methods, but not the \\nonly methods, that may be used to demonstrate compliance with the engine component and \\nsystems test  requirements under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), part 33, \\nspecifically §  33.91, paragraphs (a) and (b). \\n \\n2.  Applicability. \\n      a.  The guidance provided in this AC is directed to the engine manufacturer, modifier, or \\nforeign regulatory authority.        b.  This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a regulation.  The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may elect to present.  Terms such as \"should,\" \"shall,\" \"may,\" and \"must\" are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used.  While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the relevant regulations.  On the other hand, if we become aware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in comp liance with the applicable regulations, we will \\nnot be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance.       c.  This material does not change, create any additional changes, authorize changes in, or permit deviations from existing regulatory requirements.  \\n3.  Applicable Regulation .  14 CFR part 33.91, Engine System and Component Tests, \\nparagraphs (a) and (b).  \\n 4.  Definitions .  For the purpose of this AC, the following definitions apply: \\n \\n     a.  Component\\n:  Any individual device that is part of a specific engine system.  Examples of \\nengine components include, but are not limited to, fuel pump, oil pump, hydraulic pump, heat exchanger, hydromechanical fuel control, bleed air check valve, fuel shutoff valve, electronic  \\n12/9/10                                                                                                                         AC 33.9 1-1 \\n 2 \\n engine control device, ignitors, exciters, engine parameter sensors, accessory drive gearbox, etc.  These components are generally mounted externally on the engine case, but some may be internally mounted, such as the temperature, pressure, speed, and torque sensors.  Other types of components may also be affected.        b.  System\\n:  A combination of inter-related components arranged to perform a specific \\nfunction.  Examples of engine systems are lubri cation (e.g., main engine oil), hydraulic, air bleed \\n(e.g., secondary/cooling/anti-ice), electrical , or similar engine type functions.  \\n \\n5.  General .  The intent of §  33.91, paragraphs (a) and (b) is to demonstrate by test that engine \\ncomponents and systems will perform satisfactorily in service, when operated at the limits of \\nengine  environmental and operating conditions.  This requires that an individual component or \\ncomplete system be tested under a variety of conditions.  The applicable environmental conditions will vary with the type of component, engine model, intended aircraft installation, and corresponding operating conditions and limitations.  Testing under §\\n 33.91, paragraphs (a) and \\n(b) is generally conducted when endurance testing under §  33.87 (or other part 33 requirements) \\nis not sufficient to cover the extreme conditions that can be encountered in service.  Successfully completing the applicable tests in accordance with the methods of compliance described in this AC, may be an acceptable showing of compliance to §\\n 33.91, paragraphs (a) and (b).  See \\nAppendix 1 of this AC, reference 1, paragraphs 1-4 provide an additional perspective on general historical § 33.91 compliance.  \\n \\n6.  Test Categories . \\n \\n     a.  Table 1 below provides a summary of the testing we have found sufficient to meet the requirements of §\\n 33.91, paragraphs (a) and (b).  The identified test procedures cover many \\ncomponents and systems, however, not all test categories will apply to all types of components or systems, and other test categories that are not listed may apply.  The identified tests are only required when the engine certification program content does not expose the component to the extreme conditions defined for that engine type design.  Table 1 of reference 1 provides guidance on when a test category would generally apply to a particular component or system.  Also, the \\nlatest revision of documents referenced in Table 1 should be applied unless otherwise identified in the approved test plan.       b.  The references in Table 1 generally provide acceptable guidance for the noted test categories.  However, the test parameter ranges specified in these documents must be verified to ensure they cover the component throughout the engine operating environment, including limits specified in the engine Installation Manual.  Specific test procedures or limits should be developed when the test parameter ranges or procedures specified in the referenced documents are not sufficient to cover the engine operating environment. \\n12/9/10                                                                                                                         AC 33.9 1-1 \\n 3 \\n \\nTABLE 1 \\n \\nTest \\nNo. Test Category Acceptable Test \\nProcedures Comment \\n1 High Temperature  ARP5757 Sec 5.1  See Note 1 \\n2 Low Temperature  ARP5757 Sec 5.2  See Note 1 \\n3 Room Temperature  ARP5757 Sec 5.3  See Note 1 \\n4 Contaminated Fluids ARP5757, Section \\n5.4 See Note 1 \\n5 Vibration DO-160 Section 8 See Notes 2 and 3 \\n6 Operational Shock & Crash Safety DO-160 Section 7 See Notes 2 and 3 \\n7 Sustained Acceleration ARP5757, Section \\n5.7 See Note 1 \\n8 Sand & Dust DO-160 Section 12 See Notes 2 and 3 \\n9 Fluids Susceptibility DO-160 Section 11 See Notes 2 and 3 \\n10 Salt Fog  DO-160 Section 14 See Notes 2 and 3 \\n11 Fuel System Icing ARP5757, Section \\n5.11  Refer to § 33.67 for requirements. \\n12 Induction Icing AC 20-147  Refer to § 33.68 for \\nrequirements and AC 20-147 for guidance. \\n13 Fungus Resistance DO-160 Section 13 See Notes 2 and 3 \\n14 Temperature & Altitude DO-160 Section 4 See Notes 2 and 3 \\n15 Temperature Variation  DO-160 Section 5 See Notes 2 and 3.

Conduct of Tests. \\n      a.  Connection and Orientation of Components under Test\\n:  Generally, the test article should \\nbe connected and oriented (mechanically and electrically) in a similar manner (or functional equivalent) as it would be if installed on the engine.       b.  Order of Tests\\n:  Tests may be conducted in any order and on any test article, except as  \\nnoted in reference 2, section 3.2. \\n \\n12/9/10                                                                                                                         AC 33.9 1-1 \\n 7 \\n      c.  Combining Tests\\n:  Test procedures may be combined if you can demonstrate that the \\nseverity of all applicable conditions specified in the individual procedures, are equaled or exceeded in a combined test procedure (also see reference 2, section 3.3).        d.  Test Equipment Calibration\\n:  All equipment used in these tests should be identified by \\nmake, model, serial number, software version, calibration expiration date, and must be within calibration.  As applicable, all calibrations should be traceable to recognized standards.  This information should be included in the test plan and final report.        e.  Test Parameter Tolerance\\n:  Unless otherwise specified in your approved test plan, required \\ntest parameter values are either a minimum for high limits (for example, high temperature endurance test), or a maximum for low limits (for example, low temperature endurance test).  You may need to adjust the selected parameter values based on test equipment accuracy, to assure that the required limit values are actually attained during the test.       f.  Pass/Fail Criteria\\n:  The pass/fail criteria for most §  33.91, paragraphs (a) and (b) tests are \\nsummarized below:            (1)  The component meets its design specification performance standards during operational testing and at the conclusion of the test.           (2)  No functional  changes occur during the test resulting in significant engine events affecting safety or operability of the engine.            (3)  Successful post-test completion of the applicable Production Acceptance Test (PAT) sections to serviceable or ultimate limits, as appropriate, for that particular test category.           (4)  Post-test inspection or disassembly (if required by the test plan), reveals no impending failures or damage which could impair the components’ ability to function in a safe manner.   \\nNote :  The provisions above are applicable for most components.  Your \\napproved test plan for each component under test must specify the required post-test actions and detailed pass/fail criteria.  \\n \\n8.  Other Considerations. \\n      a.  Conformity Requirements\\n:  The cognizant engine and/or aircraft certification office will \\ndetermine the conformity requirements for test articles.  You should develop a comprehensive conformity plan for engine type certification projects that require §\\n 33.91 tests.  \\n12/9/10                                                                                                                         AC 33.9 1-1 \\n 8 \\n      b.  Compliance by Similarity\\n:  Each category in this AC is defined as a test to be passed.  \\nHowever, in some cases you may be able to show §  33.91 compliance by similarity; by using test \\ndata from a previous engine type certification program.  You may use it to the extent that similarity exists between the component previously tested and your new component.  Similarity is normally shown through a relatively simple and direct comparison of the design features, and the operating characteristics and environment of the new component relative to the previously approved component.  Some guidelines are:           (1)  The new design must be within the scope of the previously approved design in all significant aspects, such as geometry, stress levels, limiting stress locations, operating characteristics, function, manufacturing processes, material properties, etc.           (2)  The engine and installation operating conditions and environment are similar or within the original design scope demonstrated by the original test.           (3)  The data from the original compliance finding is adequate to show compliance, so that no significant new data or analysis is required to show similarity.            (4)  We will not generally conclude that you have shown §\\n 33.91 compliance through \\nsimilarity if your claim is based solely on the use of previously successful design practices or field service histories on similar engine models or components.             (5)  You cannot show §\\n 33.91 compliance through showing similarity to a previously  \\napproved similarity finding.  Similarity must be shown to the original test data that demonstrated direct compliance.           (6)  Compliance may be based on test data collected using earlier version of the industry standard documents referred to in this AC (e.g., DO-160), if that test data shows compliance to the current guidance.       c.  Aircraft Installation\\n:  Testing under §  33.19, paragraphs (a) and (b) should consider aircraft \\ninterfaces where appropriate.  For example, lightning and EMI testing for electronic control components generally require that representive aircraft harnessing be installed to have a valid test.  Other components or systems may have other aircraft interface considerations.  Similarly, the expected installed environment (e.g., temperatures/pressures/flows) should be considered in test plan development.       d.  Test Set Up\\n:  Normally tests associated with §  33.91 compliance are conducted as bench or \\nrig tests.  However, certain components or systems may best be tested on an engine, provided that the requirements for that test category can be achieved.  \\n12/9/10                                                                                                                         AC 33.9 1-1 \\n 9 \\n \\n9.  Test Plans . \\n \\n     a.  Certification test plans should include the following information:           (1)  Applicable regulation(s) and purpose of test;          (2)  Component name(s) and operational description;          (3)  Part and serial number(s);          (4)  Part detail drawing(s) or sketch es (for example, to denote features of interest); \\n         (5)  Installation drawing(s) or sketches (for example, to describe installation in an engine); \\n         (6)  Conformity requirements;          (7)  Definition and range of component operating and environmental parameters;          (8)  Test equipment requirements (calibration and set-up);          (9)  Test methods and procedures;          (10)  Test pass/fail criteria;          (11)  Data recording methods; and          (12)  Deliverable test data.       b.  The certification test plan should contain, as a minimum, the information noted above, and should be FAA approved before conducting the test.  A copy of the approved test plan should be available at the test facility at the time of test.   \\n \\nFrancis A Favara, Manager, Engine and Propeller Directorate Aircraft Certification Service  \\n \\n12/9/10                                                                                                                         AC 33.9 1-1 \\n 10                            Appendix 1 \\n \\n \\nREFERENCES  \\n \\n 1.

PURPOSE . This advisory circular (AC) describes a comparative endurance test method to \\nsupport showing compliance of certain turbine engine or auxiliary power unit (APU) parts when \\nproduced under Parts Manufacturer Approval (PMA). This method may be used when PMA applicants introduce changes that could affect the durability of their proposed designs. It may also be used when an applicant has insufficient comparative data to show that the durability of their proposed PMA part is at least equal to the type design. The applicant can use this method when requesting PMA under test and computation, per part 21 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and using the comparative test and analysis approach detailed in Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Order 8110.42, Part Manufact urer Approval Procedures.  This method \\nsupports showing that the engine or APU still comp lies with part 33 or Technical Standard Order \\n(TSO) C77. \\n2. APPLICABILITY. \\na. This guidance is for applicants proposing a comparative endurance test for PMA of \\nturbine engine or APU parts that come in c ontact with the engine or APU gas flow path. \\nExamples of gas flow path parts include blades, vanes and shrouds. \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes an acceptable means, but not the only means, for showing compliance \\nwith the applicable engine or APU requirements using the comparative test and analysis approach for PMA under test and computations.  The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may elect to present.  Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance.  While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the relevant regulations.  On the other hand, if we become convinced that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance.  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n AC 33.87-2 6/25/09 \\nc.

FAA Order 8110.42C, Parts Manufacturer Approval Procedures; June 23, 2008. \\nb. AC 33.87-1, Calibration Test, Endurance Test and Teardown Inspection for Turbine \\nEngine Certification (§§ 33.85, 33.87, 33.93); April 13, 2006. 4. BACKGROUND. \\na. During the past several years, the FAA has evaluated several comparative endurance \\ntest plans in which PMA applicants proposed testing due to changes in materials, coatings, and \\ncooling designs. Those changes could affect part and as a result engine durability. We have also evaluated proposals made because complex manufacturing processes were involved and reverse engineering data was insufficient. Without suffici ent data, applicants could not substantiate that \\nthe durability of their proposed PMA part was at least equal to that of the type design. \\nb. Due to the increase in complex PMA test proposals, we are providing this guidance to \\nassist applicants in developing a suitable test for demonstrating the durability of their proposed PMA parts. This guidance uses the example of an engine turbine blade and associated requirements of § 33.87, but the approach for other gas flow path parts is similar (see  paragraph 7). \\n5. BLADE DURABILITY . Applicants must show that their proposed PMA blade is as \\ndurable as the type design blade when using the comparative test and analysis approach.  The \\nproposed PMA blade must be as durable as the type design blade when subjected to the same operational environment: the same rotational speeds, temperatures, airflow rates, and pressures associated with the location and function of the blade when installed. These operating conditions can cause blade thermo-mechanical fatigue, high cycle fatigue, oxidation, hot corrosion and reduce the blade creep rupture capability. Accordingly, one method of determining if the PMA blade has equivalent durability is to evaluate the blade after testing under the following requirements of § 33.87: \\na. Test values - see § 33.87(a)(3). Blade stresses are a function of the temperature gradient \\nwithin the blade, and the centrifugal and aerodynamic loads on the blade during engine operation. Thus, the stresses are greatest during engine acceleration from ground idle to 100% of the values (power or thrust, maximum permissible gas temperature and maximum permissible rotor speed) associated with the particular engine power or thrust operation being tested (see § 33.87(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3) and (b)(5)). \\nb. Cycles and time durations - see § 33.87(b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), and (b)(5). Engine cycling \\nbetween ground idle and the rotor speeds and gas temperature limits associated with its approved power or thrust ratings and back to ground idle can contribute to blade thermo-mechanical \\n2 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n    AC 33.87-2 6/25/09 \\nfatigue failure. Time-at-high gas temperature can cause oxidation, hot corrosion and reduce a blade’s creep rupture capability. \\nc. Incremental speed and running time - see § 33.87(b)(4).  Engine vibration can increase \\nblade stresses and affect blade high cycle fatigue capability.  Effects of engine vibration will vary with rotor speed and running time, with maximum blade vibration stresses occurring at resonant frequencies. \\nd. Starts - see § 33.87(b)(6). Engine starting conditions can affect blade durability. For \\nexample, cold start conditions can affect blade thermo-mechanical fatigue and tip wear.  In addition, false starts and restarts can affect blade protection systems like blade coatings and cooling configurations. \\n6. COMPARATIVE ENDURANCE TEST METHOD . This section outlines a comparative \\ntest method that supports showing that a PMA blade is at least as durable as the type design \\nblade. It applies those elements of § 33.87, such as speed, thrust, time at temperature and cycling, that affect blade durability. An alternate blade approach is discussed in paragraph 6.d. The appendix provides a graphical and tabular representation of the § 33.87 six-hour endurance \\ntest cycle. \\na. Test conditions . \\n(1) Operating values. Testing is at 100% of the engine rated power or thrust, maximum \\npermissible gas temperature, and maximum permissible rotor speed, either high rotor or low rotor as applicable, for each rating. These values are defined on the type certificate data sheet (TCDS) of the engine model on which the proposed PMA blade is eligible for installation. If multiple models are identified, the applicant must test the blades for the engine model with the highest rated values. If the TCDS does not define a separate maximum permissible rotor speed for the maximum continuous power or thrust rating, then the applicant must test the blades at the rotor speed defined for rated takeoff power or thrust during the hours and cycles prescribed in paragraph 6.a.(2). \\n(2) Hours and cycles. The following are the cycles and accumulated times associated \\nwith the engine power or thrust conditions. See Figure 2 in the appendix for a breakdown of the following: \\n(a) Rated takeoff power or thrust. A total of 180 cycles accumulating 18.75 hours \\nas prescribed in § 33.87(b)(1), (b)(2)(ii) and (b)(5). \\n(b) Maximum continuous power or thrust. A total of 120 cycles accumulating 45 \\nhours as prescribed in § 33.87(b)(2)(i) and (b)(3). \\n(c) Incremental cruise power or thrust.  At least 15 approximately equal speed and \\ntime increments between maximum continuous engine rotational speed and minimum idle rotational speed accumulating 62.5 hours.  If the engine exhibits significant peak vibration anywhere between the minimum idle and maximum continuous rating conditions, the applicant \\n3 \\n\\n   \\n \\n         \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  AC 33.87-2 6/25/09 \\nmust increase the number of increments as discussed in § 33.87(b)(4).  For each increment, we \\nrecommend applicants demonstrate a minimum of 10 million dwell cycles. \\n(3) Starts. Testing includes the sequence of engine starts prescribed in § 33.87(b)(6). \\n(a) Twenty-five cold starts. These starts require a cooling down period of at \\nleast two hours to allow the engine temperature to approach a stabilized test cell ambient temperature condition. \\n(b) Ten false starts, pausing for the engine’s minimum fuel drainage time, if \\nspecified, before attempting a normal start.   \\n(c) Ten normal restarts with not longer than 15 minutes since engine \\nshutdown. \\n(d) Fifty-five normal starts.  The applicant must include an appropriate \\nrationale if all of the remaining 55 starts are not proposed in its test plan. \\nb. Number of specimens. We recommend the following when determining how many type \\ndesign and proposed PMA blades the applicant uses to complete the blade set and establish the basis for comparison.  \\n(1) Type design blade. The applicant should consider testing at least 5 type design \\nblades from a minimum of 3 different batches for a total of at least 15 blades.  The applicant should select these blades from multiple manufacturing lots (batches) to capture as many blade variables as possible, including tolerance, manufacturing, and raw material sources.  To accomplish this, the applicant may need to obtain type design blades from different sources, at different times, or both.  This will help ensure that the normal range of population variation is achieved. Additionally, the type design blade samples should be zero-time blades acquired from approved traceable sources. \\n(2) Proposed PMA design. The remaining blades of the blade set should be new \\n(unused) proposed PMA blades manufactured using the PMA production process.  The applicant should test a sufficient number of PMA blades to ensure that production process variability is represented. \\nc. Pass/Fail criteria . The applicant should establish suitable blade inspection pass/fail \\ncriteria to compare the durability and functional ch aracteristics of the proposed PMA blades with \\nthe type design blades and associated mating hardware.  We recommend the following minimum criteria: \\n• Airfoil surface condition: missing coatings, evidence of high temperature-induced \\nerosion and oxidation, discoloration, or evidence of “necking” that may be caused by creep; \\n• Blade tip condition: evidence of heavy rubs, erosion, missing material, or cracking; \\n• Blade trailing edge: cracking, and high temperature induced erosion and oxidation; \\n• Blade height: creep; \\n4 \\n\\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n AC 33.87-2 6/25/09 \\n• Blade and disk retention features: fretting, cracking, or deformation on the blade \\nand on surfaces that contact the disk’s blade retention features; \\n• Blade pressure and suction surfaces: necking or other deformation that may also \\nindicate the onset of creep or temperature-induced deformation; \\n• Blade root fillet: cracking; \\n• Cooling hole condition: hole deformation, blockage, burned edges, or cracks \\nemanating from the holes, especially holes in or near the blade root fillet; \\n• Platform condition: deformation that may indicate an over-temperature condition, \\nlack of sufficient cooling, or excessive mechanical loads; \\n• Metallurgical evaluation to check for any over-temperature exposure; and  \\n• Inspections to evaluate any observed base metal cracking or other defects. \\n• If the blade employs a purging hole to clear internal debris, check to see if internal \\ndebris is purged or accumulated. \\n(1) Pre-test. Inspect all (PMA and type design) blade specimens to these criteria to \\nestablish a pre-test baseline for later comparisons.  Record the pre-test inspection results for all \\nblades. Identify and reconcile any non-conformances of the PMA blades and include that discussion in the test plan. \\n(2) Post-test. Repeat the pre-test inspection for all blade specimens and record post-\\ntest findings for both the type design and PMA bl ades.  Use the type design blade results to \\nestablish the range of variation in which the proposed PMA blades are expected to fall. If the variation of the PMA blade falls within that of the type design, then the PMA blade durability is considered equivalent. \\nd. Alternate equivalent blade comparative endurance test . The comparative endurance \\nengine test requirements presented in paragraph 6.a. may be modified.  For example, specific test conditions, such as the number of cycles, time at maximum permissible gas temperatures, power or thrust settings, vibration dwell segments and number of starts may differ.  The Larson-Miller method provides a means to develop alternative time-at-temperature test requirements of equal severity. Using this method, an applicant identifies the minimum metal temperatures at which blade creep, oxidation and hot corrosion can occur and adjusts the § 33.87 test times and temperatures to achieve equivalent exposure conditions.  \\n5 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n  AC 33.87-2 6/25/09 \\n7. COMPARATIVE ENDURANCE TEST METHOD FOR OTHER GAS PATH PARTS . \\nApplicants can develop a comparative endurance test method for other gas path parts to show \\ntheir proposed PMA part is at least as durable as the type design. The test method must allow for a meaningful comparison of the performance and durability characteristics of the proposed PMA part relative to the type design part and should consider the standards of § 33.87 or TSO C77. When doing so, the applicant should provide a rationale for any associated endurance test requirements, in either § 33.87(a) and (b) or TSO C77b sections 6.3.2, 6.3.3 and 6.3.5, proposed as unnecessary for the comparison.  \\n//signed by Peter A.

Initiated By: ANE-111 Change: \\n1. Purpose . This advisory circular (AC) provides guidance and acceptable methods, but not \\nthe only methods, for demonstrating compliance with the rotor strength (overspeed) requirements of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) 33.27. \\n2. Applicability . \\na. The guidance provided in this document is directed to engine manufacturers, modifiers, \\nforeign regulatory authorities, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engine type \\ncertification engineers and their designees. \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations. The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may elect to present.  Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used.  While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the relevant regulations.  On the other hand, if the FAA becomes aware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance.   \\nc. This material does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n3.

AC 33.70-1, Guidance for Aircraft Engine Life-Limited Parts Requirements, July 31, \\n2009. \\n5. Definitions. For the purposes of this AC, the following definitions apply: \\na. Approved Dimensional Limits . The maximum allowable dimensional growth at various \\ndisk locations that does not result in a hazardous condition. These approved dimensional limits, \\nalso known as “acceptable growth limits,” support the selection of the actual serviceable limits versus rotor overspeed level established within the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA) under § 33.4. \\nb. Burst Margin . The minimum rotor burst speed divided by the maximum permissible \\nspeed. This ratio is expressed as a percentage. \\nc. Engine Module. Each fan, compressor and turbine is considered an engine module.  An \\nengine may have several modules, such as a High Pressure Compressor (HPC), High Pressure Turbine (HPT), Intermediate Pressure Compresso r (IPC), Intermediate Pressure Turbine (IPT), \\nLow Pressure Compressor (LPC), and Low Pressure Turbine (LPT). \\nd. Extremely Remote . Failure conditions having a probability of occurrence in the range \\nof 10\\n-7 to 10-9 per engine flight hour. \\ne. Maximum Permissible Rotor Speed . The maximum approved rotor speed, including \\ntransients, for the maximum approved rating, including emergency ratings. \\nf. Rotor . An individual stage of a fan, compressor, or turbine assembly (some assemblies \\nmay consist of only one stage), including but not limited to bolted or welded assemblies. \\ng. Rotor Integrity . The capability of a rotor to withstand the overspeed conditions defined \\nin § 33.27. \\nh. Sample Rotor . A test rotor or rotor assembly (including, for example, coverplates, \\nspacers, or blade retention devices) that meets the following criteria: \\n(1) Represents the standard to be certified; and \\n(2) Has known material properties and dimensions. \\ni. Shaft System . The system of components that transmits torque between the disk driving \\nflange or shaft attachment members of the system that produce power (for example, the turbine) and the system that uses this power (for example, the compressor, fan or propeller).  Although the shaft system transmits mainly torsional loads, it consists of all rotating parts necessary for the rotor(s) to perform their function, whether or not such parts transmit torque.  Therefore, the shaft system may include, but may not be limited to, the following:  \\n(1) Drive shafts; \\n2\\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n 7/18/11 AC 33.27-1A\\n \\n(2) Gears; \\n(3) Gearboxes; \\n(4) Rotor wing arms;  \\n(5) Stub shafts; and \\n(6) Rotor hubs. \\n6. Objectives.   The safety objectives of the overspeed (strength) requirements ensure that the \\nrotors: \\na. Possess sufficient strength with a margin to burst above certified operating conditions \\nand above failure conditions leading to rotor overspeed; and \\nb. Do not exhibit a level of growth or damage that could lead to a hazardous condition, \\nsuch as fire, uncontainment, or loads greater than the ultimate loads of the engine mounts. \\n7. General. \\na. The applicant may comply with the overspeed (strength) requirements by using the \\nrequired tests and/or necessary analysis to meet the objectives identified in paragraph 6 of this \\nAC. \\nb. The demonstration of compliance with §§ 33.27(a) and (d) may be made separately, or \\nbe combined, as described in this AC. \\nc. Sections 33.27(a) and (d) allow various means of compliance (“tests, analysis or a \\ncombination”) in order to meet the objectives identified.  The applicant must propose the appropriate means of compliance, in accordance with the guidance defined in this AC. \\nd. The applicant should define and validate the analysis techniques necessary to support \\ncompliance with § 33.27 before use.  The applicant should base the calibration and validation of the analytical techniques on prior overspeed tests which may include the current rotor being certified. An analysis is considered validated if it can accurately: \\n(1) Predict rotor burst speed; \\n(2) Identify the rotor stage with the lowest burst margin within each engine module; \\nand \\n(3) Predict the dimensional growth versus rotor speed at critical rotor locations. \\ne. Any assumptions made during the testing or analysis should be conservative. \\n3\\n\\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  7/18/11 AC 33.27-1A\\n \\nf. Any analysis approach allowed under § 33.27 should be defined and validated before \\nusage. \\ng. The applicant should submit the appropriate substantiation to determine which of the \\noverspeed conditions listed in § 33.27(b) is the most critical for each individual rotor stage with \\nrespect to the requirements of § 33.27(a).  This substantiation should consider the entire flight envelope. A similar analysis should be submitted with respect to the requirements of § 33.27(d). \\nh. If deliberate blade shedding is used to limit the maximum overspeed: \\n(1) The conditions of §§ 33.27(b)(3) and (b)(4) apply to a fully bladed rotor at the \\nshedding speed; and \\n(2) The analysis to determine the most critical overspeed condition of §§ 33.27(b)(3) \\nand (b)(4) with respect to rotor integrity should consider blade shedding throughout the flight envelope. The blade failure speed should consider an adverse combination of dimensional tolerances, temperatures, and material properties of the blades and rotor.  Consequently, the most critical speed with respect to rotor integrity might  not coincide with the highest achievable blade \\nshedding speed. \\ni. If blade shedding or turbine blade/vane meshing and clashing is used to limit the \\nmaximum attainable overspeed, the applicant must demonstrate the following by test, analysis, or a combination of both:  \\n(1) The maximum attainable overspeed; and  \\n(2) That a hazardous engine condition does not occur at such a speed. \\nj. While considering the most adverse combination of dimensional tolerances and material \\nproperties, as required in §§ 33.27(a) and (d), the applicant should also consider the tolerances and material properties of other components that adversely influence stress levels in the rotor, such as the overspeed limiter or blades. \\nk. For each individual rotor stage, the applicant must consider the most adverse \\ncombination of temperature and temperature gradients possible throughout the entire operating envelope. \\nl. The appropriate percentage rotor speed of § 33.27(b) should be applied after making the \\nnecessary speed adjustments for temperatures, material properties and tolerance effects.  The necessary speed adjustments for temperature and material properties will normally be established on the basis of appropriate ratios of material properties. \\nm. Failure conditions which are sudden and transient (reference §§ 33.27(a) and (d)) are \\ntypified by loss of load failures, i.e., character ized by high rates of acceleration and deceleration \\nwith no dwell period at the highest overspeed attained. The applicant should examine all possible failure conditions to determine if any case exists which would result in a dwell period at \\n4\\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/18/11 AC 33.27-1A\\n \\nspeeds close to that of the transient short duration failure condition. If such a case exists, the \\napplicant should determine which condition is the most critical with respect to rotor integrity. \\nn. The analysis to determine the highest rotor overspeed during failure conditions needs to \\nconsider the worst case control system response time including system tolerances. \\no. When several rotors are of similar design, are made of materials to the same \\nspecification, and subjected to similar stress conditions, temperature levels and gradients, applicants may demonstrate compliance to § 33.27(a) by testing only the most critical rotor with respect to burst. This requires determining the burst speed for each rotor to select the most critical rotor, which has the smallest margin to burst above the speeds specified in § 33.27(b).  For multistage rotors in which the rotors do not meet the conditions of similarity as described above, applicants should substantiate compliance of each rotor stage with § 33.27 by using representative test data. \\np. Appropriate testing, or analysis based on testing, should establish the burst speed of \\neach fan, compressor, and turbine rotor stage in relation to the most critical condition prescribed in § 33.27(b). The certification documentation should report these speeds.  These burst speeds should be based on the most adverse combination of dimensional tolerances, temperature, and material properties. \\nq. The most critical rotor with respect to burst might not be the most critical rotor with \\nrespect to growth. To determine the most criti cal rotor with respect to growth for compliance \\nwith § 33.27(d), the applicant should consider the c onsequences of rotor growth if the rotor was \\noperating in an engine. \\nr. The consequences of rotor growth sufficient to cause significant contact or \\ndisplacement between engine components should be assessed to determine if the requirements of § 33.27(d)(1) can be met. \\ns. When determining compliance with the requirements of § 33.27(d)(2), the applicant \\nshould consider whether the rotor would exhibit any condition likely to prevent the safe operation of the engine in service following any failure or combination of failures considered under §§ 33.27(b)(3) or (b)(4). This period of time might equal that required to recognize the event and shut the engine down or to that required for continued safe flight and landing.  The length of time might also depend upon the operating instructions for an overspeed event. \\n8. Acceptable Means of Compliance. The following is an acceptable method for \\ndemonstrating compliance with the rotor overspeed requirements of § 33.27.  If the applicant \\nchooses to use this method of compliance, the applicant must conform to the guidance in this AC. \\na. The applicant must test the most critical  stage of each rotor module (fan, LPC, IPC, \\nHPC, HPT, IPT, LPT) on a rig or engine at the conditions necessary to demonstrate that a minimum strength rotor would meet the requirements of §§ 33.27(a) and (d). \\n5\\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/18/11 AC 33.27-1A\\n \\nb. Compliance to § 33.27(d) requires that each rotor which has been subjected to single or \\ndouble failure event of §§ 33.27(b)(3) or (b)(4) must not exhibit conditions such as cracking or \\ngrowth which preclude continued safe operation. The applicant must determine the magnitude of rotor growth which will occur during the overspeed events of §§ 33.27(b)(3) and (b)(4) and if that growth can be safely tolerated by the engine as described in paragraph 7(s) above. \\nc. An analytical modeling method based on representative test data may be acceptable \\nprovided that: \\n(1) the model has been validated by comparison with results from specimen and rotor \\ntests; \\n(2) its use is limited to rotors with material, geometry, stress, and temperature \\nconditions encompassed by those used to construct the model; and \\n(3) its predictions show that the certification standard rotor is not more critical, with \\nrespect to burst and growth, than any similar rotor for which substantiation has been demonstrated both by rotor test and model prediction. \\nd. Any test may be continued to rotor burst after the required time duration by increasing \\nthe rotor speed until the rotor bursts. If the a pplicant chooses this method, then the applicant \\nshould show that: \\n(1) the sample rotor was initially run at conditions not less severe than those required \\nfor compliance with § 33.27(a), and \\n(2) Section 33.27(d) can be complied with using an approved analytical modeling \\nmethod. \\ne. The engine control devices, systems, and instruments referred to in § 33.27(e) are \\nusually provided in modern engines by overspeed protection or circuits which, although they may be independent devices, are generally part of the electronic engine control system.  One acceptable method for demonstrating reasonable assurance of the functionality of the protection systems or circuits is to test them with a built-in test equipment (BITE) test or a periodic functional test. For the overspeed protection system, the BITE test should test 100% of the electrical/electronic part of the protection system.  The applicant may use a periodic functional test for the mechanical or actuating part of the overspeed system. \\n9. Factors to be Considered when Determining Test Conditions. \\na. Temperature.  The applicant should establish temperatures and temperature gradients by \\ntemperature surveys on an engine or by deriving them from a validated analysis.  Adjustments of \\ntest speed or blade mass or both should be applied to compensate for any deviation from the required temperatures and temperature gradients.   The rotor temperatures required by § 33.27(b) \\nare as follows: \\n6\\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n 7/18/11 AC 33.27-1A\\n \\n(1) For §§ 33.27(b)(1) and (b)(2), the material temperatures and temperature gradients \\nequal to the most adverse that could be achieved when operating in the engine at the required \\nrating condition. \\n(2) For §§ 33.27(b)(3) and (b)(4), the material temperatures and temperature gradients \\nequal to the most adverse that could be achieved when operating in the engine at the required rating condition immediately prior to the failure(s). \\nb. Sample Rotor Material Properties.   \\n(1) The applicant should determine the material properties of the sample rotor from \\nattached test rings/bars. \\n(2) When attached test rings/bars are not available to determine the material properties \\nof the sample rotor, the applicant should establish a value for the material properties. The applicant may establish this value by assuming the sample rotor possesses material properties are equal to known average properties of similar rotors  from the same manufacturing process lot.  If \\nusing this method, the applicant must also show that this assumption regarding material properties is valid within acceptable confidence limits.  Such limits should be based on the same statistical methods used to define the average and minimum material properties used in the design of the rotor. \\nc. Dimensional Tolerances.  Analysis of dimensional tolerances should be made to \\nidentify the most adverse combination with respect to the integrity of the rotors. \\n10. Failure Cases. \\na. Introduction. Sections 33.27(b)(3) and (b)(4) state the test speeds at which the rotor \\nstructural integrity requirements must be demonstrated for all engine ratings during single or \\ndual engine failure conditions. Examples of a single engine failure condition are a failure of a control system or shaft failure that can cause an overspeed condition.  With respect to combinations of failures, at any rating, if the likelihood of a combination is not greater than “extremely remote” (see definition above), the case need not be considered. \\nb. Loss of Load Events. \\n(1) To determine the highest overspeed resulting from a loss of load event to be \\nconsidered under § 33.27(c), applicants should consider, for all possible failure locations, factors such as system inertia, available gas energy, whether the rotor is held in the rotational plane, and overspeed protection devices. \\n(2) Applicants cannot exclude the failure of the shaft system when considering single \\nfailure events. However, applicants can provide engineering assessments supporting their finding that certain locations on the shaft system are not required for failure assessment when complying with § 33.27(c).  \\n7\\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n 7/18/11 AC 33.27-1A\\n \\n(3) When addressing loss-of-load events (that is, any failure of the shaft system that \\neffectively uncouples the turbine from its load), the applicant, according to § 33.27(c), must \\ndetermine the highest terminal speed of the roto r resulting from a failure of any segment of the \\nshaft system.  This failure must be assessed at all flight segments that describe a complete flight cycle. Once the highest terminal speed is determined, the applicant should design and demonstrate that disks have 5% margin above that speed.  \\n(4) The following guidance describes two acceptable approaches for determining the \\nmaximum terminal rotor speed for shaft failure cases when complying with §§ 33.27(b)(3) and (b)(4). \\n(a) For any component or element that forms part of the rotor shaft system, \\nidentify all single point failures that can lead to an overspeed condition and determine by test the resulting terminal rotor speed.  The applicant may use analysis if it has sufficient validation to prior testing or service events. \\n(b) If the applicant proposes to exclude certain shaft element(s) from failure \\nconsideration in determining the terminal rotor speed, the applicant must show by engineering assessment that failure of the excluded shaft element(s) cannot be expected to occur during the life of the engine.  The applicant must establish the structural integrity criteria used for this assessment on a case-by-case basis.  In general, the assessment should:  \\n1 Identify and consider all failures that can lead to an overspeed condition. \\nExamples of shaft element failure modes include, but are not limited to: fatigue (LCF/HCF), torsional overload; bearing failure; shaft rub; overtemperature; and loss of rotor centerline.  The assessment should also include failure or combinations of failures in the surrounding environment (including mating or adjacent hardware) that could result in failure of the shaft element(s).  The assessment of the environment should take into account possible wear, corrosion, fire, and contact with adjacent components or  structure that could lead to the failure of \\nthe shaft element(s). \\n2  Show that the shaft element(s) complies with the requirements of § 33.70. \\n3  Show that the material and design features of the shaft element(s) are well \\nunderstood, as evidenced by significant test and service experience with parts of similar design.  \\n4  Show that any stress and failure analysis methods used are adequately \\nvalidated. \\n5  Identify the effect on the shaft of loads which could be transmitted by shock \\nloading resulting from, for example, bird strikes or blade failure. \\n6  Identify any assumptions regarding engine installation.  Installation \\nassumptions should be noted in the Installation Instructions required by § 33.5. \\n8\\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n 7/18/11 AC 33.27-1A\\n \\n(5) Shaft system elements meeting the agreed-upon criteria can be excluded from \\nconsideration. The applicant would then determine the maximum terminal rotor speed from the failure of the remaining shaft system elements. \\nPeter A.

PURPOSE .  This advisory circular (AC) provides guidanc e and acceptable methods, but not \\nthe only methods, that may be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements contained \\nunder Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), part 33, §§ 33.78(a)(2), and 33.78(c).  Section 33.78(a)(2) requireme nts pertain to the operation of turbine engines in extreme \\nrain and hail, and § 33.78(c) pertains to engines installed on supersonic airplanes.  While the guidelines in this AC are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and industry experience in determining compliance with the requirements. \\n \\n2.  BACKGROUND.  In 1988, the Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) initiated a study of \\nairplane turbine engine power -loss and instability phenomena that were attributed to operating in \\ninclement weather.  AIA, working with the Association European des Constructeurs de Materiel Aerospatial (AECMA), concluded that a potential flight safety threat exists for turbine engines installed on airplanes when operating in an extreme  rain or hail environment.  AIA and AECMA \\nfurther concluded that the rain and hail ingestion requirements contained in § 33.77 did not adequately address these threats.  Consequently, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the Joint Aviation Authori ties (JAA) have promulgated additional rain and hail ingestion \\nstandards.  \\n \\n3.  DEFINITIONS .  The following terms are defined for the purpose of this AC. \\n \\n a.  Auto -recovery systems.  Auto- recovery systems typically include auto -relight \\nsystems, stall recov ery systems, or any other engine system intended to recover the operability of \\nan engine following a flameout or surge/stall. \\n   \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n \\n b.

DISCUSSION.  The arrangement of this  AC is in five Sections.  Section 1 provides an \\noverview of the power -loss and instability phenomena associated with operating airplane turbine \\nengines in extreme rain or hail.  Section 2 elaborates on some of the turbine engine design \\naspects that affect engine operability in rain or hail.  Sections 3 and 4 describe acceptable methods for demonstrating that the engine type design will operate acceptably throughout its operating envelope when exposed to the identified rain and hail threats.  Finally, Section 5 provides guidance relative to § 33.78(c), titled, Engines for Supersonic Airplanes. \\n        \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n       \\n    Para 3          Page 3  \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n \\nSECTION 1.  POWER -LOSS AND INSTABILITY PHENOMENA \\n \\n5.  GENERAL .  There have been mult iple engine power -loss and instability events, forced \\nlandings, and accidents attributed to turbine engine malfunction in extreme conditions of rain or hail.  Investigations have revealed that ambient concentrations of rain and hail can be amplified signif icantly through the engine core at certain combinations of flight speed and engine power or \\nthrust condition.  In some instances, the resulting increased amounts of ingested rain and hail have been sufficient to produce engine anomalies such as surging, power loss, and engine flameout. \\n \\n6.  METEOROLOGICAL DATA.  Appendix B, defines the atmospheric conditions of rain and \\nhail for the purpose of establishing certification test standards.  Note that the water concentrations defined for rain and hail in Appendi x B represent ambient conditions, not test \\nconditions at the engine inlet.  \\n \\n7.  RAIN AND HAIL CONCENTRATION AMPLIFICATION AND ATTENUATION \\nEFFECTS.  During in- flight encounters with rain and hail, changes in engine power or thrust and \\nflight speed can alter the rain or hail concentration within the engine for any given atmospheric rain or hail content.  \\n \\n a.  Scoop Factor Effect (Refer to FIGURE 1 -1).  The inlet -capture stream tube for airflow \\nvaries widely across the spectrum of engine power and flight spee d.  At low engine power and \\nhigh flight speed, the air intake requirements are minimal in comparison to the available ram air.  Consequently, a significant portion of the air in front of the inlet spills outside the inlet lip (see FIGURE 1 -1).  The scoop f actor increases with decreasing engine speed and increasing aircraft \\nspeed.  This factor occurs due to the increase of inlet airflow spillage, resulting from a smaller captured air stream tube.  Due to their mass, large rain droplets and hail are relativel y unaffected \\nby this spillage, and will be captured by the inlet.  The inlet area will establish the amount of rain or hail captured through the inlet.  The amount of this amplification effect is equal to the ratio of the nacelle inlet water capture area ( Ah) to the stream capture tube, air capture area (A c).  \\nBypass turbofan engines may have an additional internal scoop factor effect due to the divergence of the engine core stream tube from the nacelle inlet to the core inlet at low engine power and high f light speed.  Therefore, the scoop factor effect generally results in concentration \\namplification, the amplification is greatest when high flight speed is combined with low power or thrust.  \\n     Page 4          Para 5  \\n \\n02/08/2000         AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n \\n b.  R elative velocity centrifuging effects .  Some of the rain and hail will be centrifuged \\naway from the engine core by a fan and, to a lesser extent, away from the engine by a propeller.  This beneficial effect is dependent upon the fan or propeller geometry a nd rotational speed, inlet \\ndesign and location, engine design, aircraft velocity, and on the size of the rain droplets and hailstones.  \\n \\n  (1)  Turbofan and turbojet engines (Refer to FIGURE 1- 2). \\n \\n   (a)  Rain .  The inlet diffusing flow field pressure gradients act to shear large \\ndroplets into small droplets that decelerate and enter the fan at velocities close to the inlet air velocity.  As shown in FIGURE 1- 2, the majority of droplets that enter the engine at gas path \\nspeeds will strike the fan and be cen trifuged away from the engine core.  The forces acting upon \\nthe rain droplets in -flight will vary with airplane velocity and altitude.  A portion of the rain \\ndroplets entering the engine may have sufficient mass, such that deceleration to gas path velocity  \\nis not possible.  At low engine rotational speeds and high flight speeds, the velocity of the large rain droplets, relative to the fan, may allow that portion of the rain droplets to pass through the fan without impact (refer to hail velocity vector diagram in FIGURE 1 -2) and could possibly \\nresult in higher water concentrations in the engine core. \\n                    Para 7          Page 5  \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n \\nAir spillage\\nAc = Air capture areaAh = Water capture area\\nAh Ac\\nScoop Factor = Ah / Aclow rpm,\\nhigh a/cspeed\\nhigh rpm,\\nlow a/cspeed\\n \\nFIGURE 1 -1. Scoop Factor  \\n \\nFIGURE 1 -1:  The first drawing shows the inlet air spillag e at low engine rpm/high aircraft \\nspeed increases engine face water/air ratio, and the second high engine rpm/low aircraft speed decreases engine face water/air ratio by reducing air spillage.  \\n \\n   (b)  Hail .  Hail particles will maintain their size and will not be significantly \\naffected by the engine inlet flow field.  Consequently, the hail particles will enter the engine close to aircraft speed.  At low engine rotational speeds, a significant portion of the hail particles (similar to large rain droplets) may pass through the fan without impact (see FIGURE 1- 2) and \\ncould possibly result in high hail concentrations in the core. \\n \\n  (2)  Turboprop engines . \\n \\n   (a)  Rain .  When compared to a turbofan engine, the inlet flow field effect of \\nthe propeller on both the droplet size and the relative velocity centrifugal effects are reduced because of the lower solidity of the propeller.  Conducting this type of test without the propeller, either by using  \\n   Page 6          Para 7  \\n \\n02/08/2000         AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n some other load- absorbing device or running the gas generator alone, normally results in an \\nadded degree of conservatism.  Unlike turbofan engines, the propeller rotational speed does not vary significantly in flight, regardless of power setting.  Therefore, any beneficial effect of the propeller will remain reasonably independent of altitude and power setting.  Where an inlet particle separation system is incorporated, credit may be taken for its characteristics.  \\n \\n   (b)  Hail .  As with rain, the effects of the  propeller on hail ingestion are \\ngenerally considered beneficial, since it reduces the effective core concentrations.  Therefore, conducting a hail test without the propeller should result in an added degree of conservatism.  Another consideration is the e ffect of the propeller spinner.  In a continuous hail encounter, the \\nspinner may redirect hail into the general area of the engine intake.  The trajectory of this material will influence the effective inlet concentration to the engine, and should be included in \\nany supportive analysis for other than full -scale powerplant tests.  \\n \\n     V hail\\n  V gasVh\\nail rel. to fan\\nV\\nsmall\\ndrop rel to fanV fan\\n \\n*  Rain Breaks Up Into Smaller Droplets as They Slow in Inlet    *  Hail Not Affected/Slowed    *  Hail Enters \\nBooster With Near Perfect Match of Blade    *  Rain (Small Droplets) Centrifuged Away From Booster, Less Enters \\nCore  \\n \\nFIGURE 1 -2.  Velocity Vector Diagram  \\n \\n8.  ROTORCRAFT TURBINE ENGINES .  For rotorcraft applications, testing to the \\nrequirements of § 33.78(a)(2) may be replaced by the static rain ingestion test specified in § \\n33.78(b).  While it may be possible to define in- flight rain and hail ingestion concentration \\namplification and attenuation effects for rotorcraft installations in a similar manner to airplane \\ninstallations, the effects are ty pically small.  When rotorcraft applications are compared to \\nairplane applications, the proportionately \\n \\nPara 7           Page 7  \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n higher engine power setting during descent, and the lower flight speeds of the rotorcraft resul ts \\nin a small scoop factor effect.  Rotorcraft turbine engines may not have rotating components that centrifuge rain or hail away from the engine.  While differences in centrifuging capabilities between static test conditions and flight operations is an im portant consideration for turbofan \\nengines, it typically has no applicability to rotorcraft turbine engines.  Consequently, increasing the ambient rain concentrations in Appendix B to four -percent water (droplet flow to airflow) by \\nweight, will usually com pensate for any flight effects.  \\n \\n9.  TURBINE ENGINE OPERABILITY EFFECTS .  As stated previously, rain and hail ingested \\ninto a turbine engine can be at greater than ambient concentrations in the engine when at certain combinations of flight speed and engine  power condition.  Ingestion of water through the engine \\ncore can produce a number of engine operational anomalies, including compressor surge, power or thrust loss, and flameout.  These operational anomalies are partly a result of the changes in the therm odynamic cycle of the turbine engine because of the ingestion of water during rain or hail. \\n \\n a.  Compressor rematch .  The presence of rain or hail particles, or water from melted hail \\nin the gas path, causes the compressor to assume new operating conditio ns.  The net overall \\neffect may result in an increase to the compressor operating line, with a corresponding decrease to the compressor surge line and stall margins.  \\n \\n b.  Engine control response (Refer to FIGURE 1- 3).  As shown in FIGURE 1 -3 of this AC, \\nthe fuel control steady- state operating line will move upward toward the acceleration schedule as \\nthe amount of ingested rain or hail increases.  A higher operating line means that more fuel is required to sustain steady -state operation.  When the operating line coincides with the \\nacceleration schedule, the fuel control may be unable to deliver additional fuel to accommodate the increasing rain or hail ingestion.  Under this condition, the engine may run- down and could \\nresult in sub -idle engine operation, a loss of throttle response, or flameout. \\n          Page 8           Para 8  \\n \\n02/08/2000         AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n \\nH I GH  RO TO R SPEEDFUEL / AIR RAA CCELERA TI O N  SCH EDU LE\\nS TEADY S TATE DRY OPERATING LINWET\\n \\n \\nFIGURE 1 -3.  Typical Engine Control Characteristics  \\n \\n c.  Combustor response .  The evaporation in the combustor of liquid water resulting from \\nthe ingestion of rain or hail, will cause a reduction in combustor flame temperature and will adversely affect combustor performance.  The reduced temperature will result in slowing of the chemical reaction rate and inh ibit complete combustion, further resulting in reductions of both \\ncombustor efficiency and stability.  Typically, the combustor is most susceptible to flameout when it is required to operate at a sub -idle operating condition.  Therefore, a flameout conditi on \\nmay be preceded by an engine run- down, as discussed previously in paragraph 9.b. \\n \\n10.  CASE CONTRACTION.  As rain or hail is ingested into the engine, the temperature of the \\ncompressor case may decrease at a faster rate than the compressor rotor.  This would result in a reduction in compressor blade tip clearances, and may result in blade tip rubs.  Turbine engine types, such as turbojets that have a significant scoop factor effect, but lack design features to direct rain or hail away from the engine cor e (e.g., fan blades, bypass splitter, etc.), may be more \\nsusceptible to damage resulting from case contraction.  \\n         Para 9          Page 9  \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n \\nSECTION 2.  DESIGN FACTORS  \\n \\n11.  GENERAL .  The response of a turbine engine to a  rain or hail encounter depends on a \\nnumber of design and operational factors.  The manufacturer can greatly improve the operability of the engine during an extreme rain or hail encounter by incorporating certain design features.  However, there may be a compromise between some of these design features.  For instance, a spinner designed to maximize hail rebound and rain droplet centrifuging, may also result in a spinner which is more susceptible to large ice accretions.  \\n \\n12.  DESIGN FEATURES .  With knowledge of the power -loss and instability phenomena, the \\napplicant can incorporate design features that increase the engine\\'s tolerance to rain and hail.  \\n \\n a.  Fan blade or propeller design and operating speeds .  The fan blade or propeller, under \\nthe right condi tions, can effectively centrifuge small droplets of rain away from the engine core.  \\nHail particles and large droplets of rain can also be centrifuged or deflected away from the engine core by the fan blade or propeller, but with considerably less effectiveness.  The applicant should consider the relative velocity effects at the critical points when establishing fan blade or propeller geometry and operating speeds. \\n \\n b.  Spinner or nose cone .  A spinner or a nose cone can effectively deflect rain and hail \\naway from the engine core.  Designing the spinner or nosecone to maximize hail deflection, \\nrequires knowledge of the post impact trajectory characteristics of hail particles.  \\n \\n c.  Bypass splitter .  In the case of turbofan engines, increasing the gap betwee n the fan \\nblade trailing edge and the bypass splitter generally tends to enhance the benefits to the engine core from the centrifugal effects of the fan blade.  \\n \\n d.  Engine air bleeds .  Engine air bleed ports provide a direct means of redirecting or \\nextracting rain and hail away from the engine core, and a direct means of improving compressor surge and stall margins.  The effectiveness of the bleed in extracting liquid water or hail particles out of the engine core will depend on; the radial distribution of  the water or hail particles, the \\nlocation of the bleed, the bleed entrance geometry, and the bleed control logic.  Also, in the case of hail, the bleed should be designed to minimize the likelihood of clogging and blockage. \\n    Page  10         Para 11  \\n \\n02/08/2000        AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n \\n e.  Engine and aircraft accessory loads.  Accessory loads will tend to move the fuel control \\noperating line closer to the acceleration schedule.  Therefore, accessory loads should be minimized where possible while in rain and  hail conditions. \\n \\n f.  Fuel control .  Fuel controls that schedule fuel using a rate change of compressor speed, \\nshould provide a consistent acceleration and deceleration thrust response during rain or hail ingestion. \\n \\n g.  Variable stator vane.  The sched ule of the compressor variable stator vanes directly \\nimpacts the compressor performance, operability, and stability characteristics.  Weather related sensing or scheduling errors may cause a loss of surge or stall margin.  \\n \\n13.  OPERATIONAL FACTORS .  With knowledge of the power -loss and instability \\nphenomena, the applicant can establish an operating envelope that minimizes the power -loss and \\ninstability threats.  \\n \\n a.  Increased power levels.  Increasing engine power or thrust setting (i.e., throttle advance)  \\nwill increase rotor speeds and air intake requirements.  This is beneficial because an increase in rotor speed will tend to improve centrifuging, while an increase in airflow will tend to decrease the adverse scoop factor effect.  The combustor stability margin will also be improved with an increased power setting.  \\n \\n b.  Avoidance of engine transients .  Avoidance of engine transients improves the stall and \\nsurge tolerance of the engine and reduces the likelihood of run- down.  However, avoidance of \\nthrottle  transients should not be used by the applicant to show compliance with the rain and hail \\ningestion requirements. \\n \\n c.  Decreased flight speeds.  Reduced aircraft speed, like increased power levels, is \\nbeneficial because it improves centrifuging while decr easing the adverse scoop factor effect.  \\n          Para 12          Page 11 \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n \\nSECTION 3.  CRITICAL POINT ANALYSIS  \\n \\n14.  GENERAL .  Compliance with the requirements of § 33.78(a)(2) is a two- step procedure.  \\nThe first step is to identify, through analysis, the critical operating points for rain and hail ingestion.  The second step is to test the engine at selected critical points to validate the engine\\'s capability to adequately withstand extreme rain and hail encounters.  The applicant should develop a critical point analysis and submit the analysis to the appropriate FAA Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) for concurrence, prior to rain and hail ingestion testing.  \\n \\n15.  CRITICAL POINT ANALYSIS ELEMENTS.  The purpose of the critic al point analysis is \\nto identify operating points within the engine flight envelope where operability margins are minimized due to the presence of rain or hail.  The analysis should encompass the full range of \\nall pertinent variables.  These variables incl ude, but are not limited to:  \\n \\n a.  Atmospheric conditions .  The rain and hail threats identified in Appendix B, FIGURE \\nB1 and Tables B1 through B4, should be used for determining the critical atmospheric \\nconditions used in the critical point analysis.  The  critical point analysis should consider the \\neffects of nominal, as well as extreme levels of rain or hail on the function of all relevant engine components and systems. \\n \\n b.  Rain and hail concentration amplification and attenuation effects .  The critical  point \\nanalysis should quantify the amount of rain and, separately, the amount of hail ingested into the engine core.  Therefore, amplification and attenuation effects, such as the scoop factor effect and relative velocity effect should be quantified.  Thi s may necessitate assessing a representative \\ninstallation aerodynamic flow field and probable flight profiles.  In the case of rain ingestion, droplet breakup characteristics need to be established or conservatively assessed.  In the case of hail ingestion , the trajectories of hail particles after impacting nose cones, spinners, inlet \\nsurfaces, blades, and vanes etc., need to be established or conservatively assessed for determining critical points.  \\n \\n c.  Engine power level .  The entire envelope of power conditions should be analyzed.  \\nWhile run -down and flameout are predominantly low power anomalies, compressor stability \\nproblems could occur at high power. \\n \\n d.  Engine parasitics.  The variability of engine parasitics, such as air bleeds and accessory \\nloads , should be analyzed for their effect on the critical points. \\n   Page 12         Para 14  \\n \\n02/08/2000        AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n \\n16.  CRITICAL POINT ANALYSIS PROCEDURE .  The critical point analysis is an assessment \\nof the engine\\'s capability throughout its operati ng envelope, given the range of event variables \\ndescribed above and any engine operability condition which is affected by ingested rain or hail.  Typical operability conditions to consider include; surge and stall margin, fuel control run- down \\nmargin, combustor flameout margin, and instrumentation sensing errors.  The critical point analysis should also address case contraction.  \\n                         \\n        Para  16          Page 13 \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n \\nSECTION 4.  COMPLIANCE METHODS  \\n \\n17.  GE NERAL .  An engine compliance test method consistent with the critical point analysis \\nmay include the use of a ground- level static facility.  This method should include appropriate \\nmeans to conduct engine tests during simulated rain and hail ingestion at the increased concentrations.  This would simulate in- flight rain and hail scoop factor concentration \\namplification effects, and compensate for the differences between the critical point conditions and the ground level test conditions.  Other possibilities f or demonstrating compliance include; \\nwind tunnel testing, direct core water- injection tests, component rig tests, scale model tests, and \\nanalyses.  \\n \\n18.  TEST POINT SELECTION .  The critical hail point(s) and rain point(s) that yield the least \\noperability ma rgin should be demonstrated by engine ingestion testing.  Additional test points \\nshould be considered if any of the operability margins are determined to be minimal (e.g., compressor surge and stall, combustor blow out, fuel control run- down, instrumentati on sensing \\nerrors, etc.).  \\n \\n19.  CRITICAL POINT TESTING AT GROUND LEVEL .  The applicant may test the engine at \\nground level conditions, provided the relevant engine operational factors of the critical points are reproduced in a relevant manner. \\n \\n a.  Test compensation.  The applicant should compensate for differences between the \\ncritical point conditions and the test facility conditions.  These differences may include:  \\n \\n  (1)  Air density .  The critical point percentage of rain and hail concentration by \\nweight should be reproduced during the test.  For example, 20 g/m 3 of rain at 20,000 feet is \\napproximately three -percent water by weight.  At sea level, this percentage of water requires \\nnearly 40 g/m 3 to compensate for the higher air density (Refer to Appendix B, FIGURE B1).  \\n \\n  (2)  Scoop factor .  The appropriate rain and hail concentration amplification due to \\nthe scoop factor effect should be applied to further increase the quantities of rain and hail for the ground level tests.  Determining this effect nec essitates having knowledge of the inlet diffusing \\nflow field throughout the engine power or thrust range and flight envelope. \\n     Page 14         Para 17  \\n \\n02/08/2000        AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n \\n  (3)  Engine rotational speeds .  The low rotor speed for the ground level test should \\nbe no greater than the altitude critical point condition.  This is particularly important for turbofan engines since rotational speed determines the rain and hail centrifuging effects which prevent some of the rain and hail from reaching the engine core.  The rain and hail concentrations may be adjusted to compensate for any necessary deviation from critical point rotational speeds.  \\n \\n  (4)  Variable systems.  All variable systems, such as engine bleeds, whose position \\ncan affect engine operation in rain and hail, should be set in the position associated with the critical point.  \\n \\n  (5)  Engine power extraction.  It should be shown by analysis or test that sufficient \\nmargin exists for extraction of the representative electrical or shaft power  loads and service air \\nbleeds.  \\n \\n  (6)  Thermodynamic cycle differences.  There may be thermodynamic cycle \\ndifferences between the test point and the critical point, which affect the operability of the engine.  There should be compensation for these cycle differences, or it should be shown that these differences provide additional conservatism.  \\n \\n  (7)  Enthalpy of water .  Rain and hail concentrations may be adjusted to ensure that \\nthe heat extraction resulting from their ingestion are the same as the critica l point.  If the \\ningestion of liquid water droplets is accepted (see paragraph 20 of this AC for compliance alternatives) for critical hail point testing, then the water concentration should, as a minimum, be increased to compensate for the heat of fusion of ice.  \\n \\n  (8)  Rain droplet breakup.  In the ground level test environment, forces applied to \\naccelerate the simulated rain droplets to flight speed, as well as shear forces between the droplets and the engine airflow, are likely to break up the droplets.  This breakup can result in reduced conservatism due to additional centrifuging by the fan or propeller and spinner.  The concentration of the rain may need to be increased to compensate for the added centrifuging resulting from ground level testing. \\n \\n b.  Engine test facility .  The engine test facility should provide a uniform water droplet or \\nhail spatial distribution within the critical area of a geometric plane within the engine inlet.  These uniform spatial distributions need to be agreed to by the appropriate FAA ACO.  The facility should also provide proper droplet or particle sizes, and proper velocity distributions, unless otherwise justified, in accordance with Appendix B. \\n  Para 19          Page 15 \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n \\n c.  Instrumenta tion.  Instrumentation and data sampling rates should be sufficient to \\nestablish; rain and hail temperature and concentrations, particle velocities and size distributions, and engine response.  Primary exhaust water to air ratio measurements, by way of gas  sampling \\nshould be considered.  Instrumentation accuracy and repeatability should be demonstrated by suitable means.  \\n \\n d.  Test procedure .  The test procedure should consider the following for operability \\ncritical point tests, and for the thermal shock (rain only) critical point test: \\n   (1)  Stabilize the engine at the critical point conditions.  \\n   (2)  Take steady -state data readings before introducing rain or hail. \\n   (3)  Start continuous transient data recording prior to initiation of rain or hail flo w. \\n   (4)  Establish altitude equivalent rain or hail flow at proper inlet velocity and size \\ndistribution.  \\n   (5)  Conduct operability critical point tests at the following steady -state conditions:  \\n    (a)  Deliver rain for a minimum of three minutes, at the altitude equivalent \\nconcentration defined in Appendix B, FIGURE B1 and Table B1.     (b)  Deliver hail for a minimum of 30 seconds, at the altitude equivalent \\nconcentration defined in Appendix B, FIGURE B1 and Table B2.    (6)  When testing low power cr itical points (i.e., minimum flameout and/or run -down \\nmargin), conduct tests with ingestion at the following transient conditions:  \\n    (a)  Accelerate the engine with one- second throttle movement to rated takeoff \\npower or thrust from the minimum rotor spee d defined by the critical point analysis. \\n    (b)  Decelerate the engine with one- second throttle movement from an \\nappropriate power or thrust setting (e.g., 50- percent rated takeoff power or thrust) to the \\nminimum rotor speed defined by the critical point  analysis.  \\n  Page 16         Para 19  \\n \\n02/08/2000         AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n    (c)  If test conditions or test facility limitations prevent transient testing as \\ndefined above, the applicant may propose alternative test criteria.  This alternative test criteria must provide test criteria (and any complementary substantiation) which validates that the engine \\nhas sufficient operability margins to account for likely flight operations such as missed approaches (i.e., go- around) and likely throttle movements during des cent.  \\n   (7)  Conduct the thermal shock critical point test by delivering rain for three minutes \\nat the critical power or thrust condition, following a normal stabilization period without water ingestion.  The maximum rain ingestion rate should occur withi n five seconds from onset. \\n \\n e.  Probable factors .  It should be demonstrated by test or analysis, that the engine tested in \\naccordance with paragraph 19.d. of this AC would have operated acceptably if exposed to other probable factors associated with a rain or hail encounters.  These other probable factors would include, but are not be limited to; typical engine performance losses, installation effects, and typical auto -throttle power excursions. \\n \\n f.  Acceptance criteria.  Acceptable engine operation excl udes flameout, run- down, \\ncontinued or non- recoverable surge or stall, or loss of acceleration and deceleration capability.  \\nA momentary surge or stall that arrests itself without operational intervention (e.g., without throttle manipulation) is usually acc eptable (see paragraph 19.f.(1), below).  If, after the test, it is \\nfound that damage has occurred, further running or other evidence may be required to show that subsequent failures resulting from the damage are unlikely to occur before the damage is rectified.  Engine performance should be measured before and after the rain and hail ingestion \\ntests to assess steady state performance changes.  Data should be normalized according to the applicant\\'s standard practices, and the evaluation of sustained loss or  degradation of power or \\nthrust should encompass the full range of engine power or thrust.   \\n \\n  (1)  Use of auto -recovery systems during certification testing .  Auto- recovery \\nsystems typically include auto -relight systems, stall recovery systems, or any ot her engine \\nsystem intended to restore operability of an engine following a flameout, surge or stall.  Although auto- recovery systems do not need to be disabled during rain and hail certification \\ntesting, a test result that indicates that the auto -recovery system interceded to  \\n     Para 19          Page 17 \\n  \\nAC 33.78- 1         02/08/2000 \\n \\n recover from a flameout, even a momentary flameout, would be an unacceptable result.  This is also true for unrecoverable surges, stalls or run -downs.  Engine systems that preemptively \\nprepare the engine for operation in inclement weather via  control system or variable geometry system reconfigurations, may be enabled during rain and hail certification testing.  \\n    (a)  A momentary flameout of only one to two seconds duration may be \\nconsidered acceptable if it can be shown that it is unnoticeable to the flight crew and does not affect aircraft operation.  Additionally, if a momentary flameout does occur, an analysis should be performed to account for the worst case combination of engine bleeds, component performance, and expected transients, to show an adequate relight margin in all configurations and expected conditions.  If compliance to these criteria is dependent upon the functioning of an auto- recovery system, then availability of this system is considered critical for dispatch and \\nshould therefore have a higher standard of reliability.  Since the rule precludes flameout, then this momentary flameout would necessarily need to be analyzed and potentially reviewed against, a nd potentially accepted to part 21, paragraph 21.21(b)(1), as an equivalent level of \\nsafety, if it is judged to meet that criteria, and should be so notated on the Type Certificate Data Sheet.  \\n \\n  (2)  Sustained power or thrust loss .  As a result of the test, any  shifts or errors in \\nmeasured thrust or power, which occur against the primary thrust or power set parameter(s) (i.e., fan speed, engine pressure ratio, torque, shaft horsepower), should be limited to three -percent for \\naircraft safety.    \\n \\n  (3)  Po wer or thrust degradation .  A change of engine corrected thrust or power of up \\nto 10- percent from rated or pretest levels, excluding the primary thrust or power setting \\nparameter, is acceptable provided the criteria for sustained power or thrust loss is met.  This change in performance is based on the applicant’s standard performance parameters (e.g., exhaust gas temperature, rotor speed, etc.).  \\n \\n20.  OTHER COMPLIANCE ALTERNATIVES .  Analysis may be used in place of, or in \\ncombination with, engine testing to demonstrate compliance with the requirements.  The analytical methods used should have a sufficient validation basis to justify the accuracy of the predictions, or be shown to yield conservative results.  The amount of validation (e.g., engine test, rig test, experimental test, etc.) should be proportional to the complexity of the analytical methods used, and to the criticality of the particular calculation to the prediction of engine operability.  \\n  Page 18         Para 19  \\n \\n02/08/2000        AC 33.78- 1 \\n \\n \\nSECTION 5.  GUIDANCE ON ENGINES FOR SUPERSONIC AIRPLANES  \\n \\n21.  GENERAL .  This Section provides additional guidance to the requirements of § 33.78(c), \\ntitled, Engines for supersonic airplanes.  This additional guidance is intended to outline an acceptable h armonized compliance plan which is consistent with the intent of JAR -E 790(c), \\nwhile not altering the requirement or intent of § 33.78(c). \\n \\n (1)  Compliance requirements .  In addition to complying with paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) \\nof § 33.78, a separate supersonic airplane engine test is required to be conducted with three hailstones ingested at supersonic cruise velocity, except as otherwise noted in § 33.78(c). \\n \\n (2)  Operating conditions .  The engine’s rotor speeds, component loadings, and component \\ntemp eratures for this test should be representative of supersonic cruise flight operation.  \\n \\n (3)  Hailstone ingestion sequence .  The hailstones should be ingested in a rapid sequence \\nto simulate an in -flight hailstone encounter. \\n \\n (4)  Alternate large hailston e option.  Section 33.78(c) allows an alternate hailstone test \\nwhere three large hailstones may be ingested in a rapid sequence at subsonic velocities.  It should be shown that for this alternate subsonic test, the ingestion is equivalent to the applicable  \\nsupersonic ingestion with respect to engine component loadings and strengths, the kinetic energy of hailstones and their depth of penetration into the engine. \\n   /s/ \\nThomas A.

Purpose .  This advisory circular (AC) provide s guidance and acceptable methods, but not the \\nonly methods, for demonstrating compliance with the Extended Operations (ETOPS) eligibility \\nrequirements in accordance with Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 33.  Specifically, §§ 33.4, appendix A, A33.3(c), Inst ructions for Continued Airworthiness; \\n33.71(c)(4), Lubrication System ; 33.90(b), Initial Maintenanc e Inspection; and 33.201, Design \\nand Test Requirements for Early ETOPS E ligibility, are addre ssed by this AC.  \\n \\n2.  Applicability \\n \\n     a. The guidance provided in this AC is di rected to engine manufacturers, modifiers, foreign \\nregulatory authorities. \\n \\n     b.  This material is neither mandatory nor  regulatory in nature a nd does not constitute a \\nregulation.  It describes acceptabl e means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations.  We will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance \\nthat an applicant may elect to present.  Terms such as \"should,\" \"shall,\" \"may,\" and \"must\" are \\nused only in the sense of ensuring applicability of  this particular method of compliance when the \\nacceptable method of compliance in this documen t is used.  While these guidelines are not \\nmandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining \\ncompliance with the relevant regulations.  If we decide that following this AC would not result in \\ncompliance with the applicable regulations, we are not bound by th e terms of this AC, and we \\nmay require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance. \\n \\n     c.

General .  This AC provides guidance on acceptable methods of compliance to the applicable \\nregulations.  Compliance with these regulations  does not result in an ETOPS type design \\napproval for the engine model, but  does provide type design eligibility for engines to be installed \\non ETOPS airplanes in accordance with § 25.1535.  Compliance with these regulations is not \\nnecessary to obtain a type certificate for the engine model, but is required for an airplane/ engine \\ncombination to meet § 25.1535.  For ETOPS eligible  models, the Type Certificate Data Sheet \\n(TCDS) for the engine should contain a not e describing the mode l\\'s ETOPS status.  \\n \\n5.  Early ETOPS Eligibility - §  33.201. \\n \\n     a.  General.  The overall intent of § 33.201 is for engine manufacturers to demonstrate that \\ntheir engine design minimizes the likelihood of an engine or propulsion syst em caused diversion.  \\nThe rule applies to engines intended for instal lation in two-engine ETOPS airplanes that will be \\nETOPS-approved using the Early ETOPS method in part 25, a ppendix K, K25.2.1.  Compliance \\nwith § 33.201, along with the maximum diversion time demonstrated, should be noted in the engine TCDS.   \\n \\n     b.  Section 33.201(a) Design Quality Process.   \\n \\n         (1)  This section requires that y ou use a design quality proce ss that includes your proven \\nbest design and manufacturing practices, and knowledge obtaine d from field service lessons \\nlearned.  The purpose of this requirement is to eliminate from your engine model known failure, \\nmalfunction, or design related maintenance error problems relevant to ETOPS.  Such problems \\ninclude loss of thrust control, in-flight shutdow n (IFSD), or other power loss events that have \\noccurred in your other relevant FAA type certificated engine models.  \\n \\n         (2)  You may show that your design complies with this section by showing that your design \\nquality assurance process can eliminate from new models those causes of engine failures, malfunctions, and design related maintenance problems that occurred within your commercial engine experience base.  \\n \\n     c.  Section 33.201(b) Design Features.  \\n \\n         (1)  This section requires that  your engine type design address known failures, \\nmalfunctions, and maintenance problems that have resulted in in-flight shutdown, loss of thrust control (LOTC) or other power loss, and that could affect ETO PS operations.  Events occurring \\nduring taxi or maintenance ground runs must be included, if such an event could have occurred \\nin-flight.   \\n \\n         (2)  We will apply a 10 year experience limit if you support your assessment with adequate historical data for that time period.  If your database is inadequate, we will decide what \\nadditional data is required for the experience  assessment of § 33.201(b), based on the following: \\n \\n 2\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\n              (a)  Your level of experien ce in certifying engines in stalled on transport category \\nairplanes, \\n \\n              (b)  Your recent experience certifying new engines, \\n \\n              (c)   Your design practices  and manuals used in development of new engines, and \\n \\n              (d)  Any other f actors that you may choose to present to us. \\n \\nNote :  This additional or alternative data may go back farther than 10 years, and \\nmay also include any data necessary to show equivalent experience. \\n \\n         (3)  You must also show how y ou prevented the problems identified in § 33.201(a) from \\nrecurring in your new engine model. \\n \\n     d.  Section 33.201(c) Cyclic Endurance Test.   \\n \\n         (1)  You must subject your engine to a cyclic endurance test .  This test utilizes a \\nconservative test cycle to help identify problems or failures that might not otherwise occur when \\ncomplying with the basic certificat ion test requirements of part 33.  You may conduct this test in \\nany ground or altitude test facil ity acceptable to us.  The test is generally conducted with the \\nengine in the installed c onfiguration [reference § 25.1535, a ppendix K, K25.2.2(d)], which \\nrequires coordination between the manufacturer and installer .   \\n \\n         (2)  Test Considerations.  Table 1 provides guidance for several common situations for \\ndetermining when an endurance test is required.  New type certificates normally require a test.  \\nAmended type certificate actions may or may not, depending upon the level of similarity to \\nexisting models and the amount of related se rvice experience accrued.  For follow-on engine \\nmodels, the following are important when deciding on the need for testing, to the extent that \\nthese items contribute to system dynamics or the vibratory signature of the engine: \\n \\n              (a)  Assessing mechanical size or stiffness changes; \\n \\n              (b)  Major structural changes; \\n \\n              (c)  Changes in the dynamics of the engine; \\n \\n              (d)  Change s to bearing spaci ng and arrangement; \\n \\n              (e)  Changes to the number of structural frames; \\n \\n              (f)  Changes to th e engine mounting arrange ment to the aircraft; \\n \\n              (g)  Change s to external configuration hardware; \\n \\n              (h)  Changes to the number of compressor or turbine stages; \\n 3\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\n \\n              (i)  Changes to the diameter or mass of the fan; \\n \\n              (j)  Changes to engine contro l system architecture (for example, supervisory to full \\nauthority type, or analog to digital); \\n \\n  (k)  Changes to installation (for exampl e, service bleed and power extraction); and \\n \\n  (l)  New technology (for example, design, materials or manufacturing processes). \\n \\nTABLE 1 - Engine Design and Installation Considerations for Cyclic Endurance Testing \\n \\nSCOPE OF \\nCHANGE \\n TYPE \\nCERTIFICATE RATINGS AND \\nLIMITATIONS BASIC \\nENGINE \\nDESIGN \\nFACTORS 2CYCLIC \\nENDURANCE \\nTEST  \\n(§ 33.201(c)) \\nNew engine1 \\n New New New Yes \\nDerivative engine\\n3Could be new or amended Either may be changed or unchanged and \\nmay be more \\nsevere Could change, but not \\nextensively  Yes, for the \\npropulsion system of the aircraft if \\nengine design \\nfactors\\n2 or system \\ndynamics4 change \\nrelative to baseline, such \\nthat the original \\ntest is not fully representative of the proposed model. \\n \\n \\nMajor design \\nchanges5No model \\nchanges No change No change No \\n \\n \\nNote 1 :  Typically an engine model for which an application for a new type \\ncertificate is made in accordance with 14 CFR part 21.  This model type is \\ngenerally the first type in a new family/s eries of engines.  However, for some \\nprograms, a new engine could be adde d to an existing type certificate. \\n \\nNote  2 :  Engine design factors include, but  are not limited to, mechanical size \\nand stiffness, static structure (bac kbone), dynamics of engine, bearing \\narrangement, number of structural fram es, mounting arrangement to aircraft, \\n 4\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\nnumber of compression and turbine stages, and size and diameter of the fan, to the \\nextent that these contribute  to the system dynamics (s ee Note 4) of the engine. \\n \\nNote 3 :  A derivative engine is a closely rela ted follow-on model to an existing model \\nfamily, and often involves new ratings a nd limits, product or technology improvements, \\nminor or major design changes, and a new ai rcraft application.  This model type is \\nsometimes the first in a new series of mode ls within an existing type certificate. \\n \\nNote 4 :  System dynamics of the engine is the vibratory response signature \\n(system critical frequencies and amplitude s).  These can be a function of engine \\nmass and stiffness, rotor speeds, and engi ne or aircraft mount and strut mass and \\nstiffness. \\n \\nNote 5 :  In general, major design changes follo wing the initial ETOPS eligibility granting \\ndo not require a 33.201(c) cyclic endurance test , but do need to be evaluated for ETOPS \\nsuitability.  For such change s, enhanced type certifica tion work (other then a 33.201 \\ncyclic endurance test) may be required to cl early show compliance with the applicable \\npart 33 and part 25 requirements, and to show acceptable IFSD reliability for ETOPS \\noperations.  These major changes will be ev aluated by the FAA on a case-by-case basis.  \\nThe engine manufacturer s hould also coordinate with the installer concerning the \\npropulsion system installation re quirements for ETOPS.  Therefore, major design change \\napprovals should include a determina tion that the IFSD rates required by § 21.4(b) will be \\ncomplied with in a service environment.  For minor design changes, their scope is generally small compared to the baseline type design, and the normal type certification process adequately covers those ch anges for continued ETOPS eligibility.\\n \\n \\n         (3)  Maintenance.  Maintenanc e performed while on test should be conducted in \\naccordance with the Instructions for Con tinued Airworthiness (ICA), required under  \\n§ 33.4.  Validation of maintenance procedures for ETOPS significant systems are required under part 25, appendix K, and testing required under § 33.201 is normally \\nsubject to this requirement.  The engine manu facturer should coordina te with the installer \\nin this regard.  \\n \\n     e.  Section 33.201(c)(1) Test Cycle.  The test cycle depends on the intended mission and \\naircraft application, as follows:  \\n \\n         (1)  Start-Stop Cycles.   \\n \\n              (a)  \"Represe ntative\" service start-stop cycle, as used in the rule, is a representative mix \\nof full rated and de-rated takeoff thrust missions th at represent typical operations expected in the \\nfirst two years of service for the specific mode l.  The representative mission mix should consider \\nairplane installation, operator and route structure effects. The various missions should be \\nuniformly distributed over the course of the te st.  Your proposed test  start-stop cycle should \\ninclude the following flight profile segments:  ground idle, taxi, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent \\n(minimum idle), approach (approach idle and gl ide slope intercept), and landing (including thrust \\nreverse if applicable for the insta llation).  In addition to the noted flight profile segments, the test \\n 5\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\ncycle should include engine start and shutdown.  For engine shutdown, the main rotors speeds \\nshould not be greater than that due to wind milling rotation due to prevailing ambient wind \\nconditions.  Lastly, a minimum of 50 cold starts should be included in the test, where cold is \\ndefined as the engine being shut down for a minimum of 3 hours.  \\n \\n              (b)  Your mix of rated thrust  should include the maximum rated takeoff thrust, de-rated \\nthrust as applicable, and maximum continuous thrust.  By operating the engine from the \\nminimum thrust to the maximum rated thrust, plus  estimated use of de-rate thrust, your engine \\nwill be subjected to the full operating range expected for the airplane during the first two years of \\noperation.  Note the takeoff rating used for this test must be th e highest takeoff rating for which \\nETOPS eligibility is sought for a family/series of engines.  Any applicable thrust de-rates should \\nbe evaluated similarly.  \\n \\n              (c)  The test conditions must include typical engine bleed extraction (aircraft bleeds, \\nanti-ice bleed, etc.), and power ex traction (hydraulic loads, electri cal loads, etc.) expected during \\nthe typical phases of flight ope ration.  Approximately one-third of the 3000 test cycles should be \\nperformed with the engine anti-i ce bleeds active if engine air blee d anti-ice systems are used.  In \\ndeveloping the start-stop cycle profile, you must coordinate with ai rframe applicants to ensure \\nthe correct mission, thrust mix, bleeds, and power extractions are properly defined.  \\n \\n              (d)  Simulated Diversions.  \"S imulated diversions\" as used  in the rule means you must \\nconduct three simulated diversions to the maxi mum diversion time (minutes) for which early \\nETOPS eligibility is sought at maximum con tinuous rated power or thrust (MCT).  The \\nsimulated flight diversions must include typical engine bleed extraction (a ircraft bleeds, anti-ice \\nbleed, etc.), and power extracti on (hydraulic loads, electrical loads, etc.) expected during a \\ndiversion.  The simulated diversions should be approximately equally sp aced apart during the \\nendurance engine test; however, the last simulate d diversion must be conducted within the last \\n100 cycles of the test.  Note the MCT rating used for this test must be the highest MCT rating for \\nwhich ETOPS eligibility is sought for a family/series of engines.  \\n \\n                   1.  You must conduct the simulated divers ions to the maximu m ETOPS single engine \\ndiversion time sought (for example, 180 mi nutes, 240 minutes, and 270 minutes).  The \\ndemonstrated diversion time mu st be described in the engine  TCDS.  The applicant should \\nconsider future operational se rvice needs in choosing the ETOPS diversion test time. \\n \\n                   2.  The three simulated diversion cycles  should include a 15 minute hold condition \\nand a one minute go-around condition at the end of each test cycle.  These additional conditions \\nsimulate the diversion profile assumed for ETOPS diversion route planning in § 121.646, and \\nhave been included in the ETOPS endurance test for past programs .  The power levels for the \\nhold and go-around conditions for this test are those associated with a typical one-engine \\ninoperative condition. \\n \\n                   3.   Note that § 121.633 requires a 15 minute margin for diversion route planning \\npurposes (that is, flying time margin to ETOPS Alte rnate Airport).  This requirement is based on \\nthe diversion profile assumed in § 121.646 (see Note  2 above), and will reduce the operator’s \\nallowable diversion time by 15 minutes relative to the airplane’s ETOPS Significant Systems \\n 6\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\ntime limitations.  Inclusion of the 15 minutes hol d and one minute go-around conditions into the \\nendurance test as recommended in Note 2 above, could allow an additional 15 minutes of type \\ndesign diversion authority to be applied to the propulsion system at the airplane level, when \\napplicable.  The engine TCDS will describe the de monstrated diversion time equal to the time of \\nthe MCT runs in the simulated diversion cycles plus the run time at a hold power condition.  The \\nengine manufacturer should coordinate with the installer in this regard, to assure that the \\nsimulated diversion cycles are c onducted to a diversion time cons istent with that desired for \\nservice.  \\n \\n     f.  Section 33.201(c)(2), Unbalance and Vibration Endurance.   \\n \\n         (1)  The engine\\'s low speed and high speed main rotors are to be independently unbalanced  to induce vibratory excitation greater than 90% of the applicant\\'s recommended field service \\nmaintenance vibration level(s).  This element of  the test will account for potential service use \\nunbalance operation.  The intermediate rotor of a three-spool engine is to be independently \\nunbalanced to greater than 90% of your reco mmended production acceptance level.  This \\nelement of the test will account for potential near maximum peak vibration levels of newly \\ndelivered engines.   \\n \\n         (2)  You must maintain these ro tor unbalance levels for the duration of the endurance \\ntesting, unless we approve a modification that accommodates unplanned vibration levels above \\nor below that specified in the rule.  The 90%  value as used above represents the minimum \\nequivalent vibration level to be demonstrat ed throughout the duration of the test.  We \\nrecommend that rotor unbalance at the start of th e test be 100% of the associated vibration limit \\nto minimize the potential for any excursions falli ng below the 90% minimum, or for the need of \\npenalty runs. \\n \\n         (3)  You must conduct periodic vibration surveys to verify the required levels of rotor unbalance are maintained throughout the endurance test.  These surv eys must be equally spaced \\n(+/- 50 cycles) and conducted at not more than 500 cycle intervals.  The surveys must cover the \\nentire operating speed range for each rotor for the highest thrust rating covered by this test.   \\n \\n              a. The survey peak vibration levels must be determined using a slow acceleration and \\ndeceleration run of the test engine (approxi mately two minute acceleration and two minute \\ndeceleration), covering the main engine ro tor operating speed ranges (minimum idle to \\nmaximum rated thrust rotor speed range for the test day ambient conditions).  The value of the peak vibration levels observed during these vibr ation surveys must meet the minimum specified \\nin the rule.  The maximum vibrati on level that is identified from the survey is defined as the peak \\ntracked order vibration (that is, peak channel hold once per rev vibration component), and is used \\nto calculate equivalent vi bration level amplitude.  \\n \\n              b. It is known that certain engine factor s can vary over the course  of the test, and this \\nmay influence the amplitude and speed of the peak vibration value between surveys.  The \\nobjective is to record the absolute peak for each rotor regardless of the rotor speed at which it \\noccurs for each survey.  This approach assumes the slow acceleration and deceleration vibration \\nsurvey method is representative of the vibratory response of the engine during the endurance test \\n 7\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\nand typical service operation.  If this slow accel/decel method is not representative of actual \\nengine operation, you should propose another method for our acceptance.  For example, some engines, especially when ope rated at higher imbalance leve ls, may exhibit short duration \\ntransient high vibration peaks during certain other accel/d ecel conditions.   \\n \\n              c. Another survey objective is to  identify the peak vibration le vel that would reliably be \\nobserved by a flight crew during nor mal operations.  It is importan t that accurate peak engine \\nvibration levels be displayed to the flight crew ; however flight deck vi bration display units and \\nscaling may differ from the endurance test paramete rs.  Any concerns that the flight deck display \\nunits/scaling would prevent the crew from observing a peak (for example, that used to assess the \\nequivalent amplitude), should be communicated to  the FAA and its implication assessed.    \\n \\nThe following equation, based on accelerated  testing damage accumulation, provides an \\nacceptable means to determine equivalent vibration level: \\n \\nAequiv = [Σ{Ci (A iα)/C}]1/α > 0.9 A target\\n \\nWhere: C i = Number of cycles between vibra tion survey observations (target is \\n500). \\n \\nAi = Average vibration amplitude for a single test increment, determined \\nby averaging the start and end maximum vibration amplitudes for a given increment C\\ni.  \\n \\nC = The target number of cycles (typically 3000). \\n \\nα = Constant equal to 5.68 based on industry experience with metallic \\nmaterials (may require adjustment for new or novel materials or applications).  If new or novel materials are proposed for engine rotor components, the applicability of this exponent will need to be assessed.  \\nSee appendix A for additional information.  \\n \\nAequiv = A constant value of unbalance am plitude at which the entire test \\ncould be run to produce the same cumulative damage that actually occurred during the test. \\n \\nAtarget = Target amplitude (for example, units in velocity, displacement, \\ngravitational forces, etc.) is 100% of the applicant’s recommended field service maintenance or production acceptance vibration levels, as \\napplicable. \\n \\n              (a)  At the completion of the te st, the value of A equiv must be equal to or greater than \\n90% of the target amplitude (A target)  in order to meet the requirements of § 33.201(c)(2).  \\n \\n              (b)  Minor adjustments in the rotor unbalance may be necessary  during the test in order \\nto meet the required average vibration level.  A lternatively, you may avoid engine disassembly to \\n 8\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\nadjust rotor unbalance if, using a method acceptable to us, you modify your test start-stop cyclic \\ncontent (but at least 3000 cycles must be run), or the number of cy cles per rpm step (up or down) \\nto accommodate a vibration level that is margin ally below 90% or above 100% of the vibration \\nlevel required in order to comply with § 33.201(c)(2).  \\n \\n              (c)  If A equiv falls below 90% of the target amplit ude, but above 85% at the end of the \\nstandard test, then the applicant can propos e to run additional penalty cycles at the  existing levels \\nof rotor unbalance to comp lete the test.  In running these penalty cycles, the test must accrue at \\nleast the cumulative damage that would have been  accrued if the test had been conducted at 90% \\nof the target vibration level.  The engine may not operate below 85% of target vibration during \\nthe penalty runs under this method.  Also under this circumstance, the manufacturer may propose \\nto redefine the [100%] recomme nded field service limit as equal to the demonstrated A equiv.  This \\nwould allow the test to be considered complete with no penalty cycles.  Or, alternatively, a new \\ntest could be conducted.   \\n \\n              (d)  If A equiv falls below 85% of the target amplitude  at the end of the standard test, then  \\nthe applicant can propose to run additional pena lty cycles to complete the test.  However,  rotor \\nunbalance must be increased to 90% or greate r to complete the te st under this method.   In \\nrunning these penalty cycles, the test must accrue at least the cumulative damage that would have \\nbeen accrued if the test had been conducted at 90% of the target vibration level.   \\n \\n              (e)  If the engine vibration levels measured during the test are exceeding 100% of A target, \\nthen the applicant may propose reduced dwell time for the remaining cycles so that the \\naccumulated damage does not exceed the accumulated damage associated with running the test \\nat 100% A target.  However 3,000 cycles total are still re quired.  Any reduction in dwell time will \\nbe based on the calculation of accumulated da mage, and can be claimed up to 105% of A target.  \\nNo credit will be given for damage accumulation for cycles conducted at vibration levels beyond \\n105% of A target. \\n \\n              (f)  The endurance test mu st include vibration endurance speed steps of 60 rpm \\nincrements of the high speed rotor\\'s operating range for the equivalent of three million (3E6) \\ncycles for steady-state rotor speed points that re present takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach, \\nlanding and thrust reverse (re ference § 33.201(c)(3)); and 300 ,000 (3E5) cycles for rotor \\noperational speed points in the range between fli ght idle and cruise (re ference § 33.201(c)(4)) not \\ncovered above.  A maximum 200 rpm incremental st ep size may be run with  the accumulation of \\n10 million (1E7) cycles for § 33.201(c)(3) and one million (1E6) cycles for § 33.201(c)(4) requirements.  The maximum and minimum rotor speed boundaries defining this operating range \\nmust be established on the limiting conditi ons for the representative mission mix of \\n§ 33.201(c)(1).   \\n \\n              (g)  The Maintenance Ma nual recommended vibration limits selected by the \\nmanufacturer and specified for this test should be based on test and past  experience, and their \\nsuitability should be evaluated as part of the test plan review.  \\n \\n     g.  Section 33.201(d), Calibration Test.  Prior to starting the endurance test, you must \\ncomplete an engine calibration test.  The purpos e of the calibration test is to establish the \\n 9\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\nengine’s power and thrust characteristics, whic h must meet approved ra tings within approved \\nlimits.  You will later compare thes e pre-test values to the resu lts of a second calibration test \\n(reference § 33.201(e)(1)) conducted at the end of the endurance test.   \\n \\n     h.  Section 33.201(e), Post-Test Inspection and Acceptance Criteria.  The endurance test \\nengine inspection and acceptance criteria are: \\n \\n         (1)  Section 33.201(e)(1), Takeoff Powe r or Thrust and Engine Op erating Characteristics.  \\nThe pre and post-test calibration results must be compared.  To  be within approved limits, the \\nengine must be able to produce rated takeoff power or thrust at a sea le vel hot-day corner point \\ncondition, without exceeding any operating limit s when operated in accordance with the \\noperating instructions required by § 33.5.  In additi on, the engine surge and stall characteristics \\nobserved over the test duration must be consis tent with the requirements of § 33.65.  Lastly, \\nestablished engine operating limits should not be  exceeded at any time during the conduct of the \\ntest.  \\n \\n         (2)  Section 33.201(e)(2), Visual Inspec tion at Test completion.  Th is inspection is intended \\nto document the engine condition with respect to the on-wing serviceabilit y limits in the ICA.  \\nThe inspection will also establish a correlation between the assembled engine condition and the \\ncondition of subassemblies and individual parts following the post-test disassembly.  \\n \\n         (3)  Section 33.201(e)(3)/(4), Hardware Inspection and Condition Disassembled.  Hardware inspections must be accomplished in accord ance with your ICA submitted under § 33.4, and \\nmust also be evaluated with respect to your design quality process and lessons learned data (reference § 33.201(a) and (b)).  Applicable ICAs for this in spection include the engine \\nmaintenance manual or section, and the engine ov erhaul manual or section, as identified in \\nappendix A to part 33.  Certain component ma intenance manuals (CMM) may also apply.   \\n \\n              (a)  Hardware conditions that c ould result in loss of thrust control, in-flight shutdown, or \\nother power loss within a period of operation befo re the component, assembly, or system would \\nlikely have been inspected or functionally tested fo r integrity while in service, are not acceptable.  \\nHardware conditions (including thos e not serviceable per the ICA) th at would not likely result in \\nthe above power loss events had the part remained in operation, may be acceptable.   \\n \\n              (b)  For unusual or unexpect ed outcomes, engineering judgment and experience are \\nnecessary to assess engine hardware condition.  For example, apparently minor hardware \\ncondition anomalies could be a precursor to a potentially majo r hardware condition should the \\nengine be subjected to more  operational time and cycles, or  a broader rang e of operating \\nconditions.  In addition, hardware distress caused by disassembly of the engine is not generally cause for failure of the test.  Parts considered e xpendable at disassembly, to  be replaced with new \\nparts at re-assembly (for example, certain fasten ers), are also not cause for failure of the test. \\n \\n              (c)  Your ICA must be revise d to address any hardware di stress condition not previously \\nincluded, but found as a result of the test.   \\n \\n 10\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\n              (d)  We will decide if your proposed hardware corrective action plan, if necessary, is \\nacceptable. \\n \\n6.  Initial Maintenance Inspection Test - §  33.90(b ).  This section describes a method for \\nutilizing the Early ETOPS § 33.201 test to show  compliance with § 33.90, initial maintenance \\ninspection (IMI).  Section 33.90(b) is intended to support establishment of the IMI required by \\n§ 33.90, by allowing use of the test conducted in accordance with § 33.201.  This method allows \\nyou to conduct a single test on one engine build to demonstrate compliance with both \\nregulations.  After completing the full number of test cycles re quired for an IMI test performed \\nin accordance with § 33.90(a), applicants may interrupt the § 33.201 test to conduct a complete \\non-wing or other inspection accep table to the FAA in order to  show compliance with § 33.90 \\nrequirements.  Please note that this method of compliance requires the § 33.201 test to be \\ncompleted in its entirety prior to entry into service (EIS).  If an interim IMI inspection is \\ncompleted and the Type Certificate is issued, failure to complete the remaining portion of the \\n§ 33.201 test is non-compliant with § 33.90(b) requi rements, unless otherwise approved by the \\nFAA.  An acceptable on-wing inspection must include, but is not limited to, the following:   \\n \\n     a.  Full borescope inspection of accessible gas path stages or areas of the fan, compressor, \\ncombustor, and turbine modules to the serviceable limits of the ICAs. \\n \\n     b.  For engine equipped with electronic co ntrols, observe and interroga te the system for fault \\nmessages and status messages, both current and prev iously recorded, to the serviceable limits of \\nthe ICAs. \\n \\n     c.  Inspect all oil system chip detectors and filters for contamination. \\n \\n     d.  Inspect all fuel system filters for contamination. \\n \\n     e.  Test (for example, spectrographic anal ysis) a sample of main engine oil for contaminants \\nthat might indicate impe nding internal failure. \\n \\n     f.  Conduct a complete visual inspection of the inlet, exhaust, and ex ternals to the serviceable \\nlimits of the ICAs. \\n \\n     g.  Conduct a power calibration to show the engine can produce rated power or thrust at a sea \\nlevel hot-day corner point c ondition within approved limits. \\n \\n     h.  The general pass/fail criteria are fully  serviceable in accordan ce with the ICAs, unless \\notherwise accepted by us. \\n \\nNote 1 :  Paragraph 6 (above) provides guidan ce relative to § 33.90(b).  For further \\ninformation on the overall method of complia nce, refer to AC 33.90-1, titled “Initial \\nMaintenance Inspection (IMI), 14 CFR § 33.90, Te st for Turbine Engines”, dated March \\n4, 2004. \\n \\n 11\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\nNote 2 :  Complying with § 33.90 via § 33.90(a)  requires use of maximum ratings \\nthroughout the § 33.90(a) test.  However, comp liance via § 33.90(b) accepts the mix of \\nratings allowed under § 33.201.  \\n \\n7.  Instructions for Continued Airworthiness - §  33.4, Appendix A, A33.3(c).  This regulation \\nrequires that you include special engine condition  monitoring procedures in the ICA maintenance \\nmanual if ETOPS eligibility is sought.  Also, this  regulation applies to all engine models to be \\ninstalled in ETOPS airplanes, re gardless of the number of engi nes installed or by what method \\nthe airplane will be approved for ETOPS.  The special monitoring procedures must allow the flight crew to determine, prior to flight, that  maximum continuous thrust and necessary bleed air \\nand power extraction levels are available simulta neously, within approved limits, for the relevant \\nengine inoperative ETOPS diversion.  For two- engine ETOPS airplanes, you must demonstrate \\nthat your proposed procedures can predict if the required thrust, and bleed air and power \\nextraction levels, are available for varying levels  of engine deterioration and varying ambient \\nconditions before we will grant ETOPS type design eligibility.   \\n \\nNote :  The engine condition monitoring proce dures required under this engine type \\ndesign regulation do not define all the el ements of a complete engine condition \\nmonitoring program that an operator may need to comply with under the operating \\nregulations (for example, parts 121 and 135).  The engine ICA should be clear in this regard. \\n \\n8.  Oil Tank Design § 33.71(c)(4) .  If ETOPS eligibility is sought, § 33.71(c)(4) requires that \\nyou design the oil tank to prevent a hazardous loss of oil if the tank cap is not installed or \\ninstalled incorrectly.  Also, this regulation applie s to all engine models to be installed in ETOPS \\nairplanes, regardless of the number of engines installed or by what method the airplane will be approved for ETOPS.  A hazardous oil loss includes a loss that could affect the safety of any portion of an ETOPS flight, includ ing diversion, had the cap instal lation error occurred on one or \\nmore engines.  An oil quantity loss that might result in or require that engine power be maintained below MCT, or the engine to be shut down, is considered a hazardous loss of oil.  \\nNote the intent is to prevent hazardous oil loss, not necessarily any oil loss (for example, a small \\nquantity determined to be non-hazardous may be acceptable).  The most common method to \\naccomplish this is inclusion of a check or flapper type valve in the oil fi ll feature of the tank.  \\nOther methods may be acceptable, such as a pressure fill port or any other design feature that will prevent the siphoning of a hazardous quantity of oil overboard.  Also, the rule is not \\nintended to allow compliance by maintenance pro cedure; the necessary p hysical features or \\ncharacteristics must be part of the oil tank or engine design, and should be shown to function per design intent.  In addition, incor poration of an oil tank quantity si ght glass would help reduce the \\nnumber of oil tank cap removals in service, and would indirectly support the overall safety intent \\nof this requirement.  Manufacturers should consid er such a feature.  Lastly, the ICA should \\ncontain inspection instructions for the feature(s) used for comp liance to this requirement, to \\nensure availability of these functions in a service environment when they are needed. \\n 12\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\n9.  Engine Rating and Limits - §  33.7.  For all ETOPS eligible models, a TCDS note should be \\nincluded to indicate eligibility.  For models that comply with  § 33.201 for Early ETOPS, the note \\nshould also describe the demonstr ated diversion time.  A sample note for each situation is shown \\nbelow: \\n \\n“Model xxx has complied with the requireme nts of §§ 33.4(A33.3(c)), and 33.71(c)(4), \\nand is therefore eligible for installatio n on Extended Operations (ETOPS) approved \\nairplanes.  Note that ETOPS eligibility does no t constitute airplane or operational level \\napprovals necessary to conduct ETOPS flights.” \\n \\nOR \\n \\n“Model xxx has complied with the requireme nts of §§ 33.4 (A33.3(c)), 33.71(c)(4) and \\n33.201, and is therefore eligible for installa tion on Extended Operations (ETOPS) and \\nEarly ETOPS approved airplanes.  The demons trated diversion time is xyz minutes at \\nMCT plus 15 minutes at hold power*.   Note that ETOPS eligibility does not constitute \\nairplane or operational level approvals  necessary to conduct ETOPS flights. \\n \\n*Note the hold condition run time if included in the simulated diversion cycles of the \\n§ 33.201 endurance test.” \\n \\n10.  Reliability Reporting for Two Engine Airplanes - §  21.4(b) .  \\n \\n     a. Reporting.  Section 21.4(b) applies to both airplane an d engine type certificate holders with \\ntwo-engine ETOPS fleets.  Section 21.4(b)(1) requires each type certificate holder to investigate \\nIFSD events and submit a periodic (monthly or quarterly as applicable) ETOPS report for each \\nETOPS two-engine airplane model type desi gn approved for ETOPS.  The report must be \\ntransmitted to the cognizant FAA aircraft certific ation office, and must contain the following \\ninformation: \\n \\n         (1)  IFSD rates (world fleet 12 m onth rolling averages; engine basic and total installed); \\n \\n         (2)  IFSD reports for the period (descrip tions/findings); and \\n \\n         (3)  ETOPS fleet utilization data  (operators, diversions, diversion time authority, \\nhours/cycles as available, etc.). \\n \\n     b. The world fleet IFSD rates include all operations of the ETOPS-approved airplane/engine combination, not just ETOPS flights.  The s ubmitted IFSD rate information may combine \\nmultiple engine models within a distinct fam ily that are installed on ETOPS airplanes, if \\nconcurred with by the FAA.  The IFSD reports should include a description of the event and \\ninvestigation results.  Note that reporting under § 21.4 can be combined with § 21.3 reporting, at \\napplicant discretion.  \\n 13\\n1/21/10          AC 33.201-1 \\n \\n \\n     c. Section 21.4(b)(2) defines the 12 month rolling average total IFSD  rates required for each \\nlevel of ETOPS airplane type design approval. These IFSD rates are the same as required under \\npart 25 (appendix K) for airplane ETOPS type design approval.  This sect ion also requires the \\ntype certificate holder to publish service information that will enable operators to maintain the required airplane/engine combination world fleet I FSD rates.  Service information can take the \\nform of Service Bulletins, Service Letters, Al l Ops Wires, etc., published as necessary.   \\n \\n \\nFrancis A.

Equivalent Amplitude Fatigue Exponent Determination  \\n \\na.  Discussion.  The Equivalent Amplitude Fatig ue Exponent has its origin in the S.S. Manson \\nMethod for Universal Slopes (1).  Manson demonstrated that the fatigue exponents for many \\nmetals could be averaged and used to develop a universal fatigue expone nt approximating either \\nthe low or high cycle capability of metallic ma terials.  Although Manson used the approach to \\ndevelop generic fatigue exponents representing a broad ra nge of metals, the approach has been \\ndemonstrated to be applicable to characterizi ng the fatigue exponent for individual materials too \\n(2)(3).  When the fatigue exponent is  combined with cumulative damage calculations, it can be \\nused to assess accelerated fatigue tests (4).  These various authors suggest the fatigue exponent \\nmay range from 4 to 20 depending on material an d whether high cycle or low cycle fatigue is \\nbeing evaluated.  These authors also indicate that metallic materials typically exhibit high cycle \\nfatigue exponents in the range of 4-8.  The FAA determined that 5.68 is an overall acceptable value covering a variety of current ly used turbine engine metals over a range of R-ratios for high \\ncycle fatigue.  If an engine design departs signi ficantly from the use of conventional metals, then \\na reevaluation of the exponent in accordance wi th the references below may be required.  \\n \\n1.

The requirem ents of § 33.63 apply to the engine, its com ponents, and system s operating \\nthroughout the declared flight e nvelope and ranges of rotation al speeds and power/thrust. All \\nengine com ponents are exposed to som e level of vibration, w hich depends on the com ponents’ \\ndesign characteristics, such as geom etry or m aterials, and the operating environm ent, such as the \\nsources of excitations or aerodynam ic forces. For exam ple, when excited, the engine com ponents \\nvibrate at specific frequencies a nd the am plitude response is speci fic to that com ponent and its \\noperating environm ent. Com ponents di rectly in the airflow, such as the blades or vanes, are \\nexcited by disturbances f rom the wakes of stators, vanes, struts, but also by inlet distortions and \\nother sources. Blades m ay also be subjected to vi bration driven by instabi lities su ch as  stall or \\nflutter. The am plitude of blade and vane  resonant response depends on damping and \\naerodynam ic forces. Other com ponents, like those installed on the engine case, are excited by \\nrotor unbalance and vibrate at frequencies associated with the source of excitation. \\n \\n b. Your dem onstration of com pliance with othe r part 33 regulations for which vibration is \\nexam ined may also provide substantiation for compliance with § 33.63. On the other hand, \\nengine vibration accepted or obs erved during compliance with othe r part 33 standards should be \\nverified against the engine vibr atory characteristics and vibrati on envelope for which compliance \\nwith § 33.63 is shown.  \\n \\n1.2. Definitions.  For the purpose of this  AC, the following definitions app ly: \\n \\n a. Critical com ponent. A com ponent whose fa ilure could result in a hazardous engine \\neffect.  \\n \\n b. Declared flight envelop e. All airborne  and non-airborn e conditions of op eration, \\nincluding start-ups and shutdowns.  \\n \\n c. Engine configuration. T he type design, in cluding the roto r unbalance speci fied in the \\nproduction specifications and the engine m anuals. \\n \\n d. Engine m anual(s). Manuals issued in  com pliance with §§ 33.4 and 33.5, including the \\nmaintenance m anual, ins tallation m anual, and operating instructions. \\n \\n e. Excessive vibration. Vibration that results  in m echanical failure, dam age or wear in \\nexcess of approved lim its or prevents the engine from  operating as intended. \\n  \\n f. External components (“extern als”). The com ponents of an en gine directly or indirectly \\nmounted on the engine exterior casing. Extern al com ponents are addressed in chapter 4 and \\ninclude : \\n \\n  (1) Com ponents and Accessories (“ C&As”). The in dividual co mponents an d \\naccesso ries that are part of the engin e and it s sys tems. Examples in clude: the Full Authority \\n \\nAC 33.63-1   7/25/07 \\nDigital Engine Control, Fuel Managem ent Unit, pumps, actuators, igniters, tem perature probes, \\nfilters, senso rs, or valves ; and the en gine accesso ries, su ch as the accessory gear box.  \\n \\n  (2) Engine system s. The various engine syst ems, such as the electrical, lubrication, or \\nfuel system s, which include C&As and associat ed com ponents. For exam ple, the fuel system  \\nincludes C&As like fuel pum ps, filters, and fl ow-m eters and com ponents like hoses, tu bes, \\nvalves, and connectors. Another example is th e electrical sys tem, which includes C&As (like \\ngenerators) and the connecting cables.  \\n \\n  (3) Assem bly hardware. The brackets, suppor ts, ducts, spacers, tubes, hoses, and all the \\nother assembly and clamping elements used to attach, m ount, or connect C&As and engine \\nsystem s. For the purposes of this AC, we are referring only to assem bly hardware th at are \\nsensitive to engine vibration a nd whose failure would interfere w ith the functional and structural \\ninteg rity of the C&As and engine system s or would cause a h azardous en gine effect. \\n \\n  (4) Externals may also include com pone nts in  the engine flow-path that provide data to \\ncomponents on the engine case. For exam ple, te mperature, pressure, and speed probes or pick-\\nups.  \\n \\n g. Hazardous engine effect.  Any of the condi tions listed in § 33. 75, Safety analysis.  \\n \\n h. Internal com ponents. Vibration sensitive co mponents internal to the engine casing (see \\nchapter 5).  \\n \\n i. Operating range of rota tional speeds. The physical and, when applicable, corrected \\nspeeds up to and including the rated and m aximum perm issible operating lim itations established \\nunder § 33.7. \\n \\n j. Vibration. Includes the vi bratory characteristics or dynam ic phenom ena exhibited by \\nthe engine, its com ponents, system s, or assem blies. \\n \\n2 \\n7/25/07      AC 33.63-1 \\nCHAPTE R 2.  GENERAL VIB RATION REQ UIREME NTS. \\n \\n2.1. The Engine . \\n \\n a. For the purpose of this guidance, we di stingu ish between the extern al and  internal \\nengine com ponents, discussed in chapters 4 and 5, respectively. W hen as sessing engine \\nvibration, you should consider the following:  \\n       \\n  (1) The elem ents of design, such as to lerances and resulting g eometrical variability, \\nthat hav e a measurable ef fect on the  natura l frequencies, amplitud e resp onse, or oth er vibr ation \\ncharacteristics of the eng ine. For example, the bl ade geom etrical tolerances m ay result in a range \\nof frequencies for each n ormal mode which s hould be considered when assessing the b lades \\nresonant stresses.  \\n \\n  (2) The m anufacturing or production spec ifications and the recommendations in the \\nengine m anuals th at affect eng ine vibration. For exam ple, to account for the variability in roto r \\nunbalance due to m anufacturing, assem bly, or mainte nance, you m ay test, or perform  analysis, at \\nor above th e highest levels of  unbalance perm itted to occur.  \\n \\n  (3) The engine configurations resulting from  certain fault condi tions created by likely \\nmechanical failures, such as part ial airfoil loss (s ee paragraph 3.4).  \\n \\n2.2. The Flight E nvelope and Operating C onditions.  \\n \\n a. You should consider the following aspects of the declared flight envelope and the \\noperating range of rotational speeds and pow er or thrust required under § 33.63:  \\n \\n  (1) Power or thrust up to and includi ng the m aximum rating values, and rotational \\nspeeds up to and including the rated and m aximum perm issible physical and corrected speeds. \\nMaxim um perm issible speeds include any declared  transients. Som e components, such as the \\nexternals, are vibration sensitive to only physic al rotational speeds; other com ponents, such as \\nthe internals, m ay be vibration sensitive to the flowpath conditi ons associated with the rated \\nthrust/power and represented by the corrected sp eeds. The co rrected rotational speed of a rotor \\nsystem  is determ ined by norm alizing the rotor m odule in let co nditions to a standard condition of \\nair at 59 °Fahrenheit (518.67 °Rankine). The corr ection values are determ ined e mpirically and \\nare app lied by the formula: \\n \\n518.67TNN\\ninletr\\nc=\\n  \\nWhere: \\n \\n- N c and N r are the corrected and physi cal rotational speeds, and \\n \\n \\n3 \\nAC 33.63-1   7/25/07 \\n- Tinlet is the rotor m odule inlet te mperature in degrees Rankine. \\n \\n  (2) Engine operations and maneuvers that affect vibra tion, such as engine starts, \\nshutdowns, acceleration s, decelerations, idles, c hops, and bursts. For example, during  engine \\nvibration sig nature testin g, snap  accelerations m ay highligh t impulse driv en transien t responses, \\nwhile slow accelerations and d ecelerations allow s ufficient tim e for steady state vibrato ry peaks \\nto develop.  \\n \\n  (3) Flight envelope param eters, such as altitudes, ambient tem peratures, or any other \\nparam eter that m ay affect engine vibration. For exam ple, a mbient tem peratures affect corrected \\nspeeds whic h, in turn, m ay affect amplitud e resp onse. \\n \\n  (4) Operating conditions, such as icing and ice accretion, that aff ect vibration and that \\nmay produc e rotor unb alances in excess of that resulting from  the ro tor(s) design, m anufacturing, \\nand m aintenance shown to com ply with § 33.63 (see paragraph 3.2.b).  \\n \\n2.3. The Engine Vibratory S tresses. \\n \\n a. As required by § 33.63, you m ust demonstrate that the engine and its components, when \\noperating throughout the declared operating envelope, including any declared m aximum \\nrotational speeds, are free from  excessive vi bration (see paragraph 1.2.e  for a definition of \\n“excessive vibration”).  \\n \\n b. Your dem onstration should address the vi bratory loads representative of norm al or \\ntypical engine operations, as well as those asso ciated with ad verse conditions expected to occur \\nwithin the declared flight e nvelope. You should dem onstrate th at vibratory st resses are not \\nexcessive under any of these representative conditions.  \\n \\n c. Engine designs or operating restrictions  that allo w and m anage accum ulation of high \\ncycle fatigu e dam age for any com ponent are not  acceptable if the failu re of that com ponent \\nwould cause a hazardou s engine effect. Vibration  stresses abo ve endurance lim its resu lt in h igh \\ncycle fatigue dam age. Continued or  repeated operation at  these stress lev els results in  cum ulative \\nfatigue damage and, ultim ately, component fatig ue failure. H owever, the com ponents tested \\nunder § 33.83 m ust demonstrate vibr atory stresses lower than th e endurance lim its by a suitable \\nmargin as noted in § 33.83(d).  \\n \\n2.4. The Vibratory Forces Imparted to the Aircraft.  T o com ply wi th the requirem ent of § 33.63 \\nthat no excessive vibration forces be im parted to the aircraft structure, you should disclose in the \\nengine installation or operation manuals the vibration forces imp arted to the aircraft. At a \\nminimum, disclose the vibration caused by roto r unbalance f or which engine com pliance with \\npart 33 requirem ents has been shown. This is nece ssary becaus e there are n o engine lev el criteria \\nfor what constitu te ex cessive forces f or the airc raft. During engine cer tification, we recomm end \\nthat you coordinate with the airc raft m anufacturer to identify th e engine vibration forces that \\nwould be excessive for an  aircraft installation.  \\n \\n4 \\n7/25/07      AC 33.63-1 \\n2.5. Acceptable Methods of Com pliance.  \\n \\n a. You m ust show com pliance to § 33.63 base d on engine and/or com pone nt test, analysis, \\nor a com bination of test and analysis. Consid er testing as the m eans of compliance for all \\ncomponents that: \\n  \\n  (1) Are c ritical;  \\n \\n  (2) Have sig nificant reso nances th at fall within or  close to the rota tiona l speeds dec lared \\nas operating lim itations under § 33.7; or  \\n \\n  (3) Are exposed to com plex vibration that cannot be adequately determ ined by analysis. \\n \\n b. The com pliance m ethods m ay be specific to certain com pone nts, or category of \\ncomponents, i.e., external or internal and rotating or non-rotating compone nts. Specific \\ncompliance issues are discussed further in chapte r 4 for external com ponents and in chapter 5 for \\ninternal com ponents. You should use the sam e or sim ilar m ethods to show com pliance for all \\nother com ponents not discussed in chapters 4 and 5. These include engi ne cases, fram es, and \\ncombustors; and airfram e interface com ponents, such as engine m ounts, exhaust nozzles, and \\nthrust reve rsers. \\n \\n c. Data produced for com pliance with othe r airworthiness requirem ents m ay be used, \\nwhen applicable, to satisfy the requirem ents of § 33.63, as illustrated in T able 1. \\n \\n d. You m ay use prior experience to show  com pliance for certain com ponents with \\nsufficient service h istory and predictable vib ratory characteris tics. For example, certain hardware \\nmay have be en proven in operation on other engine m odels and for the broad range of  \\nfrequencies that cover th e certification engine.  \\n \\n e. Analytical m ethods are acceptable if th ey are validated by o ther testing, including \\ntesting done to evaluate vibrati on in com pliance with other part 33 requirem ents. The analytical \\nmethods should include prediction of the vibrat ory environm ent to which the com ponents are \\nsubjected and the assessm ent of these com ponents vibratory responses. T he goal is to show that \\nthe vib ration  stres ses are not excess ive. \\n \\n5 \\nAC 33.63-1 7/25/07 \\nTable 1.

ROTOR UNBAL ANCE \\n \\n3.1. General.   \\n a. Rotor m ass imbalance, comm only known as unba lance, is due to the eccentricity of the \\nrotor m ass center relative to its ax is of rotation. This unbalance is  generally the result of rotor \\nmanufacture and assem bly, and, although unavoida ble, can be reduced through com pensating \\ntechniqu es. Lim itation o f rotor unbalance is n eeded because rotating m ass unbalance results in \\nsynchronous vibration at rotor sp eed frequencie s. The acceptable lim its for roto r unbalance are \\nusually identified in the production speci fications and/or engine m anuals.  \\n \\n b. In this chapter, we discuss how to achi eve the engine level of  unbalance and how to \\ndeterm ine the effects of this unbalance by engine test. At a m inimum, we recomm end a n engine \\ntest for certification of new engi nes. Analysis, or a com bination of  analysis and test, m ay be used \\nif it shows that the rotor unbalan ce and its effects can be adequate ly characterized. The analytical \\nmethods are acceptable if validated an d supported by the data acquired du ring an engine test. The \\ngoal is to establish the vibrat ion environm ent at the locations  of com pone nts to be certified, \\nthroughout the frequency range of the engine’s rotors rotational speeds , and for the unbalance \\nlevels iden tified in this c hapter. \\n \\n3.2. Level of Unbalance.  \\n \\n a. The engine’s low speed, high speed, and any interm ediate speed m ain rotors m ust be \\nunbalanced with the goal of accom plishing th e highest perm issible v ibration levels for all rotors \\nwhen m easured at the en gine vib ration monito ring sensors. F or exam ple, to achieve this \\nunbalance f or an engine having two-speed rotor sy stem s, we recomm end t hat you build the test \\nengine with the highest perm issible unbalance fo r the high speed rotor system , then trim balance \\nthe low spee d fan and tur bine ro tors to the le vels perm itted f or the low speed roto r. This \\ncombination of high and low speed ro tor unbalanc es will constitute the unb alance condition for \\nsubsequent unbalance testing. \\n \\n b. In addition to the ro tor unbalance p ermitted by design and m aintenance p ractice, you \\nshould also address unbalances th at develop in operating envir onments, such as icing and ice \\naccretion, if more severe.  You m ay determ ine the level of unb alance caused by ice accretion \\nbased on that observed du ring § 33.68 icing test.  \\n \\n3.3. Effect of Rotor Unbalance - Engine Vibration Signature.  \\n \\n a. The vibratio n signatu res for the engin e, its accessory gearbox,  or any other assem bly \\nsystem  if necessary, should be determ ined with representative unbalanced rotors, as noted above. \\nYou should identify the vibration signatures representative of  an engine operating throughout its \\ndeclared envelope and ranges of rotational speeds. These sign atures, p articul arly their significant \\nvibratory peaks, can then be used  in assessing en gine vibration.  \\n \\n  b. The rotor unbalance effects and engine vibration signature sh ould be determ ined by \\nengine test and m easured by m eans of vibration sensors placed at spec ific locations on the \\n7 \\nAC 33.63-1   7/25/07 \\nengine. Place these v ibration senso rs, accelerom eters, or cond ition m onitoring units at the \\nlocations on the engin e that are sensitive to roto r system  unbala nces, and, when necessary, near \\nor on specific com ponents.  \\n \\n c. You should obtain each vibration sig nature during slow accelerations and deceleration s \\nthat cov er the speed rang es from  minimum  to maximum rated or perm issible rotational speeds, \\ninclud ing an y declared transien ts. Th e tim e dur ation for each slow acceleration and d eceleration \\nshould be at least 2 m inutes. In  addition, consider m aneuvers such  as throttle bu rsts and chops. \\nVibratory su rveys of m ultiple engines  and repe ated acceleratio ns and/or decelerations m ay be \\nneeded to capture a representative en gine vib ration signature. The engine configuration m ust be \\nrepresentative of its installe d mass and stiffness and account fo r the airfram e interfaces and \\naccesso ries that m ight a ffect engine vibration. \\n \\n d. You should ensure that each rotor syst em unbalance used to dem onstrate com pliance \\nwith § 33.63, including that used to determ ine the engine vibration signatures, is representative \\nof the instru ctions f or rotor ba lancin g prescr ibed in the eng ine manuals. This is to en sure tha t the \\nrotor unbalance introduced during engine m aintenan ce will m aintain engine  vibration within the \\nbounds shown to m eet the safety standards of § 33.63.  \\n \\n3.4. Unbalance Caused by Fault Conditions.  Certai n fault conditions, such as the out-of-balance \\ncaused by partial airfoil loss, m ust not result in vibration leading to hazardous engine effects. \\nYou should address these fault condi tions if the resulting engine vibration m ay not be recognized \\nas abnorm al, so adequate action can be taken, a nd if continued operation in  this condition could \\ncause a hazardous engine effect. For exam ple, afte r the loss of a blade tip, the level of vibration \\nmay not be recognized as abnorm al if it is below the lim its in the engine m anuals; but continued \\nengine ope ration in this configuratio n could trig ger multiple failu res cau sing a hazardo us engine \\neffect before adequate action can be taken. Consider the extent of  blade loss associated with the \\nlevel of vibration that m ay not be recognizab le, yet m ay be sufficient to produce a hazardous \\nengine effect if no imm ediate action is taken. The fault c onditions effects addressed in \\ncompliance with § 33.83(e) m ay qualify for com pliance with these requirem ents. W hen an out-\\nof-balance rotor continues to rotate after the engine is shut down, this falls under the requirem ents \\nof § 33.74, Continued rotation.  \\n8 \\n7/25/07      AC 33.63-1 \\nCHAPTE R 4.  EXT ERNAL COMPONENT S VIBRATION \\n \\n4.1. General. \\n \\n a. Since externals are primarily m ounted on the engine casing, they are exposed to \\nvibration defined by engine rotational speeds an d rotor unbalances. Excessive vibration could \\nlead to structural or functiona l failure of the exte rnals.  \\n \\n b. The extern als’ vibratory characteristics may be determ ined by test, analysis, or a \\ncombination of both. The decision to test or c onduct analysis should be  based on the criteria \\nidentified in paragraph 2.5.a. If testing is needed, the procedures outlined in this chapter m ay be \\nused to dem onstrate co mpliance with § 33.63. If an alysis is acceptable, see parag raph 2.5.e for a \\ndiscussion of analytical m ethods. \\n \\n c. Consider the vibratory environm ent produ ced by rotor unbalance discussed in chapter 3. \\nAvoid asses sing the effects of vi bration differently because th ey occur in a trans ient or a steady \\nstate reg ime when these regim es may be specifi c to an aircraft inst allation and operation. For \\nexam ple, consider that steady reg imes may vary  with engine multiple thr ust ratings, e ngine \\ndeterioration, operators’ dera te practices, flight profiles,  and other considerations.  \\n \\n d. You should assess the vibrator y stresses at the level of sy stem assem bly and consider \\nthe interactions between system  components. For exam ple, assess th e vibratory characteristics of \\nharnesses at the electrical system  level or as assembled on the engine. You should also assess the \\neffects of a system ’s operation on its vibratory ch aracteristics.  For exam ple, consider the fuel \\nsystem  pressure effects on the natural frequencie s of the f lexible fuel lines and their resonant \\nresponses.  \\n \\n4.2. Vibration Test. \\n \\n a. Vibration testing m ay be conducted on an e ngine and/or by laborator y test (shake table). \\nThe decision to perform a full engine test, a la boratory test, or both, s hould at least consider \\nwhether the external component vibratory environm ent is already known and whether the \\nlaboratory test equipm ent can accommodate th at com ponent and accurately represen t its \\nvibratory environm ent. For exam ple, for a new e ngine m odel, consider ru nning a full engine test \\nbecause the vibratory en vironm ent is  not fully kn own for all externals. Vibration tes ts perform ed \\nin com pliance with other part 33 regulations m ay be elig ible for a show ing of com pliance with \\n§ 33.63. See Table 1 for com pliance shown to other part 33 regulations that m ay also apply to \\n§ 33.63. \\n \\n b. You should run a stair-step endurance test  with representative  rotor unbalances (see \\nchapter 3) and cover the entire range of com pone nt frequencies.  However, for those com ponents \\nfor which the ranges of natura l frequencies and the vibratio n environm ent are well known, you \\nmay perfor m only dwell endurance te sts. For a new engine model, consider running the stair-step \\ntest for the high speed rotor frequencies and the dw ell te st for the low spee d rotor f requencies.  \\n \\n \\n9 \\nAC 33.63-1   7/25/07 \\n c. The tested com ponents must be able to function as intended and m ust be free of any \\ndamage and wear beyond the acceptable lim its when  subjected to a repres entative v ibration tes t. \\n \\n4.3. Stair-Step E ndurance Test. \\n \\n a. The objective of a stair-ste p endurance test run f or an engine is to excite the engine \\nresonances, i.e., the resonances of all com ponents and system s, and to m aintain the level of \\nresulting vibration for a num ber of cycles sufficient to dem onstrate endurance. To accom plish \\nthis, the test should be run with the unbalance levels discu ssed in paragraph 3.2 and should cover \\nthe operating range of rotational speeds. The te st should be conducted during acceleration and \\nthen deceleration, in step increm ents and with  dwell tim es on each step. You should choose a \\nsmall enough step size and an adequate step dwell ti me to ensure that sufficient num ber of cycles \\nare accum ulated at each frequency in  the rang e. We recommend increm ental steps of 120 rpm  of \\nthe high roto r speed and a dwell tim e on each st ep equivalent to one m illion (1E6) on e-per-\\nrevolution cycles of the high speed rotor.  \\n \\n b. When stair-step testing is conducted, you s hould obtain both pre- and post-test engine \\nvibration s ignatures. S ignificant d ifferences in th e engine vibration signatu res m ust be explained. \\n \\n4.4. Dwell Endurance Test.  This test is usually c onducted to assess the engine com ponents and \\nthe frequencies not covered in the stair-step test or to assess an y com ponent for which a vibratory \\nassessm ent is necessary. These com ponents should be subjected to the significant vibration \\nidentified during the engine signatu re test, the s tair-step tes ts, or any other applicable testing or \\nanalysis. The significant vibrati on is usually associated with th e highest amplitude peaks, but \\ncertain lowe r peaks m ay requir e further asse ssment if  they f all within o r close to the r otational \\nspeeds declared as operating lim itations under § 3 3.7. W henever specific fre quencies are targeted \\nand dwell endurance tests are condu cted, the dwell tim e should be equivalent to a m inimum  of \\nten m illion ( 1E7) cycle s to dem onstrate endu rance streng th. W hen test d urations would be \\nunreasonab ly long becau se of the lo w frequency vibration, y ou m ay shorten the test if an \\nappropriate com pensation is applied. For exam ple, you m ay shorten the test by increasing the \\nvibratory stress based on the material fatigue properties. \\n10 \\n7/25/07      AC 33.63-1 \\nCHAPTE R 5.  INTERNAL CO MPONENT S VIBRATION \\n \\n5.1. General.  In addition to v ibration resu lting from  excitations of  natural freq uencies \\n(resonances), if applicable, consider the effect  of rotor unbalance on internal com ponents (see \\nchapter 3).  \\n \\n5.2. The Blades, Vanes, Rotor Disks, Spacers, and Rotor Shafts. \\n \\n a. Blades, vanes, rotor d isks, spacers, a nd rotor sh afts shown to com ply with § 33.83, \\nVibration test, also satisfy the § 33.63 requirem ent that engine co mponents m ust not be subjected \\nto excessive stresses because of vibration. The blades, vanes, rotor d isks, spacers, and  rotor \\nshafts not tested in com pliance with § 33.83 should be addre ssed under §  33.63. In ad dition, the \\ndesign aspects or operating conditi ons that affect vibration an d that were not assum ed for \\ncompliance with § 33.83 should be addressed under § 33.63. For exam ple, you should consider \\nthe rang es of geom etric toleran ces, tip clearances , and other f actors affecting natural f requencies \\nand am plitude response, if these were not exam ined in com pliance with § 33.83. To dem onstrate \\nthat the stresses are not excessive, we r ecomm end that you use th e criteria of § 33.83(d). \\nOtherwise, you should jus tify different criteria. \\n \\n b. You should address the effects on vibration th at are anticipated or determined to occur \\nin operating conditions like icing, rain, and hail, and for which re peated or continuous engine \\noperation is expected. T hese conditions m ight af fect, for example, blade vibratory amplitude \\nresponses or flutter m argins. Repeated exposure to high cycle fatigue stresses in excess of \\nendurance lim its for even short periods of tim e could lead to cum ulative fatigue dam age and \\nsubsequent com ponent failure. If these vibratory stresses exceed the levels dem onstrated during \\n§ 33.83 compliance, § 33.63 requires that  you show they are not excessive. \\n \\n5.3. The Fan Case.  You should show by analysis, test, or experience that the f an case and fan \\nrotors are no t sensitiv e to rotor -case intera ctions, and no conditions exist that m ay cause this \\nphenom enon to develop. Fan rotor-case inte raction is a dynam ic phenomenon that m ust be \\navoided since it is potentially hazardous. This interaction coul d rapidly produce destructive and \\nunavoidable vibration, rendering th e vibration monitors ineffec tive for any tim ely action or \\nresponse.   \\n \\n5.4. Other Com ponents.  You should assess any ot her internal com ponents sens itive to eng ine \\nvibration not referenced in paragraphs 5.2 and 5.3 and show that they are not subjected to \\nexcessive stresses. The com pliance m ethods m ay be based on test or analysis and m ay use data \\nor observation collected during cert ification te sting in com pliance with other part 33 regulations \\n(see Tab le 1). \\n \\n11 \\nAC 33.63-1   7/25/07 \\nCHAPTE R 6.  CONDUCT OF T ESTING \\n \\n6.1. Configuration. \\n \\n a. The engine and its com ponents, includ ing m ountings, attachments, and vibration \\nisolators, that are tested for com pliance with § 33.63 m ust be representati ve of their type design. \\nFor testing purposes for every com ponent and engine system , you should create the vibratory \\nenvironm ent that adequately represents the engi ne. You should also confi gure any test to account \\nfor the engin e installatio n features o r interfaces that m ight affect engine  vibration. E xamples of \\ninstallation f eatures are the cowli ng; the engine mounts; and airfram e elem ents, such as inlet and \\nexhaust structures, for w hich the weight, center of gravity, or stiffne ss would affect engine \\nvibration. When the installati on features are not entirely know n, you should provide in the \\ninstallation instructions requi red by § 33.5 the m ethods to eval uate their effects on engine \\nvibration.  \\n \\n b. Certain components, such as fluid-filled lines and hoses, s hould be configured to assess  \\nthe effects on vibration of pressures, tem peratures, or any other f unctional param eters.   \\n \\n6.2. Instrum entation. \\n \\n a. You m ust ensure that sufficient instru mentation is present to monitor engine vibration \\nthroughout the test. The instrum entation m ust be capable of, and located, so that it properly \\nidentifies th e critical v ibratory environm ent for those com ponents subjected to test. F or exam ple, \\nthe vib ration  monitor units m ust be placed based o n their sens itivity respon se to ro tor unbalance. \\nThe com parison of vibratory signatures of the nom inal versus  unbalanced rotors m ay constitu te \\nan indicator for the sensitivit y response of the vibration m onitor units. You should consider \\nplacing accelerom eters o r vibration s ensors on or near th e fan case, com pressor case, com bustor \\ncase, exhau st fram e, and accesso ry gearbox to determ ine their vibratory en vironm ent.   \\n \\n b. Additional instrum entation m ay be require d to id entify the v ibratory environm ent for \\nspecific com ponents and accesso ries.  \\n \\n6.3. Test Sequence and Success Criteria. \\n \\n a. Prior to testing, you m ust identify the pass/ fail criteria, such as  engine or com ponent \\nperform ance, vibration levels, and acceptable post- test inspection criteria.  The pass/fail criteria \\nmust includ e the cap ability to d etect the engin e vibration with an accep table lev el of accuracy.  \\n \\n b. You should plan the test sequence to en sure that significant vibration is found and \\naddressed in  subsequent testing. For exam ple, th e vibration signature test  must preced e the stair-\\nstep and dw ell tests to e nsure tha t all peak and s ignificant v ibration em erging during the \\nvibration signature test ar e considered during the st air-step an d dwell te sts. \\n \\n6.4. Post Test Inspection. You should perfor m all necessary post-test evaluations and \\ninspections with the goal of det ecting any com ponent structural or functional failures. Because \\nhigh cycle fatigue dam age m ay not be detected  by a sim ple visual inspection, rem ove the \\n12 \\n7/25/07      AC 33.63-1 \\nvibration sensitiv e components and thoroughly inspect  them . Your test p lan should id entify the \\ninspection m ethods, including visual, non-destructiv e inspections, or functi onal tests. You should \\nexplain any dam age, distress, or  wear beyond the lim its set for pos t-test inspection and provide \\nan analys is of the im pact tha t it presents.  \\n \\n13 \\n \\n      \\nSubje ct: GUIDANCE MATERIAL FOR 14 CFR \\n§33.19, DURABILITY, FOR RECIPROCATING \\nENGINE REDESIGNED PARTS.

This advisory circular (AC)  provides guidance and acceptable m ethods, but \\nnot the only m ethods, that m ay be used to dem onstrate that redesigned parts for reciprocating \\nengines com ply with the requirem ents of § 33.19 of  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations \\n(14 CFR).  This AC addresses m ajor type desi gn changes, parts m anufacturing approvals (PMA), \\nand supplem ental type certificates (STC) for drive system  or structural parts in reciprocating \\nengines.  Like all AC m aterial, this AC is not, in itself , mandatory and does not constitute a \\nregulation.  W hile these guidelines are not m andatory, they are derived from  extensive Federal \\nAviation Adm inistration (FAA) and industry experience in determ ining com pliance with the \\npertinent regulations.  \\n \\n2. APPLICABILITY. \\n \\n a. The guidance provided in this docum ent is directed to engine m anufacturers, parts \\nmanufacturers, m odifiers, f oreign regulatory au thorities, and Federal Aviation Adm inistration \\n(FAA) engine type certification engineers and th eir designees.  This AC applies to PMA (test \\nand com putation), STC, or m ajor type de sign change certification projects involving \\nreciprocating system  or structural parts on r eciprocating engines.  These parts are used on \\nreciprocating engines certificated under part 33 a nd installed in aircraft certificated under parts \\n23, 27, and 29.  This AC does not apply to m inor type design changes or PMA parts approved by \\nthe FAA as being identical to the corresponding e ngine type design part, as those parts are not \\nconsidered redesigned. \\n \\n b. This m aterial is neither m andatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation.  It describes acceptable m eans, but not the only m eans, for dem onstrating com pliance \\nwith the applicable regulations.  The FAA will consider other m ethods of dem onstrating \\ncompliance that an applicant m ay elect to present.  Term s such as “should,” “shall,” “m ay,” and \\n“must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular m ethod of \\ncompliance when the acceptable m ethod of com pliance in this docum ent is used.  W hile these \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\nguidelines are not m andatory, they are derived from  extensive FAA and industry experience in \\ndeterm ining com pliance with the relevant regulations.  If the FAA later decides that following \\nthis AC would result in noncom pliance with applicable regulations, the FAA is not bound by the \\nterms of this AC and m ay require additional substantiation as the basis for finding com pliance.   \\n \\n c. This AC does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or perm it \\ndeviations from  existing regulatory requirem ents. \\n \\n3.

INTRODUCTION \\n2 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\n \\n1-1. Background .   \\n \\n a. Today’s horizontally-opposed piston engines were first certified in the late 1940s and \\n1950s.  These engines entered service with recom mended Tim e Between Overhaul (TBO) \\nintervals of 500 to 750 hours.  These TBOs were recom mended by the engine designer and \\napproved by the FAA based on the results of the certification block testing.  Successful \\nperform ance of the block testing was sufficient to substantiate safe operation over the \\nrecom mended TBO because of the short duration of those initial TBOs, thus m eeting the \\ndurability requirem ent of CAR § 13.104.  However, over the last 50 years, advances in m aterials, \\nmanufacturing processes, and engineering analys is methods have enabled engine m anufacturers \\nto design m ore durable engines.  This has allowed the m anufacturers to gradually increase their \\nrecom mended TBOs for existing engine designs to intervals up to 2000 hours.  The FAA \\napproved these TBO increases based on successf ul service, engineering design, and test \\nexperience.  New engine designs, however, are still introduced with relatively short TBOs, in the \\nrange of 600 hours to 1000 hours, with TBO extensions approved by the FAA after accum ulation \\nof successful service experience. \\n \\n b. Reciprocating system  and structural parts have historically been designed to operate \\nwith safety factors large enough to ensure that operating stress levels are significantly below \\ntheir relevant fatigue strengths or endurance lim its.  Under norm al operating conditions, these \\nparts can be expected to have essentially infinite fatigue lives so the engine designer does not \\nnorm ally assign them  a service life.  This is in contrast to rotor structures in turbine engines, \\nwhich typically have specified service lives beyond which structural failure is expected.   \\n \\n   (1)  For turbine engines, finite lives and the hazard to aircraft if a turbine rotor failure \\noccurs require lif e lim its for turbine parts.  Lif e limits are designated as airworthiness lim itations \\nfor the turbine engine m odel and the FAA considers them  mandatory.   \\n \\n   (2)  For reciprocating engines, the essentially infinite fatigue lives of drive system  and \\nstructural parts, along with the reduced hazard to the aircraft in the event of their failure, m ake \\nlife lim its and m andatory airworthiness lim itations unnecessary.  Instead, the reciprocating \\nengine designer establishes recom mended periodic engine inspection intervals, called TBOs, \\nwhich provide for inspection of these drive system  and structural parts.  These parts are then \\nrepaired or replaced as necessary.  Their extrem ely durable nature does not however, dim inish \\nthe im portance of evaluating the fatigue life of th ese parts.  If the engine designer cannot show \\nthat the operating stress levels are significantly below the fatigue endurance lim it of the m aterial \\nfor a drive system  or structural part in a reci procating engine, then the designer should assign a \\nunique service interval to the part to require replacem ent before the fatigue life expires.  \\n \\n c. The linkage between fatigue lives of parts and engine TBO was originally addressed by \\ncivil aviation authorities in CAR § 13.2020, Durability.  This requirem ent was published in \\nAugust 1941,  and applied solely to reciprocating engines, as turbine engines had not yet been \\nintroduced in civil aviation.  The initial version of the durability requirem ent stated that: “The \\nwearing surfaces, lubrication system  and parts subject to fatigue  shall be so designed and \\nconstructed that no unsaf e condition will develop between overhaul periods  when the engine is \\n3 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\nproperly installed, operated and m aintained in an aircraft” (em phasis added).  The wording of \\nthis original version of the durability requirem ent established the unam biguous link between \\nfatigue life and overhaul periods.  The durability requirem ent later becam e CAR § 13.104 and \\nread: “all parts of the engine shall be designed and constructed to m inimize the developm ent of \\nan unsafe condition of the engine between overhaul periods.”  Section 33.19 still reads \\nsubstantially the sam e as § 13.104 regarding the durability of reciprocating engines, requiring the \\nengine design to m inimize the developm ent of an unsafe condition between overhaul periods.  \\n \\n d. Over the life of an engine, redesigned parts are approved for incorporation into existing \\nengine designs through type design changes, PMA,  or STC and can involve m aterial, m aterial \\nprocess, or geom etry changes, or any com bination of  these three.  W hat may initially appear to \\nbe a relatively benign design change, such as a m aterial process change, can actually have a \\nsignif icant ef fect on m aterial strength or stress and on the ability of  the part to operate saf ely for \\nthe recom mended engine TBO. \\n \\n e. Replacem ent PMA parts approved under the identicality guidelines of § 21.303(c)(4) \\nand FAA Order 811.42A, paragraphs 9a(3)(a) and (b) are not considered redesigned parts.  The \\ncertification data subm itted to the FAA for these replacem ent PMA parts should substantiate that \\nthe part does not incorporate any design changes relative to the corresponding engine type \\ndesign part.  If the engine designer cannot show this, then the part should be evaluated in \\naccordance with the test and com putation guidelines applicable to PMA parts.  \\n \\n f.  The regulations governing these design changes require that engine parts be \\ndesigned to operate safely for the duration of the applicable overhaul interval.  The \\napplicable overhaul interval is either the recom mended TBO for the engine on which the \\npart will be installed or a TBO established specif ically f or the redesigned part.  W hen \\napplicants recognized the effect of lengthy TBOs on durability, they have perform ed tests \\nand analyses specif ically to m eet the durability requirem ent.  These tests and analyses \\ntypically substantiate extrem ely lengthy or essentially infinite fatigue lives.  In other \\ncases the durability requirem ent was substantiated solely by perf ormance of  the \\nendurance test required in § 33.49, despite lengthy TBOs.  The FAA has developed this \\nAC to describe acceptable m ethods, but not the only m ethods, for showing com pliance \\nwith the durability regulations. \\n \\n1-2. Definitions . \\n \\n a. Essentially Inf inite Fatigue or Service Lif e.  Essentially inf inite service or f atigue lives \\nmeans the calculated fatigue life of the part is such a high num ber that it will not be reached \\nduring the typical operating life of the engine.   \\n \\n b. Fatigue Mechanism .  Fatigue m echanism  is how a crack starts and propagates from  \\nrepeated loading. \\n \\n c. Margin of Safety .  The m argin of safety is the ratio of excess strength to the nom inal \\nrequired strength in the design of a part. \\n \\n4 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\n d. Drive system  Parts.   Drive system  parts are the parts that transm it the power produced \\nin the com bustion cham ber to the propeller flange. \\n \\n e. Redesigned Parts .  Redesigned parts are parts for which m aterial changes, m aterial \\nprocess changes, geom etry changes, or any com bination of changes have been incorporated into \\nan existing approved design.  FAA approval of these parts is accom plished through m ajor type \\ndesign changes, PMA, or STC.  Replacem ent PMA parts approved under the identicality \\nguidelines or parts with m inor design changes are not considered redesigned parts.  \\n \\n f.  Structural Parts.   Structural parts are parts that hold drive system  parts within the engine \\nor otherwise hold the engine assem bly together.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nCHAPTER 2.  GENERAL \\n \\n2-1. Certification Procedures .  The certification procedures in part 21 require redesigned parts to \\nmeet the applicable airworthiness standards of  the f ollowing Sections: \\n5 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\n \\n a. Section 21.303(c)(4), airworthiness requirem ents for PMA parts substantiated by test \\nand com putation, \\n \\n b. Section 21.115(a), airworthiness requirem ents for STC parts, and   \\n \\n c. Section 21.101(a), airworthiness requirem ents for type design changes.  \\n \\n2-2. Airworthiness Standards .  For engine parts, Part 33 contains the applicable regulations or \\nairworthiness standards.  The applicant for m ajor design change, PMA, or STC should review \\nthese regulations and determ ine which specific sections require re-evaluation based on the \\nredesign of the part and the extent of that rede sign.  Drive system  or structural parts, by their \\nvery nature, require re-evaluation of  durability when redesigned. \\n \\n2-3. Durability Com pliance .  For PMA (test and com putation), STC, or m ajor type design \\nchange certification projects involving drive system  or structural parts in reciprocating engines, \\nthe following should be considered when substantiating com pliance with § 33.19: \\n \\n a. The extent of the redesign.  \\n \\n b. The TBO that applies to the engine on which the part will be installed, unless the \\napplicant chooses to specify a separate inspection or replacem ent interval for the part.  The \\napplicant should perform  testing and analysis sufficient to substantiate a fatigue life that is \\nessentially inf inite unless a f atigue lif e lim it is def ined f or the part. \\n \\n c. The substantiation m ay include m aterial analyses and testing, finished part analysis and \\ntesting, and engine block testing. \\n \\n d. For parts for which a fatigue life lim it has not been defined, the substantiation test \\nmethods should be designed to accum ulate a sufficient num ber of significant stress cycles for \\nsubstantiation of an extrem ely lengthy (essentially infinite) fatigue life.  The test m ethods should \\nalso consider the duty cycle per flight of the applicable engine, extrapolated to the recom mended \\nTBO.  Engine param eters, such as m anifold pressure, horsepower, cylinder head tem perature \\n(CHT), exhaust gas tem perature (EGT), and revolutions per m inute (RPM), should be selected to \\nsimulate the m ost adverse fatigue loading conditions expected in service. \\n \\n2-4. Conform ity.  The certification procedures specified in part 21 require that parts undergoing \\ncertification testing be shown to conform  to th eir type design.  This conform ity requirem ent \\nencom passes all aspects of the type design, including m anufacturing and assem bly processes, \\nmaterial specifications, and finished part conform ity.  The specific regulations are: \\n \\n a. Section 21.303(e), (e)(1), and §§ 21.303(f)(2) through (f)(4) specify conform ity \\nrequirem ents for PMA parts.  They require the applicant to dem onstrate that the m aterials, part \\ndesign, and processes, construction, and assem bly conform  to the design and authorize the \\nAdm inistrator to m ake any inspection necessary to determ ine com pliance with these \\nrequirem ents. \\n6 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\n \\n b. Sections 21.33 and 21.53 specify conform ity requirem ents for STC and type design \\nchange projects.    \\n \\n2-5. Model Eligibility .  Engine designers occasionally use parts with com mon part num bers on \\nseveral different engine m odels.  For PMA appli cations for this type of com mon part, paragraph \\n9.g. (4) of FAA Order 8110.42A requires the Aircraft  Certification Office (ACO) reviewing the \\napplication to separately evaluate the installation eligibility of  the part f or each engine m odel.  \\nFAA approval will be based upon a determ ination that each engine m odel will continue to \\ncomply with the applicable airworthiness regula tions with the PMA replacem ent part installed.  \\nAs discussed throughout this AC, the applicable airworthiness regulations include a requirem ent \\nthat the applicant dem onstrate the durability of  the part, which would require that the com mon \\npart operate safely between overhaul intervals for each of the engine m odels on which it is \\nproposed to be installed.  Testing should be perform ed on each engine m odel, unless it can be \\nshown that the installed environm ent (stress, tem perature, etc.) of the engine m odel for which the \\napplicant applies f or eligibility is less severe than a m odel f or which the part has previously been \\ntested and approved.  This can be done with an analysis that provides a quantitative com parison \\nof the installed environm ents in term s of the relevant engine operating param eters.       \\n \\n2-6. Com parative Analysis for PMA Parts.   FAA Order 8110.42A, paragraph 9.d.(2) provides \\nfor substantiation of PMA parts under test and com putation by com parative or general analysis.  \\nHowever, com parative analyses that rely on dim ensional and m etallographic com parisons, but \\nare not supported by testing, are not sufficient to substantiate the durability of the reciprocating \\nengine drive system  and structural parts.  The criticality and com plexity of  these parts is such \\nthat testing in accordance with this AC should be perform ed to substantiate the fatigue strength \\nand durability of the part.  This testing can be accom plished as an elem ent of either a general \\nanalysis or a com parative analysis substantiation program . \\n \\n2-7. Substantiation Guidance .  This AC provides the following inform ation for defining \\nsubstantiation plans to show com pliance with § 33.19 for drive system  or structural reciprocating \\nengine parts.  \\n \\n a. Recom mended substantiation m ethods, including conform ity, test, and analyses. \\n \\n b. An appendix that provides an overview of design issues to consider when changing a \\nprocess used to m anufacture a drive system  or structural reciprocating engine part, including \\nfactors that m ay affect stress and strength. \\n \\n c. An appendix that provides inform ation regarding the assessm ent of the strength of \\nmaterials used to m anufacture drive system  or structural parts. \\nCHAPTER 3.  COMPLIANCE METHODS \\n \\n3-1. General .  Durability com pliance m ethods for drive system  and structural parts m ay \\nencom pass both analysis and testing of the uninstalled part, along with engine testing of the \\ninstalled part.  FAA conform ity is required before com ponent and engine testing.   \\n \\n7 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\n3-2. Conform ity.   \\n \\n a. The validity of the certification tests depends on adherence to the type design during the \\nmanufacture of the test hardware.  The type design includes the m aterial properties, \\nmanufacturing processes, assem bly procedures, and physical part design characteristics.  FAA \\nconform ity requirem ents are intended to address these issues.  FAA conform ity is especially \\nimportant for drive system  and structural parts which operate at high stress levels (and high \\ntemperatures f or certain parts) and theref ore m ay be sensitive to variations in m aterial properties \\nand m anufacturing processes.  Control of these properties and processes is necessary to ensure \\nthat the fatigue m argin m eets the intent of the design.  \\n \\n b. A conform ity plan should be developed fo r the certification test hardware.  The plan \\nshould provide for conform ity of all phases of  manufacture of the specific part(s) to undergo \\ncertification testing.  The cognizant FAA ACO will establish FAA conform ity requirem ents. \\nThis requires advance planning and coordinating by both the applicant and the FAA for \\nconform ity of the initial stages of test hardware fabrication, such as the forging or casting \\nprocesses.  Chapter 5-2 of Order 8110.4B contains an overview of the process the FAA uses to \\nevaluate dem onstrations of conform ity.  In general, a conform ity plan should include the \\nfollowing elem ents: \\n \\n   (1)  Evaluation of the process m ethods and controls (such as forging, casting, \\nmachining, and surface finishing processes) that  were used during all phases of m anufacturing \\nthe certif ication test article; \\n \\n   (2)  Evaluation of in-process assem bly procedures used to assem ble the test article; \\n \\n   (3)  Observation of in-process functional tests perform ed during all phases of \\nmanufacture of  the test article; \\n \\n   (4)  Verification of the design characteristics of the finished part; \\n \\n   (5)  Verif ication of  the certif ication test installation; and  \\n \\n   (6)  Observation of  the certif ication tests.  \\n \\n3-3. Com ponent Analysis and Test .  Com ponent analyses and testing m ay be used to establish \\nbaseline m aterial strength and stress data for drive system  and structural parts.  This data can be \\nuseful for identifying any adverse im pact on m aterial strength or stress that the design change \\nmay have caused (see Appendix 1).  The data can also be used for future redesigns, service \\nproblem  resolution, and for the estim ation of design safety m argins.  The applicant m ay validate \\nthe accuracy of the data obtained from  the com ponent tests and analyses by testing the part while \\nit is installed in an engine.  \\n \\n a. Material Strength Evaluation.  Testing a nd m etallographic inspection of the finished \\npart, or partially finished part (forging, casting, etc.) is m ore representative of the actual part \\ncharacteristics than m aterial strength data obtained from  textbook m aterial reference data or \\n8 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\nindustry docum ents (see Appendix 2).  The following part characteristics should be addressed in \\nthe design of the part and test articles should be inspected as noted to evaluate m aterial strength \\n(see Appendix 2 for notes relative to these item s): \\n \\n   (1)  Dimensional and surface finish. \\n \\n   (2)  Crack and surface defects.  Inspect using m agnetic particle inspection (MPI), \\nultrasonic inspection (U/T) or fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI), or other m ethods \\nacceptable to the Adm inistrator. \\n \\n   (3)  Casting porosity.  Inspect using radiography and applicable reference standards. \\n \\n   (4)  Corrosion-resistant surface treatm ents, such as painting and plating. \\n \\n   (5)  Surface cold working operations, such as shot-peening.  \\n \\n   (6)  Material chem istry (typically obtained from  material supplier certificates). \\n \\n   (7)  Material hardness, including surface and internal hardness and also the case/core \\nhardness profile of nitrided, induction-hardened or carburized steel com ponents for case depth \\ndeterm ination. \\n \\n   (8)  Material m icrostructure and m acrostructure, including grain structure, grain \\nboundary anom alies, porosity, and inclusions. Metallographic inspections should be used to \\nevaluate these.  \\n \\n   (9)  Tensile, yield, and fatigue strength.  Use experim ental test m ethods such as rotating \\nbeam  tests of m aterial coupons or part specim ens. \\n \\n b. Stress Analysis. Knowledge of assem bly and operating stress levels is a valuable asset \\nregarding the structural aspects of com ponent developm ent, particularly during redesign or \\noptim ization of an existing design.  Stress analysis procedures m ay be used to resolve service \\ndifficulties involving com ponent cracking.  W ithout reliable stress data, structural design \\nevaluation m ay be extrem ely difficult.  Dependi ng on the part being evaluated, stress analysis \\nmay consist of theoretical or experim ental m ethods, or a com bination of these m ethods. \\n \\n   (1)  Theoretical.  Theoretical m ethods include basic calculations for com ponents with \\nrelatively sim ple configuration and finite elem ent m odeling for m ore com plex com ponents.  \\nFinite elem ent m odeling should be correlated to actual test data to ensure accuracy.  \\n \\n   (2)  Experim ental.  These stress analysis techniques com monly include laboratory \\nbench testing of com ponents.  They typically rely on the use of strain gauges, supplem ented by \\nbrittle lacquers and photo-elastic coatings.  The m ost useful data is obtained when strain gauges \\nor coatings are placed in areas of known high stress, such as fillet radii or in locations where \\nservice cracking has occurred.  However, strain gauges and surface coatings can only be used on \\nsurfaces that are directly accessible.  Internal or hidden surfaces (in joints, for exam ple) require \\n9 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\ntheoretical studies for stress evaluation.  Dynam ic measurem ents of the stress levels on parts \\nmay be obtained by using strain gauges installed on operating engines (usually in test cells). \\n \\n3-4. Engine Testing.    \\n \\n a. General.  An engine test intended to substantiate com pliance with § 33.19 should \\nconsider the following factors: \\n \\n   (1)  Fatigue Mechanism . Typically, reciprocating engine drive system  or structural part \\nfailure can be attributed to fatigue overload resulting from  a large num ber of stress cycles at a \\nlow level of overstress; this is referred to as “high cycle fatigue” (HCF).  Depending on its \\ndesign and function, the part m ay be m ost affected by either: \\n \\n    (a)  A forced vibratory response;  \\n \\n    (b)  A forced vibratory response in com bination with a resonant vibratory response; \\nor  \\n \\n    (c)  A forced vibratory response at high structural tem peratures. \\n \\n   (2)  Test Duration.  An engine test should expose the part to at least 10 m illion \\nsignificant stress cycles under the loading conditions representative of the relevant fatigue \\nmechanism .  This criterion is based on the fatigue strength characteristics of steel and cast \\nalum inum .  For steel parts, if  fatigue cracking has not initiated within 10 m illion stress cycles, \\nthen the parts will m ost likely last indef initely.  Cast alum inum  parts also exhibit a reduction of  \\nfatigue strength above 10 m illion cycles.  In addition, a safety m argin beyond the 10 m illion \\nstress cycles should be added to accom modate variations (or scatter) in the actual strengths of \\nproduction com ponents and differences between test and service operating conditions.  The test \\nduration should also be designed to represent the effect of the m aximum stress cycles on the \\nfatigue life of a part over a typical TBO range. \\n \\n b. Durability Test Types.  \\n \\n   (1)  Type 1 Tests. These tests are designed for parts whose prim ary fatigue m echanism  \\nis a forced vibratory response that is proportional to com bustion pressures and inertia loads.  The \\noperating condition m ost associated with this type of fatigue m echanism  is m aximum power \\noperation.  These tests are appropriate for part s in which high operating tem peratures do not \\nsignificantly affect the fatigue strength of the part. \\n \\n    (a)  Applicable Parts.  The reciprocating engine parts typically found to be m ost \\nsusceptible to this fatigue m echanism  include such parts as connecting rods, connecting rod \\nbolts, piston pins, rocker arm s, rocker shaft attachm ent bolts/studs, intake valves, cylinder \\nbarrels, crankshaft counterweights, valve push rods, valve spring retainers and keepers, \\ncamshafts, crankcases, crankcase through bolts and cylinder deck studs, and engine m ounts and \\nmount leg brackets .  The Type 1 tests m ay also be appropriate for other parts depending on the \\nspecific characteristics of the engine and part design.  \\n10 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\n \\n    (b)  Test Elem ents.  A Type 1 test should include both the 150-hour endurance test of \\n§ 33.49 and a unique durability test.  The unique durability test should consist of operation for \\n100 hours at take-off power with norm al CHT and EGT, plus operation for 50 hours at cruise \\npower with norm al tem peratures. \\n \\n   (2)  Type 2 Tests.   These tests are designed for parts whose prim ary fatigue m echanism  \\nis a forced vibratory response in com bination with a resonant vibratory response that occurs at \\nany engine speed at which the natural frequency of the part (or assem bly that includes the part) \\ncoincides with the frequency of a com bustion or inertia harm onic.  The engine speed at which a \\ncomponent experiences resonant vibration depends on its physical design and the im posed \\ndynam ic conditions resulting from  engine operation.  The part can be excited in a torsional m ode \\n(for exam ple, crankshafts) or a bending m ode (f or exam ple, brackets).  These resonances should \\nbe addressed by endurance testing at the engine speed and power condition that produces the \\npeak resultant resonant stress level as required by §33.43 (b) .  These tests are appropriate for \\nparts in which high operating tem peratures do not significantly affect the fatigue strength of the \\npart  \\n \\n    (a)  Applicable Parts.  The reciprocating engine parts typically found to be m ost \\nsusceptible to this fatigue m echanism  include such parts as crankshafts, propeller drive gears, \\nmain internal and m agneto gears, and driveline quill shaf ts.  The Type 2 tests m ay also be \\nappropriate for other parts depending on the specific characteristics of the engine and part \\ndesign.  \\n \\n    (b)  Test Elem ents.  A Type 2 should include three tests:  the 150-hour endurance \\ntest of § 33.49, the vibration test of § 33.43, and a unique durability test.  The unique durability \\ntest should consist of operation for 100 hours at take-off power with norm al CHT and EGT, plus \\noperation for 50 hours at cruise power with norm al tem peratures.  The vibration test should \\nconsist of operation for at least 10 m illion cycles at peak torsional resonance conditions (see \\n§ 33.43).  A typical torsional resonant frequency for a straight drive six-cylinder engine is \\naround 200 Hz, which translates into a durability test tim e of about 14 hours at the RPM at \\nwhich this resonant frequency occurs. \\n \\n   (3)  Type 3 Test.  These tests are designed for parts whose prim ary fatigue m echanism  \\nis a forced vibratory response at any engine power level whose effect on fatigue strength is \\naggravated by high structural tem peratures.  The operating conditions m ost associated with this \\ntype of fatigue m echanism  include both take-o ff and cruise power conditions.  During take-off \\nand clim b, maximum CHT m ay be experienced because the cooling airflow through the cowling \\nis reduced due to the “nose up” angle of attack and slower airspeed of the airplane.  During \\ncruise operation, m aximum EGT and turbine inlet tem perature (TIT) m ay occur because the \\nfuel/air ratio m ixture setting is leaned to im prove fuel econom y.  For engine bearings, high oil \\ntemperatures m ay also be a concern, especially at high power. \\n \\n    (a)  Applicable Parts.  The reciprocating engine parts typically found to be m ost \\nsusceptible to this f atigue m echanism  are pistons, exhaust valves, cylinder heads, connecting rod \\nand crankshaft m ain bearing inserts, exhaust system  tubes, and exhaust system  band clam ps and \\n11 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\nconnectors.  The Type 3 tests m ay also be a ppropriate for other parts depending on the specific \\ncharacteristics of the engine and part design.  \\n \\n    (b)  Test Elem ents.  A Type 3 test should include both the 150-hour endurance test of \\n§ 33.49 and a unique durability test.  The unique durability test should consist of two segm ents.  \\nThe first segm ent should include 100 hours at take-off power with fuel flow at the full rich lim it \\nspecified by the engine m anufacturer and with CHT and oil tem perature controlled to the \\nrequirem ents of § 33.49(a).  The second segm ent should include 150 hours at the m aximum \\ncruise power recom mended by the engine m anufactur er with fuel flow leaned to produce the \\nmaximum allowable EGT (or TIT for turbocharged engines). \\n \\n c. Similarity Analyses.  The m aterial strengt h of drive system  and structural reciprocating \\nengine parts m ay be dependent on the m anufacturi ng processes utilized in the production of that \\npart.  These processes are usually unique to a particular m anufacturer.  Sim ilar m anufacturing \\nprocesses perform ed by different m anufacturers should not be assum ed to produce identical \\nmaterial strength characteristics or stress levels in finished parts.  Therefore, the scope of \\nsimilarity analyses used for com pliance with § 33.19 should be based on the applicant’s specific \\ndesign and m anufacturing experience.  \\n \\n3-5. Pass/Fail Inspection Criteria .   \\n \\n a. Pass/Fail.  Following com pletion of a durability test, each com ponent being evaluated \\nshould be subjected to crack inspections in addition to the norm al wear/distortion m easurem ents.  \\nThe basic pass/fail criteria should be that each part is in good serviceable condition. Any \\nabnorm ality such as cracking or unusual wear/distortion (significantly outside service lim its) \\nshould generally result in a reevaluation of the design of the part.  One possible exception is \\ncracks that are classed as superficial, m eet the engine m anufacturer’s service requirem ents for \\ncontinued use, and have also been shown by service history not to result in flight safety issues.  \\nCooling fins on cast alum inum  cylinder heads (not barrels) are an exam ple of an area in which \\ncracking m ay be acceptable on som e designs. \\n \\n b. Inspections.  The following inspections are com monly used for crack detection and \\nshould be standard practice.  The actual technique used depends on the com ponent being \\nexam ined: \\n \\n   (1)  Magnetic Particle Inspection (MPI) for m agnetic com ponents. \\n \\n   (2)  Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI) for non-m agnetic com ponents. \\n \\n   (3)  Ultrasonic Inspection (U/T) for crankshafts, as specified by the engine \\nmanufacturer. \\n \\n   (4)  X-ray radiography. \\n \\n c. Inspection of Interfacing Engine Parts.  Other engine parts that are adjacent to, \\nconnected to, or functionally related to the redesigned part m ay be exam ined for any signs of \\n12 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\nstructural failure or unusual wear.  This ensures that the redesigned part does not have an adverse \\nderivative affect on other engine parts. \\n \\n d. Com ponent Structural Com plexity Issues.  Cracking m ay not be readily detectable on \\nparts with a com plex assem bly or shape.  In such parts, a crack m ay only becom e apparent when \\nit is well developed, potentially when developed to the point of total com ponent failure.   \\n \\n   (1)  The following parts have com plex shapes or assem blies: \\n \\n    (a)  Piston pins.  These com ponents are considered com plex due to the hidden inner \\nsurface in som e designs. \\n \\n    (b)  Cylinder assem blies.  These assem blies are considered com plex due to the \\nvarious hidden surfaces and also due to the poor visibility in sm all radius fin roots on both head \\nand barrel. \\n \\n   (2)  These com ponents m ay be sectioned before MPI or FPI as follows: \\n \\n    (a)  Piston pins.  Section piston pins lengthwise along a diam eter to expose the inner \\nsurface. \\n \\n    (b)  Cylinder assem blies.   \\n \\n           1.  Rem ove the cylinder fins and inspect the fin root areas for cracking. \\n \\n           2.  Rem ove valve seats, valve guides, and rocker arm  shaft bushings (if so-\\nequipped) and inspect the surfaces behind these parts. \\n \\n           3.  Section cylinder assem blies lengthwise by m aking two cuts along diam eters \\nat right angles to expose threaded joint surfaces, edges of fin roots, and port interiors. \\n \\n3-6. Other Methods of Durability Substantiation .  This AC provides m ethods, but not the only \\nmethods, of com pliance with the durability requirem ent.  Other m ethods that could be used in \\nplace of som e or all of the testing described in this AC include the following: \\n \\n a. Accelerated or “lead the fleet” flight-t esting to rapidly accum ulate operating hours in \\nadvance of introducing the part to service. \\n \\n b. Extensive experim ental bench testing of the part to evaluate the m aterial strength. \\n \\n c. Finite elem ent analysis to evaluate applied loads on the part.  This type of analysis \\nshould be correlated and validated with testing or service experience with a sim ilar part. \\n \\n \\n \\n//Original signed by FAF on 9/27/04// \\n13 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\nFrancis A.

MATERIAL AND PROCESS CHANGES ON REDESIGNED PARTS  \\n \\nA1-1. General .   \\n \\n a. Drive system  and structural parts m ay have sm all m argins of safety that result from  \\noperation at high stress levels relative to their m aterial strength.  Many redesigns include \\nchanges in m aterials or m anufacturing processes relative to the original design part.  The m argin \\nof safety m ay be eroded if careful attention isn’t paid to the effects these changes m ay have on \\nthe m aterial strength or stress levels. Considera tion should be given to the following effects that \\nmaterial or process changes m ay have on the redesigned part:   \\n \\n   (1)  A local increase in stress caused by cracks, nicks, gouges, laps, rough surfaces, thin \\nsections, undersize fillet radii, coarse porosity, or gross inclusions. \\n \\n   (2)  Reductions in strength, wear resistance, or corrosion resistance caused by coarse \\nmicrostructure, low hardness, inappropriate heat treatm ents or surface treatm ents. \\n14 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\n \\n b. The precise effects of these factors m ay be difficult to quantify in term s of stress or \\nstrength.  In addition, m any of these characteristics are difficult to detect or evaluate by \\nanalytical m ethods.  For these and other reasons (related to dim ensional and operational \\nvariables), substantial reliance should be placed on representative durability testing during \\ncertification of drive system  and stru ctural reciprocating engine parts. \\n \\n c. These factors should also be considered when the extent of the redesign is lim ited to a \\nchange in m aterial. \\n \\nA1-2. Factors That Increase Stress .  The following factors m ay affect m ean (steady state) \\nstresses and operational (dynam ic) stresses:  \\n \\n a. Surface treatm ent processes (such as carburizing, nitriding, and shot peening) that \\nintroduce beneficial surface stresses m ay also cause increased residual tensile stresses in the \\ncore.  This can be especially significant in thin sections of parts.  \\n \\n b. Prestress in bolted joints, which is generally beneficial if it is not excessive. \\n \\n c. Straightening, which can result in residual stresses and risk of cracking. \\n \\n d. Welding or brazing, which can cause residual stresses. \\n \\n e. Dimensional changes.  \\n \\n f.  Interference fits (assem bly stresses). \\n \\n g. Reduced cross-sectional areas, including wall thicknesses, which can cause increased \\noperational stresses and m ean stresses. \\n \\n h. Manufacturing-related stress raisers, which can cause increased operational stresses.  \\nManufacturing processes that produce surface stress raisers should norm ally be discovered \\nduring exam ination of test articles by visual observation and crack inspection procedures.  \\nSubsurface stress raisers resulting in m aterial strength issues are largely controlled by process \\ndefinition and control, and supported by destructive sam pling procedures.  Manufacturing related \\nstress raisers include the f ollowing: \\n \\n   (1)  Nicks, deep scratches, and gouges; \\n \\n   (2)  Gross porosity, large inclusions, cold shuts, and hot tears (castings); \\n \\n   (3)  Laps and inclusions (forgings); \\n \\n   (4)  Sharp edges; \\n \\n   (5)  Corrosion pits; \\n15 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\n \\n   (6)  Cracks; \\n \\n   (7)  Overly rough surface finishes; and \\n \\n   (8)  Undersize fillet radii. \\n \\nA1-3. Factors That Reduce Strength .  Most of the following factors are especially significant in \\ntheir effect on fatigue strength, a m ajor design c onsideration for reciprocating engine parts.  \\n \\n  a. Low hardness (specifically true for steel s; less significant for cast alum inum  alloys).  \\nLow hardness is com monly associated with the of heat treatm ent processes.  \\n \\n  b. Coarse m icrostructure/grain size, advers ely affecting static strength, fatigue strength, \\nand toughness.  Coarse m icrostructure/grain size is com monly associated with the tem peratures \\nlevels during casting and forging operations, duri ng norm alizing (for steels), or during the heat \\ntreatm ent processes.  \\n \\n  c. Levels of  impurities, inclusions, or porosity (castings).  \\n \\n  d. Decarburization of steel surfaces, causi ng a soft, low-strength surface layer.  \\nDecarburization of steel surfaces is typically a ssociated with the tem perature levels during \\nforging operations; som e decarburization m ay be acceptable.  \\n \\n  e. Inappropriately specified surface treatm ents such as carburizing, nitriding, and shot \\npeening.  \\n \\n  f. Inappropriately specified plating tr eatm ents of high strength steels, resulting in \\nhydrogen em brittlem ent. \\n \\n  g. Inappropriately specified joining processes such as welding or brazing, which exhibit \\nincom plete fill or, in the case of welding, local section reduction. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n16 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nAPPENDIX 2.  NOTES ON MATERIAL STRENGTH EVALUATION \\n \\nA2-1. Metallographic Analysis.   In com bination with chem istry and hardness data, \\nmetallographic analysis is a fundam ental tool for assessing m aterial properties.  The \\nmetallographic inspection m ay be expected to provide inform ation of a basic m icrostructural \\nnature, including grain structure, the presence or absence of unusual intergranular conditions, \\nporosity, and inclusions in the area sectioned.  However, there are lim its to the am ount of \\ninform ation that can be obtained during a gene ral m etallographic evaluation.  The inform ation \\ngathered depends on the scope of the evaluation.  Com ponent idiosyncrasies m ay go undetected \\nwithout a thorough understanding of the m anufacturi ng processes.  Changes in m icrostructure \\nbetween “good” and “bad” m aterial perform ance are som etimes so subtle as to be \\nindistinguishable. \\n \\nA2-2. Microstructural Analysis .  There are several im portant characteristics that a general \\nmicrostructural evaluation m ay miss or, if detected, m ay not thoroughly assess in term s of \\ncomponent strength.  The following list represents exam ples of several areas of analytical \\ndifficulties: \\n \\n  a. Detection of hydrogen em brittlem ent.  \\n \\n17 \\nAC 33.19-1    9/27/04 \\n  b. Detection of non-hom ogeneous m icrostructure.  \\n \\n  c. Evaluation of directional properties. \\n \\n  d. Effects of section thickness on the properties of low alloy, high hardenability steels. \\n \\n  e. Detection of local nitrided surface case depth reduction (resulting from  \\ngrinding/overpolishing). \\n \\n  f. Evaluation of decarburized layer thickness in term s of its effect on the fatigue strength \\nof forged steel com ponents. \\n \\n  g. Evaluation of cast alum inum  microstructural and m acrostructural variations and their \\neffects on com ponent fatigue strength. \\n \\nA2-3.  Material Strength Reference Data .   \\n \\n  a. A large am ount of basic m aterial strength data is available in reference books.  \\nAlthough very valuable, the data, especially that on fatigue strength, should be used cautiously.  \\nReports published in the handbooks of the Am erican Society for Metals (ASM) indicate that \\nthere are significant problem s in establishing or confirm ing fatigue strengths by relying on \\nreference data.  “The Selection of Steel for Fa tigue Resistance” reports that although the fatigue \\nstrength of steel is usually in proportion to the tensile strength, this generalization does not hold \\nin many instances and is not true over wide ranges of tensile strength.  “Alum inum Alloy \\nCastings: Mechanical Properties” states that the fatigue strength of cast alum inum  is m arkedly \\ndependent on the casting process.  It further states that actual fatigue testing of fully m achined \\ncast alum inum  parts is the only m ethod of alloy or  process selection.  “Fatigue Resistance of \\nSteels” states that: “Fatigue tests perform ed on sm all specim ens are not sufficient for precisely \\nestablishing the fatigue life of a part.”  “Fatigue Failures” discusses fatigue failures and \\nprediction of fatigue life and includes m any of th e variables affecting fatigue life.  It also \\nidentifies that standard fatigue life data (as norm ally presented in reference books) is usually \\nbased on the m edian life of the specim ens tested.  In addition, it refers to the significant scatter \\nassociated with such fatigue life values. \\n \\n  b. Nevertheless, estim ates of basic m aterial fatigue strength should be an essential part of \\nthe design or redesign processes; laboratory-derive d fatigue data should be used to support this \\nevaluation.  W hen calculating safety factors, avoid overestim ating fatigue strengths.  The values \\nused should reflect the lower lim its of data scatter, rather than m edian values, when possible.  \\nThe fatigue test data presented in curves in the ASM Metals Handbook  reports is valuable for \\nassessing alloy steel and cast alum inum  fatigue strength scatter.  Fatigue strength estim ates \\nshould also include the effects of such param eters as m ean stresses, stress concentrations, surface \\nfinishes, and structural tem peratures. \\n \\n  c. Com plex com ponents, such as cylinder assem blies, that depend significantly on \\nassem bly procedures for their strength present an additional difficulty in estim ating fatigue \\nstrengths (or lives).  The durability of such assem blies cannot be fully evaluated based only on \\n18 \\n9/27/04     AC 33.19-1 \\ntheir individual com ponent m aterial properties.  Due to uncertainties and operational variables \\nthat m ay affect stress and strength, com ponent analysis should be supported by durability testing. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n19 \\n \\n \\n \\nU.S. Department \\nof Transportation Federal Aviation \\nAdministration  Advisory \\nCircular  \\n \\n   \\nSubject:   Manufacturing Processes for \\nPremium Quality Nickel Alloy for Engine \\nRotating Parts  Date:  2/4/11  \\nInitiated by:  ANE-111  AC No:  33.15-2  \\n \\n \\n1.

The manufacture of nickel-base allo y forged rotating components can introduce \\ncomponent life limiting anomalies at all stages  of material processing.  To limit these \\nanomalies, the manufacturing process must be es tablished so that, at each stage, appropriate \\ncontrols and inspections minimize occurrence and maximize detection, of such anomalies. \\nFurther, only through using the best availa ble technologies, can the goals of adequate \\nprevention and detection be met.    b. The conventional melting process for nickel-base alloys has been the VIM process, followed by the ESR and/or VAR processes.  Triple melt (VIM + ESR + VAR) INCO 718 \\nrotor material has demonstrated significantl y fewer melt-related anomalies than double melt \\n(VIM+VAR) INCO718 material, and we recommend using triple melt processes in critical \\nrotating components.  Improvements in all st ages of melt, remelt,  and conversion have \\nresulted in a significant reduction in the occu rrence of melt-related defects since the mid-\\n1980\\'s.    c. Section 33.15(b) requires that materials used in the engine conform to specifications \\nthat ensure they have the streng th and other properties assumed in the design data.  To achieve \\nthis goal, inspection practices must advance in st ep with the best availa ble technologies.  The \\nfrequency and size of the anomalies tolerate d in the rotating com ponent design and lifing \\nanalysis must also be consistent with the levels observed in the materials.   d. Advisory Circulars 21-1B, 21-6A, 21- 9A, 21-27, and 21.303-2H provide a means to \\nobtain and maintain production approvals.  Th ese ACs, however, do not fully describe the \\nmanufacturing processes used in the manufacture of premiu m quality, nickel-base, alloy-\\nforged rotating components for type certificated tu rbine engines.  This AC, therefore, provides \\nsupplemental guidance for the establishment of manufacturing processes, in-process material \\nand component inspections, and finished com ponent inspections, for the manufacture of \\npremium quality, nickel-base, al loy-forged rotating components, such as disks, spacers, hubs, \\nshafts, spools and impellers (not blades).  \\n5 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n6. General. \\n \\n \\na Sections 139 and 143 of 14 CFR part 21 require that production approval holders \\nestablish and maintain, as appropr iate, quality control systems th at ensure that products used \\nin type certificated engines conf orm to the FAA-approved type design. \\n  b. PAHs should also ensure, through appropria te agreements with their suppliers, that \\neffective process control documen ts are developed that identi fy significant process control \\npoints, parameters, and control limits.    c. The PAH and its suppliers must establish a method to document and approve changes to the process control documents and the means of hand ling violations of any control \\nlimit(s).  Manufacturing process steps where in clusions could be formed or entrapped, \\nsegregations generated, or porosity induced, should be particularly detailed for methods of control, monitoring, and detection.   d. Records of the following should be maintained and available for review as long as the parts made from this material are in service:    (1) material and component inspection;     (2) disposition results;     (3) property test results;    (4) traceability of forged co mponents to ingot/b illet location; \\n   (5) material heat; and    (6)  raw material ingredie nt lots making up the heat.  \\n  e. New melters and raw material supplier s and their processes should be adequately \\nqualified.   f. The PAH and its suppliers must estab lish a system of handling deviations and non-\\nconformances with respect to  product or part limits. \\n  g. Each supplier must establish and docume nt a system for conducting internal self-\\naudits.  7. Raw Materials and Storage.   Melt suppliers must maintain effective specifications and \\nprocedures for procurement, id entification, storage, and proce ssing of charge materials for \\nVacuum Induction Melting.  The raw material su pplier must inspect its raw material on a \\nsampling plan sufficiently to ensure compliance with melt supplier raw material procurement specifications.  The melt supplier should also inspect sufficient raw material to verify conformance to its procurement specifications and should maintain those inspection records \\nfor an appropriate period of time. \\n6 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n \\n \\na. Charge Composition.  The charge materi als must be composed of only approved raw \\nmaterials, such as elemental additions, master alloys, refining agents and recycle material.  \\nThe weight percent, chemical composition, batc h or lot number, and sequence of addition of \\neach type of raw material used in the charge materials must be recorded and maintained for \\neach heat of material.   b. Elemental Additions.  Process elemen tal additions to preclude or remove \\ncontaminants considered to cause deleterious incl usions or to adversely affect the properties \\nof the alloy.   c. Master Alloys.  Master alloy suppliers must have established procedures and limits \\nfor the production of high-purity master alloy.  Ma ster alloys must be inspected to established \\nstandards to identify and remove detrimental foreign material, oxides, nitrides, and other \\ncontaminants considered to cause deleterious inclusions.  Ceramics used in VIM crucibles, tundishes, etc., must be controlled.  The melt supplier and the PAH must establish and agree upon chemistry for each master alloy grade.   d. Refining agents.  Both metallic and nonmetallic additions must meet established chemistry specifications and shoul d be inspected for conformity. \\n  e. Recycle Material.  All recycle ma terials must be cleaned and free from \\ncontamination.  The following limitations must be considered when recycling previously \\nmelted alloy:    (1) Solid scrap may be used directly in the VIM furnace charge, providing the solid \\nscrap has been cleaned (as necessary) and checked for alloy identity. \\n   (2) Chips and turnings may be charged eith er in loose or consolidated form if they \\nhave been previously cleaned to a defined sta ndard and the scrap proce ssor has certified them \\nas to their chemistry.    (3) Lower grade scrap such as grindings, furnace skulls, solids contaminated with slag, or heavily oxidized solids may be used provided they are first refined by EAF/AOD or \\nother techniques to produce a solid refined shap e, such as a pig or ingot with a certified \\nchemistry.   f. Raw Material Storage.  Store all virgin raw material and turnings in covered \\ncontainers in a secure area immediately after in spection to preclude the extraneous addition of \\nforeign or uninspected material.  Stored raw materials must be adequately marked with \\nidentification to avoid any inadvertent misuse.   g. TIG welding.  TIG welding is a comm on industrial practice for welding alloy \\ncomponents.  Tungsten is a very high melting point metal that may inadvertently be incorporated into the melt/remelt ingot and included  in the final part.  To avoid this, suppliers \\nmust establish procedures for TIG welding used to manufacture or repair equipment used to \\n7 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\nstore o\\nr process nickel-base al loys.  Do not use TIG welding to attach remelt electrodes to \\nstubs. \\n \\n8. Melting and Remelting.  \\n \\n a. This section details significant pro cess parameters, controls and procedures \\nrecommended in input material consolida tion and ingot melting for the production of \\npremium quality nickel-base al loys.  These items are recommended guidelines which, when \\nincorporated into a supplier’s specific manu facturing method, will minimize freckle and white \\nspot and produce sound ingots with acceptable chemistry and homogeneity.  Triple melt (VIM+ESR+VAR) INCO718 alloy contains signif icantly fewer melt-related anomalies than \\ndouble melt (VIM+VAR) INCO718, and the FAA recomm ends triple melt for critical rotating \\ncomponents.     b. Vacuum Induction Melting.    (1) Charge make-up.  Establish aim limits for the weight percent and chemical composition of the following types of charge make up materials used in a VIM heat:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 elemental raw materials; \\n\\uf0b7 master alloy; \\n\\uf0b7 solid scrap; \\n\\uf0b7 turnings, and \\n\\uf0b7 pig. \\n   (2) The VIM process must produce electrodes capable of either being remelted directly in VAR or ESR remelted first, followed by a VAR step.  The resultant billet/bar product must be free from inclusions, rejectab le segregation, and melt-related structural \\nimperfections.    (3) Refractories.  Refractor y (oxide) materials that come in contact with the molten \\nmetal, such as furnace linings, spouts, tundishes, launders and pouring pads, must be procured and processed to specifications that cover ma terial supplier, material composition, handling, \\nmethod of manufacture, and fabrication.  Inspect  refractory materials after each heat and \\nreplace them when deleterious deterioration is noted.     (4) VIM Crucible.  The VIM crucible must be prepared to an established procedure and inspected prior to melting rotor grade mate rial to ensure the crucible is clean and \\nundamaged.  Sequence heats in the crucible to  an established pro cedure to preclude \\ncontamination of follow-on heats.     (5) VIM Mold Preparation.  The VIM mold must be dedicated for nickel-base alloys \\nor have a documented procedure for conditioni ng the electrode surface prior to ESR.  A \\nsurface conditioning procedure is required for all VAR electrodes.  Materials used in the mold \\nassembly and the method of mold preparation and assembly must be to a documented procedure.  Clean and inspect electrode mold s prior to use to a documented procedure to \\nensure they are free from rust, oil, gr ease, coatings and nonmetallic materials. \\n8 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n \\n \\n (6) VIM Melt Parameter Controls. Chambe r pressure, metal te mperature and power \\ninput must be continuously measured and record ed during the melting cycle.  Establish limits \\nat the designated control point s for the following parameters: \\n    (a) Leak rate and pressure for the furnace chamber prior to power on.     (b) Furnace pressure during back charging.     (c) Metal temperature during refining.     (d) Furnace pressure and difference betw een consecutive leak rates to indicate \\nthe end of refining.     (e) Furnace pressure while making alloy additions.     (f) Metal temperature and stir time after alloy additions.     (g) The percentage dross coverage on the top of the molten metal after all alloy \\nadditions have been made and th e stir power is turned off. \\n    (h) Record metal temperature, furnace pressure and stir power input during the \\naddition of volatile elements.     (i) Maximum time from the addition of volatile elements to start of pour. \\n \\n   (j) Metal pour temperature, pour rate , and time from the st art to the end of \\npour. \\n    (k) Molten metal level in the tundish during the pour.     (l) Chemical composition of th e VIM heat at the start of pour. \\n    (m) Time from end pour to open mold chamber to the atmosphere.     (n) Time from end pour to strip molds from electrodes.     (o) Record of the introduction of any inert gasses added to the VIM heat. \\n    (p) Time from pouring and stripping of  mold to heat treat, cooling pits or \\nboxes.    (7) VIM Tundish.  Material  must be processed through a tundish that removes, by \\nflotation and/or filt ration, non-metallic contamination films and exogenous materials and \\nrestricts them from entering the electrode molds.  \\n9 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n \\n (8) VIM Hot Topping.  When performing hot topping, VIM ingots must be hot \\ntopped to an established procedure using materi als and controls specified in the supplier’s \\nprocedure.  Remove all contaminated hot top ma terial or compound prior to remelt.  If not hot \\ntopped, VIM ingots should have open pipe cove red after stripping to prevent contamination. \\n \\n c. Electroslag Remelting.    (1) ESR Processing.  Melting sources must  maintain effective controls for the ESR \\nprocesses to consistently produce uniform ingot s that yield billet/bar material free from \\ndeleterious voids, segregation, a nd inclusions and to meet the chemistry requirements of the \\nmaterial specification.  The electrode diameter , melting procedures, and acceptance standards \\nmust be established and documented.     (2) VIM Electrode Preparation.  Electrode  surfaces must be conditioned to remove \\nsurface irregularities and previous melt contam inants that would affect ESR processing or \\ncontaminate the electrode during remelt.  If th e VIM molds are not dedicated for nickel-base \\nalloys, the electrode conditioning practice must be in accordance with a documented \\nprocedure.  The ESR melter must establish acceptance criteria that must include provisions to \\ncontrol the annulus.  Photographic or written standards for the conditioned surface must be \\ndefined and applied.    (3) Electrode cropping.  If cropping of th e electrode exposes pipe, shield the cut \\nface to ensure no exogenous material enters the cavity prior to melting.  Residual pipe \\ndiameter and depth dimensions must be establ ished and met prior to remelting the electrode. \\n   (4) ESR Stub Welding.  Conduct electro de stub welding in accordance with a \\ndocumented procedure that prevents exogenous ma terials associated with the welding process \\nfrom entering the ESR furnace.  Do not us e the TIG welding process for stub welding. \\n   (5) Crucible and Stub Cleaning.  Examin e the crucible and stubs before each use \\nand clean them in accordance with a documented procedure to remove foreign material.  The procedure should describe conditi ons that do not require cleaning. \\n   (6) ESR Slag.     (a) Slag chemistry and weight.  Li mits for chemical composition and initial \\nweight of the slag must be established for in itial slag charge and for any process additions. \\n    (b) Hot slag start.  Establish limits for the slag melting time or temperature, chemistry, and weight.  The limits must ensure  proper slag chemistry and prevent excessive \\ncarbon pickup from the slag-melting crucible.     (c) Cold slag start.  Establish lim its for chemistry and weight.  Storage and \\nhandling of the slag and its constitu ents must prevent moisture pickup. \\n  \\n10 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n \\n  (d) Protective atmosphere.  An inert gas cover may be used to prevent loss of \\noxidizable elements during ESR. Gas type, mi nimum flow, and the method used to lay the \\natmosphere over the slag must be  to an established procedure. \\n \\n   (e) Slag additions.  When used, slag additions must be made continuously at a \\nrate prescribed in the established procedure.  Monitor the slag addition system to ensure that blockage, spillage, or surges do not occur.    (7) Starter Material.  The configuration for starting a melt must be to a documented \\nprocedure.  Starter materi al should be as follows: \\n    (a) Cold start.  Same comp osition as the alloy to be melted. \\n    (b) Hot Start.  A different alloy may be used if it can be demonstrated that no \\nstarter material is picked up in the final product.     (c) Starter pellets or tablets must not be used. \\n    (d)  Take appropriate measures to ensu re that the ESR starter material (plate) is \\nin firm contact with the base plate.    (8) Crucible shielding.  Shield the open top of the ESR furnace crucible in a manner \\nthat prevents exogenous material from falling in to the crucible during the remelting process. \\n   (9) ESR Melt Parameter Controls.  Current and voltage must be continuously measured and recorded during the melting cycle.   Melt rate must be continuously measured \\nand recorded during the melting cycle.  Voltage  or resistance swing mu st be used in the \\nelectrode position contro l system.  Establish limits at the designated control points for the \\nfollowing parameters:     (a) Current and power voltage/resistance during start up and transient to steady \\nstate conditions.     (b) Swing voltage/resistance and melt ra te during the quasi-steady state or main \\nsegment of the melting program.     (c) Current or power or melt rate voltage/resistance during transient from steady state to the end of the melt.    (10) Ingot Cooling.  Establish a procedur e to uniformly and consistently cool the \\nsolidifying ingot.  Also, establis h limits for inlet a nd outlet crucible water temperature and \\nwater flow rate.   d. Vacuum Arc Remelting.    (1) Melting Control.  The VAR melter must maintain effective controls for \\nconsistently producing uniform i ngots that yield billet and bar material free from deleterious \\n11 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\nvoids, segregation and inclusi ons.  The electrod\\ne diameter, melting procedures, start up and \\nhot top practices, and acceptance standard s must be established and documented. \\n \\n  (2) VIM Ingot Preparation.  Electrode surfaces must be conditioned to remove \\nsurface irregularities and previous melt contam inants that would affect VAR processing or \\ncontaminate the electrode during remelt.  The electrode conditioning pr actice must be in \\naccordance with a documented procedure.  The VAR melter must establish acceptance criteria \\nthat includes provisions to cont rol the annulus.  Photographic or written standards for the \\nconditioned surface must be  defined and applied. \\n   (3) ESR Ingot Processing.  If the ESR ingot is to be forged to a smaller diameter, \\nthe conversion must be performed to an estab lished procedure.  Electrode surfaces must be \\nconditioned to remove scale and slag.  Acceptanc e criteria must be established and should \\ninclude provisions to control the annulus a nd photographic and/or wri tten standards for the \\nconditioned surface.    (4) Electrode Cutting.  Procedures must be established to define cutting method, \\nstandard crop head and toe crop lengths,  conditions requiring additional cropping and \\nsquareness of cut ends, and straightness in th e case of forge back electrodes.  Residual \\nelectrode pipe diameter and de pth dimensions must be establ ished and met prior to remelting \\nthe electrode.    (5) Electrode Stub Welding.  Conduct elect rode stub welding in accordance with a \\ndocumented procedure that prevents exogenous ma terials associated with the welding process \\nfrom entering the VAR crucible.  Do not use the TIG welding pr ocess for stub welding. \\n \\n  (6) Electrode Stub Cleaning.  Stubs must  be dedicated for nickel-base alloys.  A \\ndocumented procedure for cleaning and insp ecting the stub prior to use is required. \\n \\n  (7) Crucible Cleaning.  Clean and inspect the crucible prio r to each use in \\naccordance with a documented procedure.    (8) Furnace.  The furnace must be dedicated for nickel-base alloys unless a procedure for rigorously cleaning and inspecti ng the furnace head prior to each campaign of \\nnickel-base alloys is established.  Clean and inspect the furnace in accordance with a documented procedure.  The procedure must describe any conditions  that do not require \\ncleaning.    (9) Hot Top Markers.  If hot top mark ers are used, there must be a documented \\nprocedure.    (10) VAR Melt Parameter controls.  Process parameters such as furnace pressure, current, voltage, ram travel, melt rate, and th e frequency and duration of transient over-\\nvoltage pulses or transient arc short circuits (pulse rate/drip short) must be continually \\nmeasured and recorded during the melting cycle.  Actual melt rate must be calculated. Establish limits at the designated control points for the following parameters:  \\n12 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n \\n  (a) Furnace pressure and leak rate prior to power on. \\n \\n   (b) Furnace pressure, voltage, and curr ent profile during start up and transient \\nto steady state conditions.     (c) Furnace pressure, current, voltage melt rate, melt rate excursions, and the \\nfrequency and duration of transi ent over voltage pulses or transient arc short circuits (pulse \\nrate/drip short) during the qua si-steady state or main segm ent of the melting program. \\n    (d) Electrode weight or length at the start of the hot top sequence. \\n    (e) Furnace pressure, voltage and the current profile during the transient from quasi-steady state to the end of the melt.     (f) Inert gas (i.e. helium) cooling gas pressure and flow.     (g) Water flow rate and inlet and exit temperatures.     (h) Drip short control parameters.    (11) Ingot cooling.  The VAR source must develop procedures to uniformly and consistently cool the solidifyi ng ingot.  Limits should be es tablished for inlet and outlet \\ncrucible water temperature, water flow rate, inert gas type, and pressure or flow rate. \\n \\n9. Billet/Bar Conversion, Disk Forgin g, and Nondestructive Testing (NDT). \\n \\n a. Control of Bill et/Bar Manufacture. \\n \\n  (1) Conversion Process.  Specific detaile d procedures must exist for the conversion \\nof ingot to billet and bar pr oducts.  These must include, but are not necessarily limited to: \\n    (a) Billet/Bar Conversion.  Perfor m ingot to billet/bar conversion using \\ncontrolled, consistent, and detailed procedures.      1\\n  Ingot Conditioning.  Establish documented procedures for conditioning \\nthe ingot surface prior to heating for forging.      2\\n  Forge Parameter Control.  Develop and use documented procedures to \\ncontrol ingot and billet/b ar products.  These procedures mu st include, but are not limited to: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Homogenization time and temperat ure and cooling procedure for \\npreforge soaking \\n\\uf0b7 Forge furnace temperatures/atmospheres \\n\\uf0b7 Soak times \\n\\uf0b7 Amount of draft \\n\\uf0b7 Reduction schedules/sequences \\n\\uf0b7 Quench time, media, and methods \\n13 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n\\uf0b7 Die type \\n\\uf0b7 Single or double end procedures \\n\\uf0b7 Off-die procedures \\n \\n    3   Forge Practice.  Develop forge practices which preclude formation of \\nstrain induced porosity (SIP) or clean voids.      4\\n  Records.  Maintain reduction sizes,  sequences, and temperature records. \\n    (b) Traceability.  Billet must be traceable to location and orientation in the VAR ingot.  Bar must be traceable to the fina l VAR ingot and at least to the top, or bottom \\nhalf of the cropped ingot, and to a section of the original ingot not to exceed 3000 pounds. \\n   (2) Cropping.  Any ingot conversion must incorporate a minimum crop of the ingot \\nextremities.  Limits for crop lengths should be established to account for the bottom charge and hot topping procedures used for the final melting.   b. Control of Disk/Component Manufacture.    (1) Forging/Heat Treatment Process.  Specific detailed procedures must exist for the production of finished rotating components from b illet product.  These should include but are \\nnot necessarily limited to:     (a) Forging Controls.  Controlled, cons istent, and detailed procedures must be \\nestablished for the control of the forging proce ss.  These must include but are not limited to: \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Furnace loading diagram for each operation; \\n\\uf0b7 Strain profile for each part made; strain may be defined through controlled \\nram speeds and load/stroke parameters; \\n\\uf0b7 Standard die designation for each forging operation; \\n\\uf0b7 Forging mult weight and diameter; and \\n\\uf0b7 To die and off-die transfer times from furnace and to cooling station \\nrespectively. \\n    (b) Thermal Controls.  Documented procedures must be es tablished for control \\nof forge/soaking furnace temperature and times.     (c) Heat Treatment Controls.  Docume nted procedures must be established for \\nthe control of heat treatment furnaces, atmospheres, times and temperatures.     (d) Quenching.  Quench practice and coo ling rates must be controlled to ensure \\nfreedom from quenc h related cracking. \\n    (e) Traceability.  Traceability of forgi ngs and bar products to billet location \\nmust be maintained.  \\n14 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n   (f) \\nRecords.  Reduction sizes, sequences, and temperature records must be \\nmaintained. \\n  c. Nondestructive Testing and Criteria.    (1) To obtain further confidence that nick el-base alloy rotating parts are free from \\npotentially detrimental anomalies, NDT must be  performed at appropria te stages throughout \\nbillet/bar and component manufacture.  These inspections must be chosen based on melting, \\nbillet conversion, heat treatment, and forgi ng processes used and part requirements.  \\nControlled procedures must define the inspec tion processes and acceptance criteria.  Consider \\nthe following NDT inspections:      (a) Billet/Bar.      1\\n  Immersion ultrasonic testing.  \\n     2\\n  Macroetch inspection of billet/bar e nds and slices adjacent to ultrasonic \\ncrops.      (b) Forging.      1\\n  Immersion ultrasonic testing.  \\n     2\\n  Macroetch of sonic or inte rmediate machined forgings.  \\n    (c) Finish Machined Component. \\n   \\n    1\\n  Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection.  \\n   (2) Ultrasonic Testing (UT) Criteria.  The criteria for UT of billet/bar and forgings should consider the operational and control requirements that materials/ultrasonic inspection \\nsystems must achieve.  The criteria should include but are not n ecessarily limited to: \\n    (a) System Variability.  Materials sy stems from billet/bar  through forging, heat \\ntreatment, and machining should be engineered so  that materials-genera ted ultrasonic noise or \\nboundary (surface finish) ultrasound transmission  characteristics do not interfere with \\ndetectability of potentially detrimenta l anomalies.  Conduct periodic system \\nreliability/repeatability studies to ensure instrumentation and standards are functioning \\nproperly and within calibration.     (b) Test Blocks.  Test blocks must  be manufactured using material with \\nfabrication and ultrasonic characteristics similar to  those of the billet or forging being tested.  \\nDocument calibration procedures adequately to verify the pr oper operation of the ultrasonic \\ninspection system.   \\n15 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n  (3) \\nAcceptance Limit.  When using scanning systems, set the acceptance limit \\nappropriately (at least 3 db) a bove the noise level to minimize false calls while maintaining \\ndetection sensitivity consistent with design requirements.   \\n   (4) Records.  Retain electronic data (p referred) or equivalent  strip charts according \\nto the engine manufacturer\\'s FAA- approved records retention schedule. \\n  d. Actions Following Indication Detection.    (1) Ultrasonic Indication Characteriza tion of unacceptable indications should be \\nconducted on billet/bar, forgings or finished  parts, as appropriate.  Report unacceptable \\nindications found in the forging and finished parts to the JETQC (Jet Engine Titanium \\nCommittee) in accordance with JETQC practi ces.  At a minimum, report the following \\ninformation for all indications:     (a) Defect type;     (b) Cross-section defect size;     (c) Cross-section void/crack size, if any;     (d) Ultrasonic inspection calibration and test procedures;     (e) Ultrasonic amplitude;     (f) Ultrasonic signal-to-noise  ratio (SNR), if available; and \\n    (g) Indication location in the billet/forging.    (2) For metallic inclusions, report the following additional information: \\n    (a) Microhardness; and     (b) Scanning electron microscope a nd/or microprobe evaluation: nature of \\nconstituents, fractography of void/crack.    (3) Indications Detected In Billet/Bar.     (a) Freckle after all Crops.  Review  any heat which is shown by billet/bar \\ninspection and indication characterization to contain a freckl e.  Consider rejecting any heat \\ncontaining a freckle for a critic al rotating part application unless a special cause can be \\ndetermined which would allow only partial rejecti on of the heat. \\n    (b) Other Anomalies.  Evaluate use of heats with any other anomalies on an \\nindividual basis.  \\n16 \\n2/4/11     AC 33.15-2 \\n17   (4) Indications Detected in Forgings and Finished Parts.  The Production Approval \\nHolder should take appr opriate action upon finding and characterizing unacceptable \\nindications in forgings and fini shed parts.  Action regarding suspect material should be based \\non historical experience with th e process and may include, but is not necessarily limited to, \\nover-inspections of parts from heats, lots, batche s, etc., that contain th e forging or part with \\nthe anomaly. \\n   (5) Associated Heats.  Associated heat s must be identified and investigated for \\npotentially similar defects as appropriate.    \\n \\nPeter A.

PURPOSE. This advisory circular (AC) provides information and guidance on acceptable \\nmethods, but not the only methods of compliance with § 33.4 of the Federal Aviation \\nRegulations, Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations. This section (§ 33.4) contains \\nrequirements for preparing Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (ICA’s) for aircraft \\nengines. Although this AC does refer to regulatory requirements that are mandatory, this AC is not, in itself, mandatory. This AC neither changes any regulatory requirements nor \\nauthorizes changes in or deviations from the regulatory requirements. \\n2.

In 1994, the FAA established a team comprised of engineers from the Aircraft \\nCertification Service and airworthiness inspectors from the Aircraft Maintenance Division of \\nthe Flight Standards Service. The team was tasked to provide guidance to assist with the \\ncompliance requirements of §§ 21.50, 23.1529, 25.1529, 27.1529, 29.1529, 31.82, 33.4 \\nand 35.4, and the Appendices of parts 23, 25, 27, 29, 33 and 35. This AC is an outgrowth of that team effort to provide the guidance on the preparation of ICA’s. \\nb. This AC provides information and guidance to applicants for aircraft engine design \\napprovals that may be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of \\n§§ 33.4 and Appendix A to part 33, and 21.50(b) on the preparation of ICA’s. \\n4. DISCUSSION. \\na. The applicant for an aircraft engine type certificate must prepare ICA’s as part of that \\naircraft engine’s type certification process. The ICA’s would provide information for proper \\nmaintenance that would ensure engines of that type design in an ongoing state of eligibility for installation on aircraft. Holders of aircraft engine type certificates use the Airworthiness \\nApproval Tag (FAA Form 8130-3) to document that eligibility at the time of initial production. A new aircraft engine with an airworthiness approval tag is viewed as \"airworthy\", and \\nadherence to the ICA’s will play a key role in keeping that engine airworthy through its \\noperational life, or in a state of \"continued airworthiness.\" \\nb. The term \"airworthy\" has no specific statutory or regulatory definition. In order to use an \\nAirworthiness Approval Tag on a new aircraft engine, however, the holder of the type \\ncertificate must first establish that the engine conforms to its type certificate, and is in a \\ncondition for safe operation. This two-part test constitutes a practical definition of \\n\"airworthiness\", and is consistent with the test applied to the initial issuance \\nof an aircraft’s standard airworthiness certificate, and in the context of adjudication of the question of aircraft airworthiness. Therefore, for the purpose of this AC, an aircraft engine is \\nconsidered \"airworthy\" when the following two conditions are met: \\n(1) The engine conforms to its type certificate. An engine conforms to its type certificate \\nwhen the engine configuration is consistent with the type design and other data that is part of the type certificate, as well as other approved data such as these data related to repairs, \\nmodifications or alterations. \\n(2) The engine is in a condition for safe operation. An engine is in a condition for safe \\noperation when the condition of the engine considering factors such as wear, damage, and deterioration does not prevent the engine from demonstrating compliance with those \\nrequirements of part 33 that relate to the safe operation of the engine, and does not result \\nin an unsafe condition to the aircraft. This means, for example, that a turbine engine in a \\ncondition for safe operation could still comply with the safety analysis required by § 33.75. \\nThe contents of this AC is arranged in three sections corresponding to the regulations in §§ \\n21.50(b), 33.4, and Appendix\\n A to part 33.\\n SECTION 1\\n INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS AND MANUFACTURER’S MAINTENANCE MANUALS HAVING AN AIRWORTHINESS LIMITATIONS SECTION (§ 21.50(b)) \\n5. GUIDANCE FOR § 21.50(b). \\na. General. Section 21.50(b) requires that the holder of a design approval for an aircraft \\nengine for which application was made after January 28, 1981, shall furnish at least one set of complete ICA’s to the owner of each type of aircraft engine upon its delivery, or upon \\nissuance of the first standard airworthiness certificate for the affected aircraft, whichever \\noccurs later, and thereafter make the ICA’s available to any other person required to \\ncomply with any of the terms of those instructions. \\nb. Aircraft Maintenance Manuals. It is acceptable for the engine TC holder to furnish to the \\naircraft manufacturer for incorporation into the aircraft maintenance manual, the instructions \\nthat deal with maintenance of the engine installed on an aircraft. If this method is used \\nhowever, the engine TC holder remains responsible for controlling the content and \\ndistribution of the engine section of the aircraft ICA’s. The engine TC holder should establish a program, acceptable by the FAA, to control and distribute those sections of the \\naircraft ICA’s that are used to show compliance with the engine TC requirements, including \\nany component manuals. In this context, it should be clear that the aircraft manufacturer must adopt the engine TC holder’s maintenance instructions, and should not alter those \\ninstructions. Also, only the engine TC holder may make changes to the engine maintenance portion of the aircraft ICA’s, and the aircraft manufacturer should accurately \\nincorporate those changes. In the event the engine TC holder does not or can not provide a program to control the content and distribution of the engine maintenance section of the \\naircraft ICA’s, then the engine TC holder should produce and distribute its own engine \\nICA’s. In either instance, the engine \"overhaul\" manual should always be provided \\nseparately by the engine TC holder, since it deals with maintenance of the uninstalled \\nengines.\\n c. STC’s and PMA’s, Repairs and Alternations. ICA’s are also necessary for supplemental \\ntype certificates (STC’s),  part manufacturer approvals (PMA’s), design changes, and any \\nrepairs or alterations that introduce new features that the existing ICA’s do not adequately \\ncover. In such instances, it is the responsibility of the STC or PMA holder, or the individual \\nwho receives the repair or alteration approval, to produce the required ICA’s. The process \\nof reviewing and acceptance of ICA’s for STC’s, PMA’s, design changes, and repairs or \\nalterations will be the same as that described in section 6.b. of this AC for type \\ncertifications. To assess the safety of such changes for type certification basis, the required \\nICA’s should be in accordance with the current regulatory amendment. In cases where it is \\ndetermined that the existing ICA’s are adequate for the continued airworthiness of the \\naltered product, then that determination should be noted in the design change approval \\nto ensure the continued airworthiness of the product, for example in the \"limitations and \\nconditions\" section of STC certificate.\\n SECTION 2\\n INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS UNDER § 33.4 \\n6. GUIDANCE FOR § 33.4, INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS. \\na. In the context of a certification program under part 33, the ICA’s prepared by the \\napplicant should be submitted to the FAA for acceptance before the issuance of the \\nengine TC. The ICA’s may be incomplete at the time of type certification if a program exists \\nto ensure their completion prior to delivery of the first aircraft with the engine installed, or upon issuance of a standard airworthiness certificate for the aircraft with the engine \\ninstalled, whichever occurs later. The rule accommodates applicants who could not \\ncomplete the ICA’s until a specific aircraft application is identified. However, every effort should be made to complete the ICA’s at the time of engine TC issuance. For airworthiness \\ncertification, it is not acceptable for the FAA to issue the certificate of airworthiness for an \\naircraft without complete ICA’s. However, the availability of overhaul section, or manual \\nportion of the ICA’s for overhaul or other forms of heavy maintenance may be delayed until \\nafter the engine has entered service. In such cases, the applicant should provide a schedule that is acceptable to the FAA to complete the overhaul manual or section, \\nnormally within six months after the engine entering service. Meanwhile, no person, \\nincluding the engine manufacturer, should be allowed to overhaul or perform any form of \\nheavy maintenance without an overhaul or heavy maintenance manual; and the manual, \\nwhen completed, becomes part of the ICA’s. The engine TCDS should incorporate a note prohibiting the overhaul or other form of heavy maintenance of engines until the overhaul \\nmanual is available. \\nb. Applicants should submit ICA’s for acceptance to the Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) \\nresponsible for overseeing that type certification project. That same ACO will approve any \\nairworthiness limitations and associated maintenance procedures. The Aircraft Evaluation \\nGroup (AEG) will review the ICA’s and make recommendations on the maintenance and operational aspects of the ICA’s. The ACO and AEG offices are jointly responsible for \\ndetermining the acceptability of the ICA’s, however, the final acceptance of the completed \\nICA’s is the responsibility of the ACO. \\nc. If the engine ICA’s are not completed prior to the time the engine TC is issued, \\napplicants should include as part of the plan for completion, a process for keeping the ACO \\nresponsible for certifying the aircraft informed of the status and acceptance of the engine \\nICA’s. Only with the ICA’s completed, may the FAA issue a certificate of airworthiness on \\nthe aircraft. If an engine TC is issued before the ICA’s are completed, a statement should \\nbe placed on the engine TCDS, stating that the engine ICA’s are not completed and any \\naircraft with that engine installed is not eligible for airworthiness certification until the engine ICA’s are completed and accepted by the FAA office certificating the engine.\\n SECTION 3\\n APPENDIX A TO PART 33 \\n7. GUIDANCE FOR A33.1 - GENERAL. \\na. The ICA’s should include instructions for all engine parts. The instructions should provide \\nfor the continued airworthiness of the entire engine to the extent that the lack of specific \\ninstructions for any given part should not adversely affect an operator’s ability to maintain \\nthe engine in an airworthy condition. \\nb. The determination of need for instructions regarding parts, subassemblies, assemblies or \\nmodules should include consideration of airworthiness limitations, safety assessments, \\nclassification of parts, and compliance requirements. Each part needs to be addressed \\neither individually or as part of a group or system. \\nc. Specific inspections with \"threshold\" or \"opportunity\" schedule requirements should be \\nclearly established in the ICA’s. Additionally, when the engine is in the shop and the engine \\nparts and components are exposed, the parts and components should be subjected to appropriate inspections to determine their eligibility for reinstallation in an engine for \\ncontinued service. An adequate inspection program or opportunity inspections, is essential for the continued airworthiness of the engine. \\nd. The applicant should provide in the ICA’s, a means to ensure accurate configuration \\ncontrol that complies with the type certificate for all parts, components, and any \\ncombinations of parts or components, allowing the engine configuration to be properly \\nidentified during assembly or replacement. \\ne. For highly complex engine parts and components, the ICA’s may be furnished by the \\nmanufacturers of those parts or components through the engine TC holder. However, if this \\nis done, the engine TC holder’s ICA’s should clearly cross-reference the part or component \\nmanufacturer’s instructions in the ICA’s by revision level and date of publication, since those instructions become part of the complete ICA’s as required by  § 33.4, and should \\nalso be furnished to the owners or operators under § 21.50(b). \\nf. To comply with § 33.4, the engine TC holder should have a program for controlling the \\ncontent and distribution of all engine ICA’s, including part or component manuals or \\nsections. The procedure for how to distribute the changes to the ICA’s should  be documented in the applicant’s internal procedures manual. The program for managing changes to the ICA’s is not required to be included in the ICA’s that are distributed to \\nowners and operators, but the revision history records, including revision number or level, affected pages or sections, and dates, should be included in the ICA’s. These revision \\nhistory records are important to establish the content of the \"current manual,\" required to be used under part 43. \\n8. GUIDANCE FOR A33.2 - FORMAT. \\na. The ICA’s should be organized and cross-referenced in a clear, logical and usable \\nfashion. Service Bulletins (SB’s), as described in AC 20-114, form a different class of \\nservice document than those required for type certification, and it is not recommended as a \\nsubstitute for acceptable ICA’s. Service Bulletins may be used as a vehicle for \\ndisseminating information, although the use of a temporary manual revisions is more appropriate for this purpose. It is not considered an undue burden to the TC holder to \\nincorporate the appropriate information directly into the manuals using temporary manual \\nrevisions instead of using SB’s. However, should the applicant desire to use SB’s for \\nincorporation by reference into the ICA’s, the following criteria should be as follows: \\n(1) The SB referenced in the ICA’s should be version specific. The use of a future revision note such as \"the latest \\nrevision\" is not acceptable. \\n(2) The technical content of the SB should be FAA approved. (3) The SB should be distributed to the all owners of the engine as provided in § 21.50(b). b. As noted in § A33.4, Airworthiness Limitations, there should be a \"principal manual\" in \\nthe ICA’s when there are \\nmultiple volumes. To provide for \"practical arrangement,\" that principal manual should also \\ninclude a description of the break down and application of the manuals or sections, including a table of contents listing all of the other manuals or sections that constitute the \\ncomplete ICA’s under § 33.4. \\nc. The FAA has accepted a variety of formats including the Air Transport Association (ATA) \\n100 Specification. The documents that constitute the complete ICA’s need to be clearly \\nidentified as containing the ICA’s required under § 33.4, regardless of format used. \\n9. GUIDANCE FOR A33.3 - CONTENT. It should be noted that the ICA’s are intended to \\nbe a complete document, therefore it should be emphasized that the \"information\" must be \\ncontained in the manuals or sections, and should not be in unreferenced documents, such \\nas service letters. ICA’s must be prepared using the English language, but, metric system \\nunits may be used for the technical aspects of the product in the areas of design, \\nproduction, operation, or maintenance. \\na. Guidance for A33.3(a) Engine Maintenance Manual or Section. (1) A33.3(a)(1) and(a)(2). The description of the engine features and data, its components, \\nsystems, and installations should contain sufficient details to the extent necessary to perform engine maintenance. This may include any necessary warnings, cautions and \\nguidance, such as applicable metric system or U.S. Standard System requirements. This is \\nnecessary to meet the regulatory requirements relating to the performance of maintenance \\nfor recording and surveillance of the actual work performed, and the methods, techniques \\nand practices employed. \\n(2) A33.3(a)(3). The instructions should also address all accessories, cover-plates, etc., \\nthat may be attached to, mounted on, or driven by the engine, since their interfaces affect \\nthe engine. Complete installation instructions are required for those parts and accessories \\nthat are a part of the engine type design. Minimum interface instructions and any appropriate specifications, warnings, or cautions should be provided for those areas where \\nnon-engine TC accessories or parts could be installed on the engine at a later date. \\n(3) A33.3(a)(4). The ICA’s should provide adequate information in engine control and \\noperations described in this paragraph to the extent necessary to perform the maintenance at the levels specified in the ICA’s. \\n(4) A33.3(a)(5). The servicing information includes both engine type design parts, and \\nsystems or components that are not part of the engine TC, but are installed integrally with \\nor dependent upon the engine. For example, shared oil systems with accessories or propellers, gear drive interfacing with the engine. In these instances, it is important to \\ncoordinate with the ACO that is responsible for the engine installation and the acceptance \\nof the servicing information. \\n(5) A33.3(a)(6). \\n(a) Scheduling information need not be provided for \"every part\", but rather the scheduling \\ninformation should provide for the continued airworthiness of the entire engine to the extent that the lack of specific scheduling information on any part will not adversely affect the \\ncontinued airworthiness of the engine. The substantiation for scheduling information may \\nbe derived from engine certification testing, development testing, service experience of the \\nsame or similar type design engine, or a combination thereof. The ICA’s should state that \\nthose parts not scheduled need not be serviced other than to be inspected when exposed. \\n(b) A single top level \"overhaul\" time between overhaul (TBO) for the engine could be \\nsufficient when it provides an appropriate interval to ensure the continued airworthiness of \\nthe entire engine. \\n(c) An applicant should provide one or several scheduling options for the ICA’s. The engine \\nparts, components and accessories should be monitored and serviced while installed, \\notherwise the products should be scheduled for appropriate maintenance or overhaul to \\nensure their continued airworthiness. For example, this could mean \"soft times\" for each \\nmodule, assembly, sub-assembly, accessory, or part of the engine. If the engine is taken off aircraft, then the ICA’s should provide maintenance or overhaul instructions that are \\nnecessary to determine their eligibility for reinstallation in an engine and continued service \\nuse. This could also mean that the disassembly of the engine, module or component \\nassembly to the piece part level may be required before returning the engine to service if \\nthe exposure occurs after a considerable number of hours or cycles in service. Refer to paragraphs in Section 9b for more information. \\n(d) The applicant may refer to a component manufacturer as the source for the scheduling \\ninformation. However, in that case the manufacturer’s component manual is part of the \\nICA’s and the TC holder remains responsible, even though the information contained in the component manual originates with the component manufacturer. It is the responsibility of \\nTC holder to provide the scheduling information in the principal ICA’s (e.g., engine \\nmaintenance manual), defining when the maintenance referenced in the component manual should be performed. There may be instances where only the original equipment \\nmanufacturer (OEM) is approved to work on a part or component due to the complexity of the maintenance task. In such instance, when approved by the cognizant ACO, only the \\nrecommended scheduling periods and the manufacturer’s name and address would be \\nreferenced in the ICA’s. \\n(e) The ICA’s should clearly identify and reference any component manuals that are part of the ICA’s. In such cases, the TC holder remains responsible to control the content and \\nchanges in component manuals in accordance with the program provided to the FAA under section A33.1(c) of the Appendix to part 33. The TC holder may work in conjunction \\nwith the component manufacturer to distribute changes to component manuals. \\n(f) The TC holder should clearly define what level or amount of inspection and repair or \\nreplacement of parts constitutes an \"overhaul\". This is critical for several reasons. Section \\n33.19 requires that an engine be designed and constructed to minimize the development of \\nan unsafe condition between overhaul periods, which includes components and \\naccessories that are part of the type certificate. Further, for the issuance of an export airworthiness approval on a \"newly overhauled\" product defined under § 21.321(b)(4), it is \\nnecessary to know what work constitutes a complete overhaul of the product in order to \\nmake the correct airworthiness determination for export. Section 43.2 describes in general terms what constitutes overhaul, but the ICA’s should detail what work on the particular \\nengine type meets that definition. The recommended overhaul periods should be included \\nin the ICA’s, and the necessary cross-references would typically not be in the airworthiness \\nlimitations section, unless it was necessary to prevent a failure or malfunction that could directly lead to an unsafe or hazardous condition. \\n(g) The applicant must include an inspection program in the ICA’s necessary to provide the \\ncontinued airworthiness of the engine. The initial maintenance inspection requirements, \\nderived from § 33.90 testing, in conjunction with other certification tests, analyses, and \\nservice experience, if available, are typically used to develop the inspection program for parts, subassemblies, assemblies or modules. The program need not be defined in the \\nairworthiness limitations section. However, such recommendations should cross-reference \\nany airworthiness limitations that are required to be accomplished in conjunction with the \\ninspection program. The development of an adequate inspection program should also \\ninclude subsequent inspections (periods, frequency, and parts involved) and, when applicable, the procedures for increasing inspection periods, such as a sampling program \\nor service experience of the same or similar type design engine. For systems, it is \\nnecessary to include an assessment of the entire system which may require joint engine, \\naircraft, or propeller systems review and coordination with the engine installing ACO. \\n(6) A33.3(a)(7). The troubleshooting information should assure that the engine and its \\nmodules, assemblies, sub-assemblies and parts perform their intended functions within the \\napproved flight envelope and prevent engine malfunctions. The probable malfunctions that \\ncould occur should be addressed either to rectify them or replace the affected part or \\ncomponent before continued operation. \\n(7) A33.3(a)(8). The applicant should provide in the ICA’s a means to ensure configuration \\ncontrol such that the proper parts, components, and any combinations are identified and \\ncomply with the type certificate. \\n(8) A33.3(a)(9). The list of tools should be adequate enough to complete the work. The list \\nmay consist of several lists located in the appropriate sections of the ICA’s where the work \\nis described. It is recommended however, that the list of tools and equipment be centrally located in the front of the manual or section, to better facilitate locating and ordering tools and equipment. Also, the list should include a cross-reference to the appropriate section \\nwhere directions to the method of using each tool is located. Special tools should be \\nhighlighted, since there is a specific regulatory requirement for the use of a special tool \\nwhen performing maintenance. \\nb. A33.3(b). Engine Overhaul Manual or Section. \\nIt is not necessary to define a single overhaul time for the entire engine, or even modules or \\nassemblies. However, the experience has shown that every part of the engine is exposed \\nfor inspection at some point during the life of the engine. \\nThe TC holder should clearly define what level or amount of inspection and repair or \\nreplacement of parts constitutes an \"overhaul\". Utilizing the modular maintenance concept is a method of achieving this overhaul in an efficient manner, though each part may \\neffectively be overhauled at different times or cycles. The recommended overhaul periods \\nshould be included in the ICA’s, and the necessary cross-references would typically not \\nappear in the airworthiness limitations section, unless it was necessary to prevent a failure or malfunction that could directly lead to an unsafe or hazardous condition. \\nSpecific inspections with \"threshold\" or \"window\" schedule requirements should be \\nestablished in the ICA’s. The \"window\" schedule, for example, may be established to \\ncoincide with a life limited component removal. Additionally, when an engine is in the shop \\nand areas of the engine are exposed on an opportunity basis, parts and components of those areas should be subjected to appropriate inspections to determine the eligibility of a \\npart or assembly for reinstallation and continued service use. \\n(1) A33.3(b)(1). The engine overhaul manual or section should contain sufficient details to \\nthe extent necessary for disassembly, overhaul and reassembly to be performed. This also includes any necessary warnings, cautions, and guidance. \\n(2) A33.3(b)(2): \\n(a) The determination of adequate inspection criteria should provide for appropriate \\ninspection of each part of the engine, subassembly, assembly, and module as well as systems and components. Inspections should identify the required action at each level, \\nsuch as part replacement, repair, or further detailed inspection. \\n(b) The accuracy and reliability of inspection techniques need to be consistent with the \\ncriticality of the parts being inspected, and the types of defects for which the inspection is being conducted. During inspections, when special emphasis or a higher awareness is \\nneeded, the ICA’s should clearly identify those critical parts and key features or areas. The \\ncleaning could have a significant effect on inspectability, since improper cleaning can result \\nin missed inspection of potentially hazardous defects. Therefore, the proper cleaning methods should be emphasized with the appropriate cautions where improper cleaning could be a factor. \\n(3) A33.3(b)(3). The overhaul manual should contain details for all fits and clearances \\nrelevant to the engine and components, structural integrity, and functionality a for new and \\nworn parts. While these fits and clearances may be identified in the manual as \"limits,\" they are not considered \"airworthiness limitations\". However, these limits, if exceeded, may \\nmean that the component or part is not airworthy. Therefore, such limits need to be \\nanalyzed and adjusted accordingly. \\n(4) A33.3(b)(4): \\n(a) The main objective of this requirement is that worn or substandard parts that do not \\nmeet the ICA’s inspection limits can not be returned to service. Such parts should be either \\nreplaced or repaired in order to make the engine airworthy. While the ICA’s need not \\ncontain repairs for all engine parts, the ICA’s should identify when or under what conditions \\nparts must be replaced or repaired. If a part or component fails to meet the requirements in the Inspection/Check section of the ICA’s, replacement is an acceptable alternative to \\nrepair in order to maintain the continued airworthiness of the engine. \\n(b) Repairs in the ICA’s should be complete, and may include personnel training \\nrequirements, but should not contain provisions driven solely by economic concerns. When \\nthe repair is accomplished in accordance with the ICA’s, the result is a part that conforms to \\nthe approved type design data, and if it is safe for operation would constitute an airworthy part. \\n(c) The FAA may allow, and approve of other repair data that is not part of the TC and is \\nnot reflected in the ICA’s. However, when design change data for repair or alteration constitutes a substantial change to the type design, and therefore could be considered \\nmajor, the need for information in the ICA’s for such a repair or alternation should be \\nevaluated, since any repair or alteration could introduce a new feature that does not exist in \\nthe original type design. This is particularly true for an STC. Any major design change data, \\nwhether in support of a repair or alteration, which is substantive enough to require significant additions to the ICA’s, should be approved as an STC or amended TC. \\n(5) A33.3(b)(5). The ICA’s should also contain a means to ensure configuration control \\nsuch that the proper parts, components, and any combinations that comply with the type \\ndesign, are identified during assembly or replacement. \\n(6) A33.3(b)(6): (a) The ICA’s should contain test acceptance criteria that are identified as \"limits,\" even \\nthough not \"airworthiness limitations.\" However, changes to such engine test acceptance criteria that is safety related should be considered major design changes and, may be \\nchanged with appropriate FAA approved data to substantiate the change. \\n(b) The manual or section should include instructions for testing an engine after overhaul. \\nThis should also include any minimum testing requirements for a single overhauled component or model when applicable. \\n(7) A33.3(b)(7). Any special containers, equipment and tools that may be necessary to \\ncomply with the instructions for storage should be included. The storage limits should also \\ninclude any environmental restrictions, such as limits for temperature, humidity, etc. \\n(8) A33.3(b)(8). The list of tools should be adequate to complete the work. The list may \\nconsist of several lists located in the appropriate sections of the ICA’s where the work is \\ndescribed. It is recommend however, that the list of tools \\nnecessary for overhaul is centrally located in the front of the manual to facilitate locating and ordering them. Also, the list should include a cross-reference to the appropriate section \\nwhere the directions to the method of using each tool is located or where the tools are \\nutilized. Special tools should be highlighted, since there is a specific regulatory requirement for the use of a special tool when performing maintenance. \\n10. GUIDANCE FOR A33.4 - AIRWORTHINESS LIMITATIONS SECTION. \\na. Sections 43.16 and 91.403 provide that the requirements stated in an airworthiness \\nlimitations section (ALS) must be complied with, however, \"inspection intervals\" and \\n\"maintenance actions\" required by an ALS may be adjusted or changed under an FAA \\napproved alternative program. \"Airworthiness limitation mandatory replacement times,\" \\nhowever, may not be changed without FAA engineering approval. The ALS should include only information that is approved, by the cognizant FAA certificating office. \\nb. The ALS should appear in the \"Principal Manual.\" If the ICA’s consist of an engine \\nmaintenance manual and an engine overhaul manual, the principal manual should be the engine maintenance manual. Although the owners must receive all manuals in accordance under § 21.50(b), they may only be concerned with the day to day maintenance instruction \\ncontained in the engine maintenance manual. The ALS may appear in both manuals, which \\nis acceptable as long as both ALS are identical and revised concurrently. The ALS should \\nbe prominently located, should be entitled \"The Airworthiness Limitation Section\" and \\nshould be identified as having been \"FAA Approved\" at the beginning of the section or on the cover page of the section. \\n/s/ \\nJay J.

Advances in electronic c ontrol technology associated with  flight critical system s and \\nuse of poorly conducting com posite m aterials in airc raft structure have increased concern for the \\nvulnerability of these system s to exposure to HIRF and lightning environm ents.  The lack of \\nspecific inform ation on the effects of in-servi ce environm ental factor s such as corro sion, \\nmechanical vibration, therm al cycling, m echanical dam age and repair, and m odification on the \\nassociated protection features of  the type design has also increa sed concern.  The guidance in  \\nAC 20-136 em phasizes the need to develop m aintenance requirem ents for aircraft lightning and \\nHIRF protection features.  Also, the FAA revised the Ai rworthiness Inspectors Handbook \\n8300.10 in Change 14 to ensure th at the insp ection/m aintenance plan for each operato r assures \\nthat the HIRF and lightning protec tion features of  the type design are m aintained in an airworthy \\ncondition.   \\n \\n b. The FAA ha s an on-going initiative to ensure that the ICA include appropriate \\ninspection/m aintenance functions for engine components that rely on these activities for \\ncontinued airworthiness.  This in itiative and an earlier Flight Standards bulletin have revealed \\n2 \\n9/16/05     AC 33.4-3  \\nthat the continued airworthiness of HIRF  and lightning protecti on features depend on \\nmaintenance activities.  The Airworthiness Inspectors Handbook 8300.10 relies heavily on the \\nidentificatio n of critical system s, the protection f eatures em ployed in their designs, and the ICA \\nregard ing th e inspec tion, maintena nce, and possible replacem ent of all of those features.  The \\nappropriate place for th ese reco mmendations is in the ICA (s pecifically, the m aintenance, \\noverhaul and com ponent m aintenance m anuals).  Operators m ay use the ICA, which includes the \\nInspection P rogram , whe n establishing and implem enting their FAA approved Continuous \\nAirworthine ss Main tenance Program s or other FAA approved inspection/m aintenance program s.   \\n \\n c. Although there have not been any inspect ion/m aintenance functions that specifically \\naddress the HIRF and lightning prot ection features of these flight critical engine system s for the \\nFAA to review, existing overall e ngine inspection/m aintenance functi ons are in p lace that en sure \\nthe in tegrity of  the HIRF and ligh tning protection features .  These general \\ninspection/m aintenance functions have been e ffectiv e in m aintaining th e HIRF and lightning \\nprotection features in designs th at are currently used by industry.  This is dem onstrated by the \\n430 m illion hours (th rough the firs t quarter of 2004)  of in-service experience on engin es with \\nElectronic E ngine Control (EEC) system s that  have not had any known HIRF and lightning \\ninciden ts attributed to in -serv ice env ironm ental degradation effects.  There have not been any \\nengine problem s attributed to the lack of inspection and m aintenance of HIRF and lightning \\nprotection features.  How ever, in-service survei llance of airplane HIRF and lightning protection \\nfeatures indicates that ex isting airpla ne inspec tion/maintenan ce functions do not detect som e \\nprotection degradation.  In additi on, researchers at W ichita State Un iversity have confirm ed that \\nwithout inspection/m aintenance som e HIRF and lightning protective features m ay degrade. The \\nFAA Technical Center issued a technical re port (DOT/FAA/AR-04/14) in October 2004 about \\nthis research  (see th e reference in  paragraph 4d of this AC).   \\n \\n d. FAA and industry com mittees have developed g uidance for inspection/mainten ance o f \\naircraft lightning and HIRF pr otection features.  AC 20-136 S ection 7 recommends that the \\ncertification applicant develop m aintenance re quirem ents for aircraft lightning protection \\nfeatures.  S AE ARP5415 Section 8 provides ad dition al details and gu idelines f or ligh tning \\nprotec tion m ainten ance.  SAE ARP5583 Section 9  provides ad dition al details and gu idelines f or \\nHIRF protection m aintenance.  In 1999, we publishe d internal guidance that  called for review of \\napplicants’ m aintenance requirem ents for aircraft HIRF protection. \\n \\n e. The following are exam ples of current inspection/m aintenance functions that have \\nplayed a role in providin g good service experience:   \\n \\n  (1)  Inspection and associated pro cedures linked to troubleshooting and Line \\nReplaceab le Unit rem ovals;  \\n \\n  (2)  Fault detection or annun ciation of el ectrical system  faults through Built-In-Test;  \\n \\n  (3)  General Vis ual Inspe ction associa ted with scheduled aircraft Zonal Inspection \\nProgram s; and  \\n \\n3 \\nAC 33.4-3    9/16/05 \\n  (4)  Normally scheduled engine shop visits and specific com ponent shop m aintenance \\nassociated w ith periodic m aintenance, alterati on, or upgrade, soft-tim e component inspection, or \\nmaintenance and repair, when applicable.   \\n \\n f. However, typical inspection/m aintenance on aircraft and engines has not always been \\nadequate to ensure the continued airworthine ss of HIRF and l ightning protection fe atures.  \\nDepending upon the complexity of the protection design used, m ore specific and validated \\ninspection/m aintenance functions may be necessary  to ensu re the con tinued airworthiness of \\nprotection features in service.   \\n \\n g. Although there have been no known HIRF a nd lightning incidents attributed to in-\\nservice engine environm ental degradation effects,  there is one known case of an engine flam eout \\nattributed to lightning for which an airworthin ess directive (AD) was issued.  Investigation \\nrevealed that the engine flam eout oc curred beca use sever al shields f or the cable h arness of  the \\nEEC were no longer properly grounded to the airf rame.  Thi s condition, if not corrected, could \\nresult in insufficient protection of the EEC.  The servic e bulletin a ssociated with the AD \\ndescribes procedures for a visual  inspection to verify the integr ity of the shield grounds for the \\ncable harness of the EEC and to correct any di screpancy.  The service bulletin also describes \\nprocedures to m easure the electr ical resistance of certain shield  grounds, and to repair them , if \\nnecessary.  The repair procedures ensure that  the metal overb raid (w hich provides lightning \\nprotection f or the EEC cable harn ess) is electrically bonded to the connector, and that the \\nelectrical receptacles are elec trically bonded to the airfram e.  This incident em phasizes the \\nimportance of m aintaining the continued airw orthiness of HIRF and lightning protection \\nfeatures.  \\n \\n6. GENERAL.   \\n \\n a. The engine TC, STC or ATC applicant de veloping ICA for aircraft engine HIRF and \\nlightning protection should identify the approp riate eng ine system s and equipm ent, their \\nassociated w iring, and all the pr otection features used by the t ype design to m eet the engine \\nHIRF and lightning protection re quirem ents.  The engine system s and equipm ent m ay be \\nidentified using criteria in the HIRF and light ning protection guidance, such as AC 20-136, or \\nthrough functional hazard analyses or system  safety analyses.  Table 1 in Appendix 1 provides a \\nlist of potential problem  areas and vu lnerab ilities that m ay contribute to degradation of \\nprotection and that can be consider ed when developing the ICA’s.  \\n \\n b. At a m inimum, system s whose failure or  malfunc tion could prevent continued safe \\nflight and landing of the aircra ft, and for lightning, system s whose failure or m alfunction could \\nreduce the capability of the aircraft o r the ab ility of  the f light crew to cope with adverse \\noperating conditions, should be identified a nd specifically addressed during the ICA \\ndevelopm ent.  Next, the engine TC, STC or AT C applicant developing th e ICA should define the \\ninspection and test m ethod(s), ac ceptance criteria, and intervals that apply to these HIRF and \\nlightning protection features.  These HIRF a nd lightning ICA should detect degradation of \\nprotection features so that the f eatures can be repaired to their original condition.  The scope of \\nthese ICA depends on the detailed H IRF and lightni ng protection design approa ch of a particular \\nengine m odel and the criticality of  the system s being protected.  \\n4 \\n9/16/05     AC 33.4-3  \\n \\n c. Of special n ote is that  coordination is required to a ssure com patibility be tween the \\nengine’s and  the ins taller’s ICA’s.  \\n \\n d. During the design and packaging, considera tion should be given to  the ICA activities \\nthat are to b e used.  It m ay be key to the ICA’s th at easy access to pro tection com pone nts for \\nchecks and troubleshooting is helpful.  Taking this into account in the design can be an im portant \\nfactor. \\n \\n7. ICA TAS KS—HIRF AND LIGHT NING P ROTECTION F EATURES.   \\n \\n a. Inspection and m aintenance functions for the HIRF and lightning protection features are \\nan essentia l factor in the conti nued airworthiness of th e protection features and devices.  Results \\nfrom  these ICA inspection/m aintenance functions m ay be us ed to evaluate the effectiveness of \\nprotection features of system s.   \\n \\n b. The engine and equipment HIRF and li ghtning protection feat ures are typ ically \\ndesigned to be effective over the life of the engine or equipm ent.  Laboratory environm ental tests \\nfor vibration, hum idity, tem perature, and salt exposure are often conducted on protection \\nelem ents and equipm ent, and previous service e xperience on other aircraft engine models or \\nconfigurations is typica lly considered when designing these features.   \\n \\n c. In addition, although findings from  certain inspection/m aintena nce actions m ay not \\ndirectly indicate the effectiven ess of HIRF and lightning protec tion features, they m ay provide \\nindirect indications that show degradation in capability.  For ex ample, a visual inspection m ay \\ndiscover connector corrosion that  would indicate the potential for increased shield bonding \\nresistance.  But direct measurem ent must be us ed to dete rmine shie lding ef fectivenes s.   \\n \\n d. Therefore, the ICA should specify those in spection/m aintenance function s necessary to \\nprovide a h igh degree of  reliability a nd con tinue d airworth iness for HIRF and lightn ing \\nprotection features and devices.  These inspectio n/maintenance functions should be included in \\nthe inspection program  and validated.  The results  of the inspection program  should be used to \\nassess its effectiveness in contin uing the product’s com pliance with the type design in service.  \\n \\n8. TYPICAL I NSPECTION/MAINTE NANCE FU NCTION ELEMENTS.  The following are \\nsome of the common elem ents of the  protection features of inspection/ maintenance functions \\n(SAE ARP5583 Section 9 and SAE ARP5415 Sec tion 8 provide m ore details on HIRF and \\nlightning protection m aintenance m ethods): \\n \\n a. Detailed bo nding res istance m easurem ents are effective in d etermining ch anges to \\nconnector bonding resistance, pa nel bonding, or bonding jumper perf ormance.  The disadvantage \\nof this m ethod is that ad dition al testing or an alysis is required to asses s if bonding res istance \\nchanges are affecting the overall system  HIRF  and lightning protecti on.  B onding resistance on \\ncertain com ponents m ay have m ore effect on the HIRF and lightning protection than bonding \\nresistance on other com ponents.  Also, trad itional bonding resistance m easurem ents are not \\neffective for detecting w ire shie ld degradation, particularly f or com plex wire bundles with m any \\n5 \\nAC 33.4-3    9/16/05 \\nbranches and term inations.  A dvantages of bonding resistance m easure ments, however, are that \\nthey can often be taken during other aircraft/eng ine m aintenance ac tivities and do no t requ ire that \\nthe aircr aft/engine be lo cated a t a spe cific test site.   \\n \\n b. Loop resistance or im pedance m easurem ents are effective in determ ining changes to \\nwire bundle shields and connectors.  Loop measur ements are particularly good for complex wire \\nbundles.  As with bonding resistance  measure ments, additional testi ng or analysis is required to \\nassess if loop resistance or im pedance changes ha ve any real effect on the overall system HIRF \\nand lightning protection m argin.  High loop resistance on certain wire bundles m ay have m ore \\neffect on the HIRF and lightni ng protection than high loop resi stance on other wire bundles.  \\nLoop resistance or im pedance m easurem ents can often be taken during other aircraft/engine \\nmaintenance activ ities, d o not requ ire that the airc raft/eng ine b e loca ted at a specific test site, and \\ndo not generally require wire bundle disassem bly or disconnecti on.  The F AA Technical Center \\nissued a technical report (DOT /FAA/ AR-04/15) in October 2004 on research perform ed at \\nWichita State University  on this to pic.   \\n \\n c. In som e cases, an applicant m ay wish to  include lim ited tear-down inspections that m ay \\nbe part of the required inspecti on/m aintenance functions.  For exam ple, it m ay be desirable to \\ndisassem ble selected con nectors to detect corro sion or shield term ination failure that would not \\nbe visible during m aintenance inspections. \\n  \\n d. Full aircraft/engine tests specified in the ICA are one m ethod of determ ining the \\ncontinued airworthiness of HI RF and lightning protection co mponents or system s.  Full \\naircraft/eng ine tes ts include high- level RF tests,  low-level sw ept frequency tests, and low-level \\ndirect drive tests.  The results of these tests can  be directly co mpared to  the original HIRF and \\nlightning certification data.  Th is approach m ay be used to evaluate adequacy of the \\ninspection/m aintenance functions.  The disadvantage of full aircra ft/eng ine te sts is that the se \\ntests m ay not provide inform ation on the location or extent of individu al protection elem ent \\ndegradation if that degradation results in com promising the system ’s overall integrity.  For \\nexam ple, a full aircraft/engine test co uld indicate unacceptable degradatio n, but could not be \\nused to identify the cause, such as an indivi dual connector or shield  term ination.  Another \\ndisadvan tage is th at full airc raft/eng ine tes ts require highly sp ecialized  test equipm ent and \\ntraining.   \\n \\n e. Acceptance criteria shou ld be develo ped for each  specified in spection/m aintenance tas k.  \\nIf electrical bonding or loop resistan ce m easurem ents are required, m aximum  acceptable \\nelectrical resistance va lues should be specified.  These m aximum  acceptable resistance values \\nshould be based on the engine HIRF and lightning  protection certification tests or analyses.  \\n \\n f. Certain HIR F and lightning protection features m ay require  specific functional tests to \\ndeterm ine th eir con tinue d airworth iness.  For example, lightning protec tion devices such as \\ntransient suppression diodes m ay require specia lized tes t equipm ent to determ ine if  these \\nprotec tion d evices are s till functiona l. These f unctiona l tests are som etimes required f ollowing \\naircraft exposure to severe lightning or to a HIRF  environm ent that can result in failure of these \\nprotection features with out any fault indication. \\n \\n6 \\n9/16/05     AC 33.4-3  \\n g. Inspection of protection features within  the electronic engine control has been \\nacceptable at intervals when the electronic eng ine contro l has been opened  for som e other \\nreason, such as, repair of  a detected internal fa ult.  However, for this to be a valid m ethod, it \\nmust be established that this in terval is appropriate.  It is possible, though not likely, that the \\ninterval cou ld take th e unit to its end  of life (that is , if the EE C is never returned for repair).  This \\napproach depends on no introduction of comm on m ode HIRF and lightning  failures, c ommon to \\nmore than one engine, that would invalidate the original system  certification. This factor m ust be \\nshown to be valid. \\n \\n h. Appendix 1 of this docum ent provides an exam ple of the calculation of the averag e \\nsystem  failure rate for a system  where there are undetec table f ailures in s ome of the system ’s \\nlightning strike protective com ponents and those components are only repaired when the unit is \\nundergoing repair for failures of components that are detectable. \\n \\n9. VALIDATION OF INS PECTION/ MAINTENANCE FUNCTIONS AND \\nDETERMI NATION OF THEIR EFFECTIVENESS.   \\n \\n a. The extent o f validation activ ity depends on the scope of the engine \\ninspection/m aintenance tasks specific to HIRF and lightning protection.  If the results from  \\ninspection/m aintenance tasks do not provide inform ation to determ ine th e effectiven ess of  the \\nHIRF and lightning protection features, then va lidation is necessary.  For exam ple, visual \\ninspec tion m ay be used to dete rmine the con tinued airworthiness of th e wire shielding or \\nraceways; h owever, validation tasks should be sp ecified to in clude direct m easure ments of \\nappropriate protection features to sho w accep table capability.   SAE ARP5583 Section 9.4 and \\nSAE ARP5415 Section 8.4 provide m ore detail s on HIRF and lightning protection assurance \\napproaches that m ay be used to validat e the inspe ction/maintenance f unctions.  \\n \\n b. If the inspe ction/m ainten ance ta sks p rovide a direct m easurement of the protection \\nelem ents, th en valid ation may not be required for these elem ents.  W hen an engine T C, STC or \\nATC applicant has determ ined that validation is  not required, the appl icant should docum ent the \\nrationale f or this de termination and p resent it to  the FAA for concurrence.  For exam ple, the \\napplicant may have relevant opera ting experien ce gained in the pa st with  the sam e or sim ilar \\ninstallations.  If the effect of this design expe rience has already been in cluded in the applic ant’s \\ndesign, th e applican t may show that a valid ation activ ity is n ot necessary . \\n  \\n c. The validation activity typically uses a sa mple of in-service engi nes.  When selecting \\nengines for the sam ple, the applicant should:  \\n \\n  (1)  Focus on high operating tim e and high flight cycle aircraft.   \\n  \\n  (2)  Consider the operating environm ent fo r the selected engin es, such as extrem e \\ntemperatures, corrosive environm ents like sa lt spray, or other harsh environm ents.   \\n \\n  (3)  If applicable, consider th e engine installation conf igurations. \\n \\n7 \\nAC 33.4-3    9/16/05 \\n  (4)  Use m ore than one engine in the sampling activity.  For example, when dealing \\nwith engine models with  expected fleet sizes th at exceed 500 aircraft, an initial sam ple size of \\nfive to ten aircraft and their as sociated engines is  considered adequate.   \\n \\n d. During norm al engine m aintenance actions, the HIRF and lightning protection features \\nmay be affe cted, which m ay affect the validatio n activity.  F or exam ple, during an engine shop \\nvisit f or maintenance it m ay be determ ined that  a harness should be re placed.  Replacing the \\nharness p rior to va lidation, however, would alter the data for es tablishing the dete rioration of the \\nshielding effectiveness of the harness with tim e.  The validat ion activities in  the ICA should \\nconsider how to account for engine m aintenance actions that m ay affect the HIRF and lightning \\nprotection features.   \\n \\n e. Sampling ac tivitie s are n ormally sche duled as close to the beginning of heavy \\nmaintenance activities as possibl e to ensure an evaluation of in-service conditions.  S ampling, \\nwhich can be scheduled along with the heavy m aintenance activities, typi cally requires suitable \\nengine acces sibility to gain acce ss to HIRF and lightning pro tection features.  Sam pling activ ities \\nscheduled every four to five  years fo r the selected airc raft/en gine are adequate.   \\n \\n f. The engine TC, STC or ATC applicant may set up a separate inspection/m aintenance \\nvalida tion a ctivity for individua l engine system s, electrical eq uipm ent, or electronic engine \\ncontrols for HIRF and lightning protection features located w ithin equipment that cannot be \\neffectively verified by aircraft/engine tests or equipment in-service acceptance tes ts.   \\n \\n g. If the engine ICA do not specify tests to  determ ine functionality of HIRF a nd lightning \\nprotection com ponents, such as filters or tran sient suppression devices, based on an assum ed \\nreliability of  the pro tection com pone nts, then the validation activ ity cou ld include tes ts to \\nvalida te the assum ed reliability. This valida tion a ctivity could also be done by other m eans, such \\nas failure mode substantiation or field experience.   \\n \\n h. The validation of the inspection/m aintenance functions of the ICA should focus on \\nengine HIRF and lightning protection features associated with system s and features w hose \\nfailure or malfunction could prevent continue d safe flight and la nding of the aircraft. \\n \\n \\n \\n//Original signed by FAF on 9/16/05// \\nFran A.

AVER AGE SYS TEM FAILUR E RATE \\n \\nNote :  The f ollowing ex ample illustr ates calculation of  the av erage sys tem failure \\nrate for a sy stem  where there are und etecta ble failures in some of the system ’s \\nlightning strike protective com ponents a nd those com ponents are only repaired \\nwhen the unit is undergoing repair for fa ilures of com ponents that are detectable. \\n \\n1. The subject of using an elec tronic u nit’s m ean-tim e-between-failure (MT BF) for detectable \\nfailures as th e repa ir interval for the u nit’s und etected failures in the lightning protective \\ncomponents has been receiving increased attentio n.  This appendix presents a sim plified Markov \\nmodel analysis of a basic 2-unit system , such as  a full-authority-d igital -engine control (FADEC) \\nsystem . The exam ple shows that th e impact of sy stem  failures caused by lightning strikes is quite \\nsmall.  The results also show that using the el ectronic unit’s MTBF for de tected failures as the \\nrepair interval for undetected  failures in the lightning prot ective com ponents is adequate. \\n \\n2. Two configurations  are analyzed :   \\n \\n (a) The first con figuration is a dual chann el system  where both ch anne ls are contained in \\nthe sam e physical unit.  In this system, both channel’s lightning protective elem ents can be \\ninspected and repaired w hen the unit is opened for re pair of detected faults in either channel.   \\n \\n (b) The second configuration is when each cha nnel is contained in its own separate box.  In \\nthis case, only those lightning protective com ponents in the u nit being rep aired f or a detected \\nfault can be inspec ted an d, if faulty, repaired.  \\n \\n3. In either of the two configur ations an alyzed, the applican t must inc lude in struc tions, w ithin \\nthe unit’s C omponent Maintenance Manual, that in spection and repair of the protection devices \\nmust be carried out in accordance with thes e assu mptions.  \\n \\n4. The analysis assum es that 10 percent of  a channel’s com pone nts are for lightning \\nprotection.  This is a very conser vative, high estim ate.  It is also  assum ed that 10 percent of the \\nlightning protective components can fa il in an undetected state, also a conservative estim ate.  \\nThus, one percent of the units MTB F for detectable  failure are assum ed to result in u ndetec table \\nfailures in the lightning protective components.  It is also assum ed that the system  is approved \\nfor tim e-limited-dispatch (TLD) operation.  TLD ope ration allows the system  to be dispatched \\nwith one unit known to be inoperative for a specified  num ber of flight hours before repair of the \\nfaulty unit is required.   \\n \\n5. In both examples, the average failure rate with  respect to lig htning st rikes is added to the \\naverage ran dom com ponent system  failure rate to yield an o verall avera ge system  failure ra te.  \\nThis averag e includ es the impact of TLD operati ons.  The impact of TLD operations is shown in \\nthe followin g results.   \\n \\n1 \\nAC 33.4-3    9/16/05 \\nAppendix 1 \\n \\nAPPENDIX 1.

The Markov m odel includes the \\nfollowing conditions: \\n \\n 1. The system  can fail due to random  failures in the R com ponents.

This is show n by the σ transitions \\nfrom  the P3 and P4 states to the P LOTC state. \\n \\nThe m odel s hows the two configurations where bo th channels are in the sam e physical unit and \\nwhere the two channels  are con tained in separate units.   \\n• When both channels a re in the sam e unit:  \\no The repair rate ( µ) from the P4 sta te is to th e full-up sta te (P FU) because any \\nundetected failures in the lightning protec tive elem ents in the channel that does \\nnot have de tected f aults will be f ound and repa ired in either channel.  \\n• When each channel is in  a separate u nit: \\no The repair rate µ from  the P4 state is to the P1 state because undetected faults in \\nthe channel  that is not being repair ed (for detected fau lts) will not be found and \\nrepaired.   \\n2 \\n9/16/05     AC 33.4-3 \\n      Appendix 1 \\n3  \\nAPPENDIX 1.

PURPOSE . This advis ory circular (AC) provi\\ndes definitions, guidance, and acceptable \\nmethods, but not the only methods, that may be us ed to demonstrate compliance with the engine \\nlife-limited parts integrity requirements of § 33.70 of  Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations \\n(14 CFR part 33). Section 33.70 contains requ irements applicable to the design and life \\nmanagement of propulsion system life-limited parts including high-en ergy rotating parts. \\n2. APPLICABILITY . \\na. The guidance provided in this document is dire cted to engine manufacturers, modifiers, \\nforeign regulatory authorities,  part manufacturers who hold Pa rts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) \\nauthority, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designated engineer ing representatives. \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor regul atory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes acceptable means, but not  the only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations.  The FAA w ill consider other methods of demonstrating \\ncompliance that an applicant may elect to present.   Terms such as “should”, “shall”, “may”, and \\n“must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of \\ncompliance when the acceptable method of complia nce in this document is used.  While these \\nguidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in \\ndetermining compliance with the relevant regulations.  On the other hand, if the FAA becomes \\naware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as  the basis for finding compliance. \\nc. This material does not change, create any additional, auth orize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 02/24/17 AC 33.70-1, Chg 1 \\n3.

Approved life. The mandatory replacement life of a part that is approved by the \\nAdministrator and listed in the Airworthiness Limitation Section (ALS) of the Instructions for \\nContinued Airworthiness (ICA). \\nb. Attributes. Inherent characteris tics of a finished part that determines its capability to \\nachieve the approved li fe without failure. \\nc. Damage tolerance. An element of the lif e management process that recognizes the \\npotential existence of component  imperfections, which are the re sult of inherent material \\nstructure, material processing, component design, manufacturing or  usage.  Damage tolerance \\naddresses this situation through th e incorporation of fracture resi stant design, fracture mechanics, \\nprocess control, and non destructive inspection. \\nd. Design Target Risk (DTR). The relative risk of a failure caused by material, \\nmanufacturing or service indu ced anomalies and the standard  against which probabilistic \\nassessment results (stated in terms of component ev ent rates and/or engine level event rates) are \\n2 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\ncompared.  Since not all variables may be considered or may not be capable of being accurately \\nquantified, the numerical predictions are used on a comparative basis to evaluate various \\noptions with the same level of inputs.  Results from these analyses are typically used for design \\noptimization to meet a predefined target, or to  conduct parametric stud ies.  This type of \\nprocedure differs from an absolute risk analys is, which attempts to consider all significant \\nvariables, and is used to quan tify the predicted number of future events with safety and \\nreliability ramifications. \\ne. Engine life-limited parts. Engine rotor and major static structural parts whose primary \\nfailure is likely to result in a hazardous e ngine effect.  For the purposes of § 33.70, a hazardous \\nengine effect is any of th e conditions listed in § 33.75. \\nf. Engine flight cycle. The flight profil e or combination of profiles on which the \\napproved life is based. \\ng. Engineering plan. A plan that includes the assumptions, technical data and actions \\nrequired to establish and maintain the life cap ability of an engine life-limited part.  The \\nengineering plan is established and executed as part of the pre and post-certification activities. \\nh. Failure. Separation of the part into two or mo re pieces or into a condition so that it is \\nno longer whole or complete.  Examples of failures include disk or case bursts. \\ni. Fixed process. A manufacturing method used  to produce a part th at, once established, \\ncannot be changed without engineering approval a nd alteration of the engineering plan.  A fixed \\nprocess ensures that a part is produced by a consistent, stable and repeatable process. \\nj. Feature. A unique location, stru ctural shape, or surface of a component or part.  For a \\ndisk, a feature would be blade slot s, bore or web locations.  Other examples are grooves, slots, or \\nholes. Each unique feature is usually produced using a different  primary machining process and \\npractice. \\nk. ICA. Instructions for Continued Airworthiness as required by § 33.4. \\nl. Life limit. An operational se rvice exposure limit characteriz ed by the application of a \\nfinite number of flights or flight cycles.  For ro tating parts, it is equal to  the minimum number of \\nflight cycles required to initiate a crack e qual to approximately 0.030 inches in length by 0.015 \\ninches in depth. For life-limited pressure-loaded static parts, the life limit may be based on the \\ncrack initiation life plus a portion of  the residual crack growth life. \\nm. Life management. A series of interrela ted engineering, manuf acturing, and service \\nsupport activities that ensure that life-limited en gine parts are removed from service prior to the \\ndevelopment of a hazardous condition. \\nn. Likely to result. Given that the part has failed, regardless of the probability of \\noccurrence, what are the possible consequences  on the engine and/or aircraft?  The word \\n“possible” used in the context of this defi nition, means it can occur but does not include \\nconsequences which are so remote that th ey are, for practical purposes, impossible. \\n3 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\no. Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF). The process of progressive and permanent local structural \\ndeterioration occurring in a materi al subject to cyclic variations in stress an d strain of sufficient \\nmagnitude and number of repetitions.  The proces s will culminate in a detectable crack initiation \\ntypically within 10E+05 cycles. A detectable crack initiation is defined as 0.030 inches in length \\nby 0.015 inches in depth. \\np. Manufacturing plan. A plan that identifies the part specific manufacturing process \\nconstraints which must be included in the manufacturing definition (drawings, procedures, \\nspecifications, etc.) necessary to consistently produce each engine life-limited part with the \\nattributes required by the engineering plan. \\nq. Primary failure. Failure of a part that is not the result of prior failure  of another part or \\nsystem. \\nr. Repairable limits. Damage that can be repa ired so the part retains its current approved \\nlife limit. \\ns. Residual crack growth life. The number of cycles required for a crack of a specified \\nstarting size to grow to failure. \\nt. Safe life. A cyclic fatigue based process in which life-limited components are \\ndesigned, manufactured, substantiated, and maintained  to have a specified service life or life \\nlimit, which is stated in operating flight cy cles, operating hours, or both.  The “safe life \\napproach” requires that parts be removed from service prior to the de velopment of an unsafe \\ncondition (that is, crack initiation) .  The safe life approach only applies to parts which define \\ncrack initiation as the li mit of the useful life, such as rotating parts. \\nu. Serviceable limits. Damage that can be to lerated without impacting the approved life \\nof the part. \\nv. Service management plan. A plan that de fines the in-service ma intenance processes \\nand the limitations to repair associated with each engine life-limited part such that the part will maintain the attributes required by the engineerin g plan.  These processes and limitations become \\npart of the ICA. \\n6. INTRODUCTION. \\na. Since the failure of an engine life-limited part  is likely to result in a hazardous engine \\neffect as defined in § 33.75, applicants should m eet specific integrity requirements by executing \\na series of life management activities.  The life management requirements, as defined in § 33.70, \\nnecessitate the development and execution of an  engineering plan, a ma nufacturing plan, and a \\nservice management plan for each life-limited part .  These three plans form a closed-loop system \\nthat links the assumptions made in the engineeri ng plan, to how the part is manufactured, and to \\nhow the part is maintained in service.  E ngineering, manufacturing, and service management \\nmust function as an integrated system and rec ognize the effects of actions in one area on the \\nentire system. \\n4 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\nb. The engineering plan defines the assumptions , technical data, and actions required to \\nestablish and maintain the life cap ability of each part.  The engin eering plan is established prior \\nto the introduction of the part into service. \\nc. To produce parts with the char acteristics required by the engi neering plan, the applicant \\nshould have a consistent and repeatable manufacturing method.  The manufacturing plan \\nhighlights the parameters that are significant to at taining the life of the part and that should not \\nbe changed without verification and engineering approval.  The pa rameters generally involve the \\nmanufacturing process steps, controls, and cons traints, such as the drawings, procedures, \\nspecifications, and machining instructions requir ed to produce and inspect a part using a fixed \\nprocess to meet the design intent as defined by the engineering plan. \\nd. The service management plan ensures that the operational service assumptions and life \\ndetermined by the method in the engineering plan  remain valid.  It al so defines the part \\nlimitations associated with service maintenance, overhaul, and repair.  Th ese service limitations \\nare conveyed to the maintenance facilities thr ough the ICA.  The service management plan \\napplies a comparable level of control to the se rvice aspects of part life management as the \\nmanufacturing plan does for th e manufacturing processes. \\n7.  GENERAL. \\na. Life System Approval. \\n(1) For an applicant to use a life system, the FAA must first approve the system.  The \\napplicant should submit a formal written document to the FAA for approval that identifies the \\ntechniques and controls to be used to establish and maintain the life limits.  This document will remain on file with the FAA.  Proposed changes to  life system content must be submitted to the \\nFAA for approval. Modifications mu st be approved prior to use. \\n(2) The FAA will evaluate the applicant’s technical approach, process controls, \\nexperience, and conformance to accepted practices.  Based on this evaluation, the FAA will assign a “safety factor” which may reduce the ap proved life-limits.  Safety factors can range \\nfrom 1.0 (no life reduction) to  a substantial reduction. \\nb. Certification Process Overview. The applicant determines the safe life based on the \\napproved techniques on file with the FAA.  Th e FAA will approve, if appropriate, an approved \\nlife that may be less than the safe life.  A list of life-limited parts and the approved life for each part must be included in the ALS of the ICA as required by § 33.4.  The approved life is the \\npart’s mandatory retirement life. \\nc. Identification of Engine Life-Limited Parts. \\n(1) Engine life-limited parts are those engine rotating and ma jor static structural parts \\nwhose primary failure is likely to result in a haza rdous engine effect.  A hazardous engine effect \\nis any of the conditions listed in § 33.75. Engi ne life-limited rotating pa rts usually include, but \\nmay not be limited to, disks, spools, spacers, hubs, and shafts.  Static structural parts usually \\ninclude, but may not be limited to, high-pre ssure cases and non-redundant engine mount \\ncomponents.  To ensure a hazardous engine effect  does not occur, an operating limitation or life \\n5 \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 \\t AC 33.70-1 \\nlimit must be established for each engine life-lim ited part.  The operating limitation or life limit \\nshould specify the maximum allowable number of f light cycles when the part must be removed \\nfrom service.  Identification of engine life- limited parts per § 33.70 is focused on parts whose \\nprimary damage mechanism is controlled by low cycle fatigue. \\n(2) If a part is made of variou s sub-parts that are finally in tegrated in an inseparable \\nmanner into a unique part, and any one of the sub- parts is identified as an engine life-limited \\npart, then the entire part is treat ed as an engine life-limited part. \\nd. Attributes of a Part. Attributes include, but are not limited to: size, shape, material \\nmechanical properties, material microstructure, material anomalies, residual stress, surface \\ncondition, and geometric tolerances.  Processes su ch as alloy melting practice, ingot conversion \\nto billet or bar, forging, casting, machining, weld ing, coating, shot peen ing, finishing, assembly, \\ninspection, storage, repair, maintenance, overhau l and handling may influence the attributes of \\nthe finished part. Environmental conditions experienced in service may also affect the attributes. \\ne. Content of a Plan. The engineering, manufacturing, and service management plans \\nshould provide clear information for the management  of the engine life-limited part.  “Plan” in \\nthe context of § 33.70 does not nece ssarily mean that all the requi red technical information must \\nbe contained in a single document.  When releva nt information exists elsewhere, the plan may \\nreference, as appropriate, documents such as drawings, material spec ifications, and process \\nspecifications.  These references should be clear , uniquely identify the re ferenced document, and \\nallow the history of the individual part number to  be traced.  The referenced documents should \\nbe available for examination if re quired by the appropriate authority. \\n8. GUIDANCE FOR DEFINING AN ENGINEERING PLAN. \\na. Introduction. The engineering plan consists of a set of comprehensive life assessment \\nprocesses and technologies that ensure each engine life-limited part can be removed from service \\nbefore hazardous engine effects can occur.  Th ese processes and technologies address the design, \\ntest validation, and certification requirements.  The plan defines those manufacturing and field \\nmanagement processes and attributes that must be controlled to ensure the established life is \\nachieved and maintained during service deployment. \\nb. Elements of the Engineering Plan. The e ngineering plan should address the following \\nsubjects: \\n(1) Analytical and empirical engineering proce sses used to determine the safe life.  \\nThese processes include: \\n\\uf0b7\\t The projected or actual aircra ft flight profiles used to establish the safe life.  \\nThe safe life should reflect service usag e profiles associated with specific \\napplications and account fo r environmental factors. \\n\\uf0b7 The mechanical and aerodynamic loads that will be applied to the part. \\n\\uf0b7 Thermal and structural analyses. \\n6 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\n(2) Structured specimen, component and engine  development, and certification testing \\nto confirm the part operati ng conditions and to enhance confidence in the safe life. \\n(3) Identification of the attributes which mu st be provided during manufacture of the \\npart and maintained during service operation.  Any in-service inspections id entified as critical \\nelements to the overall part integrity should be incorporated into the service management plan. \\nc. Establishment of the Part Life. Determining the life capability of an engine life-limited \\npart involves the consideration of  many factors, each of which ma y have a significant influence \\non the final results. There can also be considerab le variation in the methods used to establish the \\nlife limits for engine parts, many of which provide  acceptable results.  Paragraphs 8.d. and 8.e of \\nthis AC outline the essential elements of a sy stem which are required to  determine satisfactory \\nlife limits. \\nd. Establishment of Safe Life for Rotating Parts. The following figure illustrates a \\nrepresentative process used to establ ish the safe life for rotating parts: \\n7 \\n\\n \\nFigure 1.

Th e engine flight cycles should \\ninclude the various flight segments  that describe a complete flight  (or flights).  For example, for \\nfixed wing aircraft applications th is may include segments such as start, idle, taxi, takeoff, climb, \\ncruise, approach, landing, thrust reverse and shutdown.  The power requirements for each flight \\nsegment are based on the power required by the airc raft application(s).  The hold times at the \\nvarious flight segments should correspond to the limiting installation vari ables (aircraft weight, \\nclimb rates, etc.).  Prior to service, the applicant should pred ict the flight profiles and the \\ncorresponding flight segments based on anticipated  operator usage, and require coordination with \\nthe aircraft manufacturer and poten tial operators.  During service, actual flight profiles may be \\nrecorded and may differ from thos e originally predicted which may alter or reduce the safe life.  \\nProfiles should be conservative and based on realistic use of full rated power.  When the engine \\nmanufacturer cannot obtain adequate knowledge of  the operation of the aircraft, especially for \\nolder aircraft, the flight profile(s) sh ould be based on conservative projections. \\n(b) The applicant should validate and maintain  the accuracy of the engine flight \\ncycle over the life of the design. The extent of the validation depends on the approach taken in \\nthe development of the engine flight cycle.  Fo r example, a conservative  flight cycle where all \\nthe variables are placed at the most life dama ging value would require minimum validation.  A \\nflight cycle that attempts to accurately represen t the actual flight profile, but is inherently less \\nconservative, would require more extensive validation.  Applicants may apply further \\nrefinements to the engine flight cycle when significant field operati onal data is obtained. \\n(c) Flight profiles are defined as the power required versus time, and serve as the \\ninput or the boundary conditions for the next step. \\n(2) Engine Performance.  For each flight c ondition or flight segment, the applicant \\nshould determine the corresponding internal performa nce parameters, i.e., rotor speeds, internal \\npressures and temperatures.  The performance parameters should be adjusted for production tolerances, control tolerances, installation trim procedures, as well as for engine deterioration \\nthat can be expected between heavy maintenance intervals.  The applicant should also consider \\nthe range of ambient temperature and takeoff altitude conditions encounter ed during the engine’s \\nservice life, as well as the impact  of cold and hot engine starts. \\n(3) Secondary Air System Analysis. \\n(a) The applicant must establish the pressure, thermal and mechanical loads that \\nmust be sustained by the life-limited parts.  This requires heat transfer and structural analyses \\nthat depend on boundary conditions wh ich are derived from the internal performance parameters.  \\nThe boundary conditions are determined for each f light condition using analytical and empirical \\nengineering processes. \\n(b) The applicant may use aerodynamic design software based on well established \\naerodynamic design principles and theory to determine the flow path interstage data—gas temperatures, pressures and mass flow.  In the ca se of a compressor and tu rbine, this should be \\n9 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\nthe detailed interstage data a ssociated with each individual blade and vane row.  Based on this \\ninformation, the applicant should determine the ga s loads and air temperatures applied to the \\nairfoils. \\n(c) The interstage data serves as boundary  conditions for the secondary airflow \\nsystem analysis.  This software predicts the ai r temperature, pressure and air flow within the \\nengine case and the rotor cavities, including th e cavity recirculation, hot gas ingestion and \\nleakage paths used as the boundary conditions for the heat transfer analysis.  The cavity \\npressures are also used as boundary c onditions for the structural analysis. \\n(d) The applicant must ensure the accuracy  of the secondary airflow system \\nsoftware by calibrating the software  using engine and rig testing. \\n(4) Heat Transfer Analysis.  The applicant must determine the temperature levels \\nassociated with each life-limited part to ensure the cyclic stresses and strains produced by the \\nthermal loads/temperature gradients are addresse d adequately.  To ensure the most damaging \\nstresses are determined, the applicant must de termine the component steady state and transient \\ntemperatures for each segment of the flight prof ile so that a complete temperature profile for \\neach flight profile is determined.  The heat transfer analyses usually require the use of \\nsophisticated software tools which use the boundary conditions determined by the aerodynamic \\ndesign and internal flow analyses. The analy tical model should incorporate the appropriate \\nthermal material properties and requires knowledge of the various heat transfer coefficients \\nderived from the boundary conditions and empirical correlations.  The applicant should correlate \\nand verify experimentally the steady state and transient component temperatures during engine \\ndevelopment testing. \\n(5) Stress Analysis. \\n(a) Stress analysis is part of the process us ed to identify the life-limiting locations \\nand the life limit for each life-limited part.  The stress analysis techniques include analytical and \\nempirical processes that are used to determine th e stress-strain distributions for each life-limited \\ncomponent.  These techniques must be capable of identifying the cyclic stresses and strains for \\neach potential life-limiting location and of ev aluating the effects of  engine rotor speed, \\nmechanical and pressure loads, thermal gradie nts, assembly preloads and loads applied by \\nmating parts for the entire flight cycle.  The a pplicant should focus particular attention on the \\nconcentrated stress locations such as bores, holes, changes in section, flanges, welds and \\nattachment slots.  The level of analysis should be sufficient to fu lly define the stress-strain state \\nversus time for the entire flight profile and shou ld be capable of predicting the three dimensional \\n(3-D) stress-strain state.  This is usually acco mplished with the use of two dimensional (2-D) \\naxisymmetric and three dimensional finite element techniques. \\n(b) The applicant should validate stress an alysis techniques by experimental \\nmeasurements or other acceptable means. \\n(c) The applicant should conduct studies that  identify the proper use of stress \\nanalysis techniques, and identify the steps required to achieve accurate results.  For finite \\nelement techniques, examples include: \\n10 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\n\\uf0b7 Situations that require the use of axisymmetric (2-D) techniques; \\n\\uf0b7 Situations that requir e the use of non-axisymme tric (3-D) techniques; \\n\\uf0b7 Mesh density requirements; \\n\\uf0b7 Control of element aspect ratio, and\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Method of computing poten tial stress errors. \\nThe stress analysis techniques must be capable  of determining the actual true minimum and \\nmaximum stresses-strains at the life-limiting locations.  This determination should account for \\nthe non-linear inelastic material behavior based on the actual stress-stain  curves.  An acceptable \\nalternative would be for the appl icant to ensure the stress analysis techniques used to analyze \\neach part are consistent with those used to analy ze the fatigue tests used to establish the life of \\nthe part. If the stress analysis techniques are based on purely elastic behavior, then the applicant \\nshould ensure the fatigue test results are repr esentative of engine operating conditions.  The \\napplicant may use various notch models, such as Neuber or Glinka, or inelastic finite element \\ntechniques. \\n(6) Crack Initiation Life. \\n(a) The applicant should employ a procedure that combines the stress-strain and \\ntemperature histories with the appr opriate material and cyclic fatigue test data to establish the \\nlow cycle fatigue crack initiation life for the mi nimum property part.  Also, the applicant should \\nconsider plasticity and creep related effects. \\n(b) The crack initiation life mode l for each material is based on test data obtained \\nfrom cyclic fatigue testing of laboratory, sub-component/feature base d tests, or component tests.  \\nThe model should account for the manufacturing pro cesses that affect the low cyclic fatigue \\ncapability, including fabrication from the pr oduction grade materials and manufacturing \\nmethods.  The applicant should perform sufficient testing to evaluate the effects of elevated \\ntemperatures and hold times, as well as interactio n with other material failure mechanisms such \\nas high-cycle fatigue and creep.  Appropriate service experien ce gained through a successful \\nprogram of parts retirement, precautionary samp ling inspections, or cyclic component tests may \\nbe included to calibrate the life prediction system.  The life prediction system should also \\naccount for environmental effects, such as vibration, corrosion and cumulative damage. \\n(c) Test data should be reduced using appr opriate statistical techniques to account \\nfor inherent scatter and should be expressed in te rms of an acceptable part risk level, which is 1 \\ncracked part out of 1000 (B.1 life) or alternately 1 in 740 (-3 sigma) .  Part fatigue life should be \\nquoted in terms of the minimum number of f light cycles required to initiate a crack \\napproximately 1/32\" or 0.030\" (0.762 mm) in length. \\n(d) When the fatigue life is based on a cyclic test of a specific part or parts, the \\napplicant must correct the test results for inhere nt fatigue scatter and for the differences between \\nthe test and engine operation. The factors used to account for scatter should be justified.  To use \\nthis approach, applicants should design the test to  reproduce, as nearly as  possible, the engine \\ncritical operating conditions in terms of the cyclic  stresses, strains, and temperature level at the \\nlife-limiting feature, such as the,  bore, rim, or blade attachment slot.  The applicant should use \\nsufficient analytical and empirical  tools so the differences between  the engine conditions and the \\n11 \\n\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\ncyclic test are understood, and the safe life can be  adjusted to account for the differences.  If the \\ntest is terminated by burst or comp lete failure, then crack initiation for this particular test may be \\ndefined using the appropriate crack growth calcula tions and/or fracture su rface observations.  An \\nalternate approach would be to us e the number of cycles at the last  clean inspection to define the \\ncrack initiation point. This appr oach requires an inspection techni que with a level of detection \\ncapability consistent with that used by the engine industry for rotating parts. \\n(7) Damage Tolerance Assessments.  The applicant should perform appropriate \\ndamage tolerance assessments to minimize the pot ential for failure from material, manufacturing, \\nand service-induced anomalies within the approved life of the part.  Servic e experience with gas \\nturbine engines has demonstrated that material , manufacturing and service-induced anomalies do \\noccur, and they can potentially degrade the stru ctural integrity of the life-limited parts. \\nHistorically, the life determination process has been founded on the assumption that life-limited \\nparts do not contain anomalies.  Consequently, this methodology has not e xplicitly addressed the \\noccurrence of such anomalies, although some leve l of tolerance for anomalies is implicitly built \\ninto the methodology using design margins, factory and field inspections, etc.  Damage tolerance \\nassessments, however, explicitly address the anomalous condition(s) and complement the safe \\nlife approach. The intent of damage tolerance as sessments is to supplement the existing safe life \\nmethodology; they are not intended to allow life- limited parts to remain in service beyond the \\nlimits established by the safe life approach or to allow rotating parts to return to service with \\ncracks. \\n(a) Type of anomalies. \\n1 Material anomalies.  Material anoma lies consist of abnormal discontinuities \\nor non-homogeneities introduced during the prod uction of the raw material or the melting \\nprocess. Examples of material  anomalies are:  hard alpha in  titanium; oxide/carbide (slag); \\nstringers in nickel alloys; and contaminant ceram ic particulates in powder metallurgy materials \\nunintentionally generated during powder manufacturing. \\n2 Manufacturing anomalies.  Manufactur ing anomalies include anomalies \\nproduced in the conversion of the in got to billet and billet to forg ing steps, as well as anomalies \\ngenerated by the metal removal and finishing pr ocesses used during manufacture and/or factory \\nrepair. Examples of conversion related anomalie s are forging laps and strain induced porosity.  \\nExamples of metal removal related anomalies ar e:  tears due to bro aching; arc burns from \\nvarious sources; and disturbed microstructure due to localized overhea ting of the machined \\nsurface or to inadvertent contac t with a tool or fixture. \\n3 Service-induced anomalies.  Applican ts should consider service-induced \\nanomalies such as non-repaired nicks, dings and scratches, and corrosion.  Applicants should use \\n12 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\nsimilarity of hardware design, installation, and exposure and maintenance practice to determine \\nrelevance of the experience. \\n(b) Probabilistic Damage Tolerance Ri sk Assessments (PDTRA).  The \\nprobabilistic approach to damage  tolerance assessment is one of two elements necessary to \\nappropriately assess damage tolerance.  The se cond element is service damage monitoring (see \\nparagraph 8.d.(7)(e) of this AC). AC 33.14-1 in cludes an example of th e probabilistic process \\nthat applies to hard alpha ma terial anomalies in titanium alloy rotor components.  The \\nprobabilistic damage tolerance risk assessment is fracture mechanics-based and typically \\nincludes the following primary elements: \\n1 Anomaly size and frequency distribu tions.  A key input in the damage \\ntolerance assessment is the size and rate of occu rrence of anomalies.  This information may be \\nstatistical in nature and may be  presented in a form that plots the number of inclusions that \\nexceed a particular size in a specified amount of material.  Anomalies should be treated as sharp \\npropagating cracks from the first stre ss cycle, unless there is sufficient data to indicate otherwise. \\n2 Anomaly growth analysis.  This determin es the number of cycles for a given \\nanomaly to grow to a critical size.  This predic tion should be based on kn owledge of part stress, \\ntemperature, geometry, stress gradient, anomal y orientation, and materi al properties.  The \\nanalysis approach should be validat ed against relevant test data.  In this context, anomaly growth \\nmay be based solely on crack propagation, or a co mbination of crack initiation (i.e. incubation) \\nand crack propagation, depending on the nature of the anomaly/damage. \\n3 Inspection techniques and intervals.  Manufacturing and in-service \\ninspections are options available to reduce the risk of fracture from inherent and induced \\nanomalies.  The applicant should identify the inte rvals for each specified in-service inspection.  \\nHistorical engine removal rates and module and part availability data could serve as the basis for \\nestablishing an inspection interval.  The manufacturing inspections assumed in the damage \\ntolerance assessments should be incorporated into the manufacturing plan.  Likewise, the \\nassumed in-service inspection procedures and intervals should be integrated into the service \\nmanagement plan and included, as a ppropriate, in the ALS of the ICA. \\n4 Inspection Probability of Detection (POD).  POD of the individual \\ninspection processes, such as eddy-current, penetran t fluid or ultrasonic, us ed to detect potential \\nanomalies should be based on the statistical review of sufficient quantities of relevant testing or \\nexperience. The relevance of the data should be based on the similarity of parameters such as: \\n\\uf0b7 Size, shape, orientation, location, and chemical or metallurgical \\ncharacter of the anomaly; \\n\\uf0b7 Surface condition and cleanliness of the parts; \\n\\uf0b7 Material being inspected, such  as its composition, grain size, \\nconductivity, and su rface texture; \\n\\uf0b7 Variation of inspection materials or  equipment such as the specific \\npenetrant fluid and developer and equipment capability or condition; \\n\\uf0b7 Specific inspection process paramete rs, such as scan index; and \\n13 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  7/31/09 \\t AC 33.70-1 \\n\\uf0b7\\t Inspector’s capabilities and limitations,  such as visual acuity, attention \\nspan, and training. \\n5 Risk Prediction and Allowable Risk. The inputs are integrated using risk \\nassessment software which predicts the relative pr obability of failure (POF) for each part.  The \\npredicted POF is compared to specific allowable design target risk values.  Note the allowable \\nDTRs can be found in advisory circulars which addr ess specific materials and/or anomaly types.  \\nDesigns that satisfy the allowable DTR values will  be considered in comp liance with the damage \\ntolerance requirements.  Part manufacturers have a variety of  options to reduce the POF and \\nachieve the level of relative ri sk allowed by the DTR.  These options include, but are not limited \\nto: \\n\\uf0b7 Component redesign \\n\\uf0b7 Material change \\n\\uf0b7 Material process improvements \\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturing process improvements \\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturing inspection improvements \\n\\uf0b7 Enhanced in-service inspections, and \\n\\uf0b7 Life limit reduction. \\n(c) Appropriate Damage Tolerance Assessments \\n1 Interim Compliance Options.  When an industry or company specific \\nPDTRA approach has been established and accept ed by the FAA, it may be used to meet the \\nintent of the “appropriate damage tolerance assessments” of § 33.70.  The FAA acknowledges \\nthat key elements of this approach, such as  the anomaly size and frequency distributions, \\nstandardized analysis techniques, and the relative allowable risk ta rgets are not available in every \\ncase. In these instances, a range of comp liance options may be considered such as: \\n\\uf0b7\\t A simplified conservative probabilistic approach. \\n\\uf0b7\\t A deterministic fracture mechanics approach. \\n\\uf0b7\\t Comparison to successful historical experience based on crack growth \\nrate calculations. \\n\\uf0b7\\t Design margins based on crack  growth rate calculations. \\n\\uf0b7\\t Fatigue testing of simulated damage. \\n\\uf0b7\\t Application of damage tolerance concepts. \\n2 Appropriate Use of Interim Complia nce Options and Interim Surface \\nDamage Tolerance Requirements.  When new info rmation is developed and approved that allows \\nthe application of the probabilistic approach to a particular disk/rotor feature or anomaly type, \\nthe interim guidance provided by paragraphs 8.d.(7 )(c)1 and 8.d.(7)(d) of th is AC do not apply. \\n3 Appropriate use of Probabilistic Risk Assessment Techniques.  The use of \\nprobabilistic risk assessme nt techniques should not be considered  an alternate approach to meet \\nthe intent of § 33.70. As required by the rule, lif e limits must be based on the minimum number \\n14 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 02/24/17 AC 33.70-1, Chg 1 \\nof flights required to ini tiate a crack as described in the prev ious paragraphs, and is normally the \\nonly acceptable means to determine rotating part life limits.  The exception is when the risk of \\nfailure from an anomalous condition is higher than acceptable, and the life limit is lowered to \\ncontrol the risk of failure. In th is case, probabilistic risk assessme nt tools may be used to address \\ncontinued airworthiness issues asso ciated with part life shortfalls  and certain part conditions that \\ncannot be eliminated by the best available manuf acturing processes and in spections techniques.  \\nProbabilistic risk assessment tools may not be used to relax existing well-established industry \\nbest practices. In addition, use of probabili stic risk assessment tools to reject improved \\nmanufacturing and inspection techni ques, or other changes of similar nature, will require careful \\nconsideration and may need to meet higher standa rds.  Alternate approaches must be discussed \\nwith and approved by the F AA on a case-by-case basis. \\n(d) Interim Surface Damage Tolerance Requi rements.  Currently, the required \\ninput data (anomaly size and fr equency distributions, etc.) have  not been developed to fully \\nimplement the probabilistic approach in all cases.  This information is not available for all the \\nvarious anomaly types and all required rotor features/locations.  When an appropriate \\nprobabilistic approach is not av ailable, applicants should adhe re to the following interim \\nguidance, which reflects industry benchmarked de sign criteria that ensure a minimum level of \\ndamage tolerance is built in to new rotor designs.  Rotating component surfaces must possess a residual crack growth life equal to at least 3,000 damage tolera nce  cycles or a number of \\ndamage tolerance cycles equal to  50% of the part cer tified life, whichever is less, assuming an \\ninitial surface crack of  0.030 inches long and 0.015 inches deep  and/or a corner crack equal to \\n0.015 x 0.015 inches. The damage tolerance cycle us ed in this assessmen t is the major stress-\\ncycle (min-max-min) from the missions used in the LCF certification analysis for standard day \\nconditions. These calculations shou ld be based on the use of linear elastic fracture with cracks \\nplaced in the most unfavorable orientation and location and may use compressive residual \\nstresses and inelastic stresses.  Applicants mu st identify any additional assumptions associated \\nwith the residual crack growth life calculations.  These assumptions must be discussed with and \\napproved by the FAA on a case-by-case basis. \\n(e) Service Damage Monitoring.  The overall objective of Service Damage \\nMonitoring is to review data obtained from field operation of the type design engine to determine if there are anomalous conditions that require co rrective action.  Appropria te actions may include \\nassessment of the impact of damage observe d on one part/location on other parts/locations. \\nApplicants should determine if surface damage  that has been detected is consistent \\nwith the serviceable and repairable limits and to  determine if additional actions are required to \\nprevent failure and rectify any potential unsaf e conditions which may be identified.  Service \\ndamage monitoring consists of the following steps: \\n1 Determine the serviceable and repairab le surface damage limits using a \\nprocess approved by the FAA and summarized within the service management plan.  Damage size limits should be a function of  part, part location, and damage  type.  Damage should include, \\nbut is not limited to, nicks, dents, and scratches.   The serviceable and repa irable limits should be \\npublished in the ICA. \\n15 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 02/24/17 AC 33.70-1, Chg 1 \\n2 Establish a monitoring process to reco rd damage that meets all of the \\nfollowing criteria; (a) is inconsistent with or exceeds the repairable limits, and (b) is made \\navailable to the type certificate holder or supplemental type ce rtificate holder through existing \\nreporting channels. Document the monitoring pro cess in the service management plan.  This \\nactivity should record at a minimum the damage size, type, and locati on observed during service \\ninspections for each life-limited part. \\n3 Assess damage meeting the criteria defined in paragraph 2 above. This \\nassessment should consider the following, as a minimum: \\n\\uf0b7 The impact of the observed damage on the life of the damaged part. \\n\\uf0b7 The likelihood for recurrence of similar damage. \\n\\uf0b7 Whether the damaged part was found during a field inspection. \\n\\uf0b7 Whether the damage is likely to go undetected and escape to the field.\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Recommended corrective actions to id entify, prevent, or eliminate the \\nsource of the damage. \\n4 During the service life of the part, th e damage information obtained by the \\ndamage monitoring process, as well as the corre ctive actions implemented, should be reported to \\nthe authorities during continue d airworthiness discussions. \\ne. Establishment of Life Limits - Static Parts. \\n(1) This section applies to major static struct ural parts whose prim ary failure is likely \\nto result in one of the hazardous en gine effects listed in § 33.75.  It  does not apply to static parts \\nwhose failure is not likely to re sult in a hazardous engine effect. \\n(2) The general principles used to establish lif e limits for static parts are similar to \\nthose used for rotating parts.  However, for pressu re-loaded static parts, th e point at which a part \\nmust be removed from service may differ from roto r parts.  For rotor parts, life limits are based \\non the initiation of a crack. For pressure-loaded static parts, the approved life may be based on \\nthe crack initiation life, plus a portion of the residual crack gr owth life, providing the following \\nprovisions are met: \\n\\uf0b7 The crack growth analysis techni que is experimentally verified. \\n\\uf0b7 The useable portion of residual crack grow th life maintains a safe margin to \\nfailure. \\n\\uf0b7 Mandatory inspections are incorporated into the service management plan and \\nthe ICA if there is any de pendence on crack detection. \\n\\uf0b7 The reliability of the crack detec tion technique has been verified. \\n\\uf0b7 All regulations must be met assuming the presence of the maximum predicted \\nsize crack that can occur with in the approved life of the part.  In some cases, it \\nmay be necessary to limit the crack size allowed in service in order to meet \\nregulations other than § 33.70, such as the blade containment requirement in \\n§ 33.19. \\n16 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\n(3) Other major structural static parts beside s rotating and pressure -loaded static parts \\nmay be identified as life-limited pa rts.  Under these circumstances, applicants should discuss the \\nmethodology for determining the life of the part with the FAA certification office which must \\napprove its use. Applicants should use the genera l principles for rotating  and static pressure \\nloaded parts as a guide. \\n(4) The following table provides an overview of  the various lifing elements contained \\nwithin the rotating part and the static part methodologies: \\nTable 1. Overview of Lifing Elements. \\nRotating Part \\nElement Applicable to \\nStatic Parts Comments \\nFlight Profiles Yes \\nEngine Performance Yes \\nInternal Flow Analysis Yes \\nHeat Transfer Analysis Yes \\nStructural Analysis Yes Flight maneuver loads required. \\nCrack Initiation Life Yes Large number of options \\navailable. Range from a cyclic test of a single component to a fully developed crack initiation model. \\nDamage Tolerance Assessment No See additional comments in \\nparagraph 8.e.(7). \\nService Life Certification Yes \\n(5) Life-limited static parts may be repaired a nd returned to servi ce providing the life \\nlimit is re-established using methods equivalent to the methods used to establish the life of a new \\npart. \\n(6) The cyclic loads that must be supported by static parts also differ from those of \\nrotating parts. For rotating pa rts, the major loads usually involve centrifugal forces and \\ntemperature gradients, while the minor loads include  applied pressure loads.  For pressure-loaded \\nstatic parts, the major loads usually involve inte rnal pressure and flight  maneuver loads as well \\nas thermal gradients. \\n(7) Certain static part constr uction techniques, such as welding or casting, contain \\ninherent anomalies.  For these cases, the appl icant should consider a fracture mechanics-based \\napproach as part of the methodol ogy to establish the life of the part.  This approach should be \\nbased on an understanding of the type and size of the anomalies that will be present in the part.  In these instances, the applicant may base the li fe limit on the crack initiation life plus a portion \\nof the residual crack growth life, providing a safe margin to failure/burst can be maintained.  The applicant should experimentally validate the cycles  required to initiate a crack from an anomaly \\n17 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\nand the crack growth analysis tech niques.  If the anomaly is assume d initially to be a crack, then \\nonly the crack growth analysis techni ques require experimental verification. \\n(8) In determining the life of the part, the a pplicant should consider the temperature of \\nthe part, the temperature gradients, and any si gnificant vibratory loads or other loads (for \\nexample, flight maneuver loads), as well as the pressure loads. \\n(9) Manufacturing and service inspections are options available to reduce fracture \\npotential. The applicant shoul d incorporate the manufacturing inspections that are deemed \\nnecessary into the manufacturi ng plan.  If the approved life limit includes reliance on the \\ndetection of cracks, the reliability of the crack  detection techniques must be considered.  Any \\ndependence upon crack detection must result in mandatory inspection techniques and intervals \\nbeing included in the service management plan a nd in the ALS of the ICA.  Engine removal rates \\nand module and piece part availability data may se rve as the basis for es tablishing the inspection \\ninterval. \\nf. Certification of the Approved Life. \\n(1) This element requires the applicant to submit the part life, based on approved \\ntechniques, to the FAA with sufficient supporting data.  The applicant is responsible for \\nsupplying sufficient data to suppor t the part life.  The FAA ma y approve, if appropriate, an \\napproved life that is less than the part life. A list of the life-limited part s and their approved life \\nmust be included in the engine shop manual in the ALS of the ICA as required by § 33.4.  The approved life is the mandatory retirement life. \\n(2) The engine shop manual must contain an approved life for ea ch life-limited part, \\neven if the safe life and/or the approved life ar e extremely long and exceed the design lifetime of \\nthe aircraft.  This will ensure part usage is recorded and tracked properly. \\ng. Maintaining the Approved Life. \\n(1) At certification, the approved life of th e part is based on predicted engine \\noperation, material behavior, and environment.  After certification, the a pplicant may need to \\ncheck the accuracy of these pred ictions, recognizing that many as pects of the lifing system may \\nchange during its life. For example, the e ngine’s usage and its operating environment may \\nchange after a change of ownership. The appli cant should use service feedback to confirm any \\nassumptions made in the engineering plan remain  valid or to determine if modifications are \\nrequired. The engineering plan should describe no t only the basis of the part’s approved life but \\nalso those actions subsequent to certification needed to ensure the approved life is appropriate \\nthroughout the operational life of the engine. \\n(2) The applicant must regularly review the assumptions made when establishing the \\napproved life. The engineering pl an should detail when these re views should occur, and what \\ninformation is necessary to complete the reviews.   Aspects that should be considered include, but \\nare not limited to: \\n\\uf0b7 The frequency of approved life reviews. \\n\\uf0b7 Detailed inspection of service expos ed parts including retired parts. \\n18 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\n\\uf0b7 Review of flight profile. \\n\\uf0b7 Findings during maintenance. \\n\\uf0b7 Engine development experience. \\n\\uf0b7 Lessons learned from other engine projects. \\n\\uf0b7 Any service events.\\n \\nh. Influencing Parts. Engine life-limited parts ar e part of a complex system in which other \\nengine parts can affect the lif e-limited parts, including their li fe capability.  Therefore, the \\nengineering plan must consider  these other parts and particul arly any changes to them.  \\nExamples of influencing parts incl ude a turbine blade, a mating flange or seal, and a static part \\nthat impacts the environment (temperatures, pres sures, etc.) around a life-limited part.  Examples \\nof changes to these parts include a heavier blade;  a new mating part with a different coefficient \\nof thermal expansion; orifices and clearances affecting cooling air fl ow; and geometric or \\nmaterial changes to a static part  that modify the thermal respons e and/or the mechanical response \\nof the part. \\n9. GUIDANCE FOR DEFINING A MANUFACTURING PLAN. \\na. Introduction. The manufacturing plan is a portion of the overall integrity process \\nintended to ensure the life capability of the pa rt.  The engineering plan includes assumptions \\nabout how engine life-limited pa rts are designed, manufactured, operated, and maintained.  Each \\ncan affect the part’s life.  Therefore, it is es sential for the applicant to ensure the attributes \\nrequired by the engineering plan remain valid and are achieved during manufacture. \\nb. Elements of a Manufacturing Plan. The part specific manufacturing plan should \\nconsider the attributes of the part delivered by the manufacturing process, and should highlight \\nthe processing parameters that affect the life of the part.  The plan should also identify the \\nprocess parameters that should not be change d without proper verifi cation and engineering \\napproval. Many of the parameters may be included by reference to other documents (see \\nparagraph 7.e. of this AC). The para meters may include, but are not limited to: \\n\\uf0b7 Material controls includi ng zoned areas that requ ire special properties.\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturing method specifications. \\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturing process steps and sequence. \\n\\uf0b7 Cutting parameters and scatter allowed. \\n\\uf0b7 Inspection method and sensitivity. \\n\\uf0b7 Special part rough machining me thods or finishing method(s). \\n\\uf0b7 Methods intended to improve fatigue capab ility or minimize induced anomalies. \\n\\uf0b7 Process validation to qualif y the impact of the manuf acturing method variation on \\nthe part’s life capability.\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Compliance with microstructural requirements. \\n\\uf0b7 Surface finish. \\n\\uf0b7 Residual stress profile\\n \\n19 \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 \\t AC 33.70-1 \\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturing controls to ensure that parts are produced by a consistent and \\nrepeatable process. \\n\\uf0b7 Traceability records for each part. \\n\\uf0b7 Review of non-conforming parts to ensure  the deviation does not adversely impact \\nthe life of the part. \\nc. Development and Verification of the Manufacturing Plan. \\n(1) The manufacturing plan shoul d be reviewed and verifi ed by the key engineering \\nand manufacturing personnel with the following technical skills: \\n\\uf0b7 Engineering (Design and Lifing). \\n\\uf0b7 Material Engineering. \\n\\uf0b7 Non-Destructive Inspection. \\n\\uf0b7 Quality Assurance.\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Manufacturing Engineering (D evelopment and Production). \\n(2) These personnel should evaluate and a pprove process validation, the rules for \\nchange control, non-conformance disposition, and corrective actions to en sure the manufacturing \\nproduct is consistent with the design assumptions of the engineering plan.  The intent is to \\nensure: \\n\\uf0b7\\t Manufacturing processes are developed and applied with the appropriate \\nlevel of oversight to ensure the part li fe capability required in the engineering \\nplan is consistently achieved. \\n\\uf0b7 Substantiation programs are agreed to up- front and executed as part of the \\nprocess validation. \\n\\uf0b7 Changes to the manufacturing processe s and practices are visible and are \\nmade with cross-function al review and approval. \\n\\uf0b7 Non-conformances are reviewed by the appropriate personnel with the required skill mix prior to disposition. \\n\\uf0b7 Corrective action is implemented for non-conformances that have been \\ndetected. \\n(3) The level of detail in the plan may vary  depending on the specific process step \\nbeing considered, the sensitivity of the particular  process step, and the level of control required \\nto achieve the required life capability. \\n(4) Example.  A process specification exists to  control the drilling of holes.  If the use \\nof this specification produces a hole that meets the life capability requirements for a flange bolt \\nhole, then the plan may simply note that this fl ange bolt hole will be produced according to the \\nstandard specification. However,  if a rim air hole requires cold  expansion following drilling to \\nmeet the life requirements, then it may be necessary to reference the cold expansion process \\nspecification in addition to th e hole drilling sp ecification. \\n20 \\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\n10. GUIDANCE FOR DEFINING A SERVICE MANAGEMENT PLAN. \\na. Introduction. The service management plan is part of the process to maintain the \\nintegrity of engine life-limited parts throughout their service life. The engineering plan includes \\nassumptions about the way in which life-li mited parts are manufactured, operated and \\nmaintained.  Each can affect the life of the part .  It is, therefore, essential to ensure these \\nassumptions remain valid.  The service management plan conveys the constraints for in-service \\nrepair, maintenance, and overhaul to remain c onsistent with the assumptions made in the \\nengineering plan. \\nb. Elements of a Service Management Plan. The part-specific service management plan \\nshould consider the part attributes  that engineering has identified as significant for part life, and \\nshould not be changed by the processes applied to the part during se rvice.  The service \\nmanagement plan should include the means to mon itor the service of life-li mited parts to ensure \\nthe operational assumptions remain valid.  The plan may include, but is not limited to, the following information: \\n\\uf0b7 Maintenance and overhaul limitations. \\n\\uf0b7 Repair processes limitations. \\n\\uf0b7 Operator’s responsibility to maintain se rvice records traceable to a particular \\nengine and part, as requ ired by FAA regulations. \\n\\uf0b7 Inspection interval (if required). \\n\\uf0b7 Inspection procedure (if required). \\n\\uf0b7 Monitoring operational flight profiles. \\n\\uf0b7 Damage and repairable limits. \\n\\uf0b7 Periodic technical reviews of se rvice and related experience. \\nc. Determining the Acceptability of Repair , Maintenance and Overhaul Processes. \\n(1) Repair, maintenance, and overhaul pro cesses should be reviewed by personnel \\nwith the following technical skills: \\n\\uf0b7 Engineering (Design and Lifing). \\n\\uf0b7 Material Engineering. \\n\\uf0b7 Non-Destructive inspection. \\n\\uf0b7 Quality Assurance.\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Product Support Engineering. \\n\\uf0b7 Repair Development Engineering. \\n(2) The skills needed for this cross-functional review are consistent with those needed \\nto evaluate the manufacturing plan.  The review should incl ude process validation, change \\ncontrol, non-conformance, and co rrective actions to ensure that  all repair, maintenance, or \\noverhaul processes are consistent with engineer ing requirements.  The following benefits are \\nderived from the review: \\n21 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n 02/24/17 \\t AC 33.70-1, Chg 1 \\n\\uf0b7\\t Repair, maintenance, and overhaul pr ocesses and practices are developed \\nwith the appropriate level of oversight, and their possible impact on the life \\nof the part is considered. Substantia tion programs are agreed to up-front and \\nexecuted as part of th e validation process. \\n\\uf0b7 Changes to the processes and practices are visible to all parties and are made with cross-functional review and approval. \\n\\uf0b7 Non-conformances are reviewed by the appropriate skill mix prior to \\ndisposition. \\n\\uf0b7 Corrective action is implemented for non-conformances which have been detected. \\n(3) To ensure the service management processes are properly implemented and \\ncontrolled, the applicant should cl early define the limitations to repair, maintenance and overhaul \\nprocedures in the ICA. These procedures should also include clearly defined limitations \\nassociated with these processes and practices to ensure that engine critical life-limited parts \\nmaintain the required attributes consistent with those assumed in the engineering plan.  This is \\nnecessary since inappropriate repair or maintenance could affect the inte grity of the part and \\nresult in a hazardous effect. \\nd. Static Parts Service Management. Due to potential differences in the approach to \\ndetermining the life of static parts, especially of pressure cases, the applicant should include \\nadditional information in the shop manual.  The a pplicant should place this information, which is \\nin addition to the approved life,  in the ALS.  The additional in formation may include, but is not \\nlimited to: \\n\\uf0b7 A periodic inspection interval. \\n\\uf0b7 The inspection method(s) to be used. \\n\\uf0b7 A detailed description of the area(s) to be inspected. \\n\\uf0b7 Acceptance and rejection criteria as sociated with inspection results.\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Acceptable repair method(s), if applicable.\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Other instructions deemed necessary to ensure that inspections are executed \\nproperly. \\n\\uf0b7 Required maintenance and the limitati ons associated with maintenance. \\n11.  AIRWORTHINESS LIMITATION SECTION. \\na. The Airworthiness Limitation Section (ALS) of the engine manuals required by § 33.4 \\nsets out the mandatory replacement times, inspecti on intervals, and related procedures necessary \\nfor type certification. The engine design engine ering and service management plans required by \\n§ 33.70 also highlight the importance of the limits to in-service maintena nce and repair of life-\\nlimited parts identified in the ALS.  Since any ma intenance or repair coul d theoretically affect \\nthe integrity of a life-limited part  in a hazardous manner, an applicant may want to use the ALS \\nto advise operators of the conseque nces of repairs to life-limited part s.  If an applicant elects to \\ninclude such an advisory statement, we r ecommend that it read similar to the following. \\n22 \\n\\n  \\n \\n \\n 7/31/09 AC 33.70-1 \\n“The following airworthiness limitations have been developed based on \\nengineering analysis that assumes this  product will be operated and maintained \\nusing the procedures and inspections provi ded in the Instructions for Continued \\nAirworthiness supplied with th is product by the type certif icate holder.  Repairs or \\nalterations to engine life-limited parts us ing other data warran t additional analyses \\nto assess the potential effect on ai rworthiness characteristics and these \\nlimitations.” \\nCaution: Applicants should not attempt to incorporate any statement into the ALS that limits or eliminates an operator’s option to use FAA-appr oved repairs, alterations, or PMA parts in an \\nengine. Such a statement would be cont rary to FAA’s policies and regulations. \\nb. For engines with One-Engine-Inoperative (OEI) ratings, the ALS should include a \\nmethod to track the number of cycles of opera tion at the OEI ratings because these ratings \\noperate at higher speeds and temperatures than non-OEI operating conditions.  Applicants may \\naccomplish this by adding a finite number of cycles to the expended life of the affected engine life-limited parts or by using appropriate life reduction factors for each of the OEI power excursions. \\n//signed by Francis A.

PURPOSE . This advisory circular (AC) provides guidance and acceptable methods, but \\nnot the only methods, that may be used to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of §33.4 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Instructions for Continued Airworthiness. This AC deals with instructions for in-service inspections of safety critical turbine engine parts. The need for in-service inspections is determined by a qualitative assessment of the safety implications of a cracked safety critical part. The in-service inspections should be conducted each time one of these safety critical parts is completely disassembled, unless the part has been inspected within the last 100 cycles in service. \\n2. RELATED REGULATIONS.\\n a. Section 33.4, Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\\n b. Part 33 Appendix A, Sections A33.3(a)(6) and A33.3(b)(2), Instructions for Continued \\nAirworthiness. 3. RELATED REFERENCE MATERIAL.\\n a. AC 33-2B, Aircraft Engine Type Certification Handbook, dated June 30, 1993.\\n b. AC 33.4-1, Instructions for Continued Airworthiness, dated August 27, 1999.\\n c. Joint FAA – Aerospace Industries Association (AIA) report, Propulsion System and \\nAuxiliary Power Unit (APU) Related Aircraft Safety Hazards, dated October 25, 1999. \\nAC 33.4-2 3/8/01\\n \\n4. DEFINITIONS. The following terms are defined for the purpose of this AC:\\n a. Continued Airworthiness Assessment Methodology (CAAM) Level 3 Hazard or Event . \\nA CAAM level 3 hazard or event is a propulsion system or auxiliary power unit (APU) \\nmalfunction that involves substantial damage to the aircraft or second unrelated system, small penetrations of aircraft fuel lines or aircraft fuel tanks, significant damage to a second engine system, uncontrolled fires, rapid cabin depressurization, permanent loss of thrust or power greater than one propulsion system, inability to climb and maintain flight at least 1000 feet above terrain, or impairment of aircraft controllability.\\n b. CAAM Level 4 Hazard or Event . A level 4 hazard or event is a propulsion system or \\nAPU malfunction that involves forced landing, loss of aircraft (hull loss), fatalities, or serious injuries.\\n c. Critical Feature. A critical feature is an attribute, characteristic, or property of a part that \\nresults in the part having relatively high stress, susceptibility to handling damage or foreign object damage (FOD), or low tolerance to material or other anomalies.\\n d. Damage Tolerance. Damage tolerance is an element of the turbine engine component \\ndesign and life management process that accounts for potential component imperfections. Component imperfections could result from inherent material structure, material processing, component design, manufacturing or usage. Damage tolerance addresses component imperfections by incorporating appropriate combinations of fracture-resistant design, fracture mechanics, process control, and nondestructive inspection.\\n e. Eddy Current Inspection (ECI). ECI is a nondestructive testing method in which eddy \\ncurrent flow is induced in a test object. Variations in the test object cause changes in the flow that are detected by a nearby coil or a Hall effect device for subsequent analysis.\\n f. In-service Inspection . An in-service inspection is a detailed inspection of a specific critical \\nfeature or area of a part.\\n g. Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection (FPI). FPI is a surface crack detection process that \\nuses a penetrating fluid with a fluorescent suspension to enter crack separations by capillary action. A black light is used to visually detect cracks containing this fluid.\\n h. Hazard Ratio . The hazard ratio is the percent of total events of a particular turbine \\npropulsion system or APU malfunction or failure that has serious or severe consequences (i.e., hazard level 3 or 4). \\nPage 2 Par 4 \\n  3/8/01 AC 33.4-2\\n \\ni. Line-of-Sight . Line-of-sight refers to the qualitative assessment of the ability to visually \\ninspect piece-part features. Deep holes or features that are obstructed by adjacent part \\nfeatures, narrow access passages, etc., are considered to have poor “line-of-sight” inspection capability.\\n j. Non-Destructive Inspection (NDI). An NDI is any inspection that identifies stress, strain, \\ndimensional, crack or flaw characteristics without compromising the integrity or airworthiness of the part.\\n k. Piece-Part Opportunity . Piece-part opportunity is the opportunity to perform in-service \\ninspection of safety critical parts when such parts are completely disassembled in accordance with the manufacturer’s or other FAA-approved maintenance or overhaul manual instructions. Inspections are triggered by opportunity, not by a time or cyclic interval requirement.\\n l. Probability of Detection (POD). POD is a quantitative statistical measure of the capability \\nto detect a particular type of anomaly (flaw) over a range of sizes using a specific NDI technique under specific conditions.\\n m. Safety Critical Parts. Safety critical parts are those parts of an engine whose failure is \\nlikely to directly present a CAAM level 3 or 4 hazard to the aircraft.\\n n. Uncontained Failure. Uncontained failure is the uncontained release of debris caused by \\nthe malfunction of an engine component (blade, disk, spacer, impeller, drum/spool, pressure vessel). In order to be categorized as uncontained for the purposes of this AC, the debris must pass completely through the nacelle. Parts or fragments that puncture the nacelle skin but do not escape or pass completely through are not considered “uncontained.” Parts or fragments \\nthat pass out of the inlet or exhaust opening without passing through any structure are also not considered “uncontained.” \\n5. BACKGROUND. Analysis of fifteen years of transport aircraft accident and incident data \\nshows that the leading cause of engine related CAAM level 3 and 4 accidents for turbofan \\nengines is the uncontained failure of safety critical parts. The failure of safety critical parts can present a significant hazard to an aircraft by releasing fragments that can penetrate the cabin or fuel tanks, damage control surfaces, or sever flammable fluid or hydraulic lines. To significantly reduce the occurrence of these incidents, part features most critical to safety should be subjected to in-service inspections at each piece-part opportunity during their service lives, using methods that detect flaws that could lead to failure. \\nPar 4 Page 3\\nAC 33.4-2 3/8/01\\n \\na. In daily operation, many engine parts are exposed to high thermal and mechanical loads. \\nAs a result of these loads, cracks can form. If these cracks are not detected, they can grow \\nand lead to part failure. Cracks can also form for many other reasons, including the following:\\n (1) Material impurities.\\n         (2)  Machining during manufacture or repair.\\n         (3)  Unexpected stress levels due to part design or operation.         (4)  Unanticipated operating conditions.         (5)  Foreign object damage.         (6)  Handling damage during overhaul or repair.         (7)  Corrosion.\\n b. As part of the certification plan, the applicant should identify the safety critical parts likely \\nto result in a CAAM level 3 or 4 event if they fail. When these parts and their associated \\ninspection instructions are included in the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the ICA required by §33.4, the inspections become mandatory operational restrictions.\\n c. The incorporation of damage tolerance design methods acceptable to the Administrator \\nenables a TC holder or applicant to evaluate the vulnerability of a safety critical part to anomaly threats. Therefore, TC holders who have designed or assessed safety critical parts using a damage tolerance design methodology may establish in-service inspections based on the part’s damage tolerance characteristics and analyses. \\n6. CRITICAL PARTS AND FEATURES IDENTIFICATION . Effective in-service \\ninspections include identification of the safety critical parts, the most critical features, and the \\ninspection processes that reliably detect flaws in these features. Each applicant should conduct an assessment to establish which parts and part features are candidates for in-service inspection.\\n a. Selection of Parts. The primary consideration for the selection of safety critical parts \\nrequiring in-service inspection is the consequence of failure of the part. Parts whose failure is likely to result in a CAAM level 3 or 4 event, regardless of the probability of occurrence, should be subject to in-service inspection. \\nPage 4 Par 5\\n3/8/01 AC 33.4-2\\n \\n         (1)  Methods for identifying safety critical parts should incorporate the following:\\n              (a)  Service experience of similar parts.              (b)  Kinetic energy analyses of the part at operational levels.              (c)  Characteristics of the surrounding containment structure.         (2)  Safety critical parts should include: fan disks and hubs, high pressure turbine (HPT) \\ndisks, low pressure turbine (LPT) disks, high pressure compressor disks and drum rotors. The list may also include parts on large engines, such as cooling plates, shafts and spacers, due to their mass.\\n         (3)  If there is insufficient field experience to accurately determine the likelihood and \\nconsequence of failure, design configurations should be qualitatively evaluated using the most relevant field experience and the safety assessment conducted for certification. The qualitative assessment should include, but is not limited to, the following factors:\\n              (a)  Stress and temperature level relative to material capability.              (b)  Crack growth rate.              (c)  Crack path and the most critical fracture pattern.              (d)  Kinetic energy of fragments of similar components that had previous CAAM level \\n3 and 4 events.\\n              (e)  Potential crack and damage types.\\n b. Feature Identification . Once the list of safety critical parts has been established, a \\nhistorical review of the features that have caused the failure of similar parts should be \\nconducted.\\n        (1)  This feature review should incorporate the following factors:              (a)  Failure history.              (b)  Failure root causes.              (c)  Feature history.              (d)  Susceptibility to handling and foreign object damage. \\nPar 6 Page 5\\nAC 33.4-2 3/8/01\\n \\n              (e)  Susceptibility to material impurities.\\n              (f )  Susceptibility to corrosion, fatigue, and creep.\\n         (2)  CAAM and mature TC holder databases have been considered acceptable for this \\nreview. The design characteristics of the part should be considered when evaluating features.\\n         (3)  When evaluating a feature for in-service inspection, the following characteristics \\nshould be included as appropriate:\\n              (a)  High stress.              (b)  Residual stress (compressive or tensile).              (c)  Peening effects on crack detection and growth rate.              (d)  Residual life.              (e)  Material characteristics.              (f )  New or novel materials.\\n              (g )  Manufacturing and repair processes.\\n              (h )  Severity of operating environment (temperature, speed, corrosion, etc.).\\n              (i )  Cleaning requirements.\\n         (4)  An applicant may conduct fracture mechanics analyses to support the identification of \\nthe most critical part features. \\n7. INSPECTION METHODS. FPI and ECI are acceptable methods, but not the only \\nmethods, for crack detection. Whether FPI, ECI or another method is used, the prescribed \\ninspection method should have a demonstrated reliability of detecting cracks on the targeted part feature and a well-developed process that minimizes variation and maximizes detection sensitivity and reliability.\\n a. FPI is the most widely used inspection method for detecting surface flaws in turbine \\nengine parts. Many safety critical parts currently receive global or full field FPI inspections periodically. However, parts with poor line-of-sight features, surfaces with high residual compressive stress, rough surface finishes, complex feature details, or parts that are hard to clean are not usually appropriate candidates for FPI. \\nPage 6 Par 6\\n3/8/01 AC 33.4-2\\n \\nb. To raise crack detection capabilities to a higher level, other inspection techniques, such as \\nECI, should be considered for those features for which FPI is not considered appropriate. \\nTypically, ECI is appropriate for disk bores, high length to diameter (L/D) ratio holes, dovetail slots, and other highly stressed features. Considerations in selecting an inspection method include, but are not limited to, desired process sensitivity and reliability, accessibility, part condition, feature geometry and POD. \\n8. FREQUENCY OF INSPECTIONS. To maximize the likelihood of crack detection, in-\\nservice inspections should be conducted at each piece-part opportunity, regardless of which \\ninspection method is chosen. The TC holder should determine at which disassembly level the part would be sufficiently disassembled to allow for meaningful inspection. Parts that are configured with riveted, pressed-on, or otherwise attached hardware whose removal is likely to expose the part to additional damage should not necessarily be further disassembled to accommodate focused inspection. \\n9. ENGINE INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONTINUED AIRWORTHINESS (ICA).\\n a. The engine manual ICA should contain language to include the in-service inspections. \\nThe ALS of the ICA should incorporate the following factors:         (1)  Definition of “piece-part” or other appropriate disassembly level.         (2)  Identification of the parts requiring in-service inspection.         (3)  Location of the inspection instruction details.         (4)  Specification of when the inspection is required.\\n b. TC holder ICAs are not standardized in the description of the ALS; titles such as \\n“Chapter 5,” “Time Limits Section,” or “Lifing Service Bulletins” are used. Engines with a \\ncertification basis prior to Amendment 9 of part 33 are subject to the establishment of limitations in accordance with §33.5, Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine, which does not require a separate ALS. Engines with a certification basis of part 33 Amendment 9 and later are subject to the requirements of §33.4, Instructions for Continued Airworthiness, which does require a separate ALS.\\n c. The step-by-step instructions for the actual inspections should be placed in the \\nappropriate engine overhaul manual section or other readily accessible shop document. \\nPar 7 Page 7\\n AC 33.4-2 3/8/01\\n \\nd. The following, or similar language, should be included in the ALS or Chapter 5 of the \\nengine manual to assure that the in-service inspections are incorporated into the operator’s \\ncontinuous airworthiness maintenance plans: \\nAIRWORTHINESS LIMITATIONS\\n MANDATORY INSPECTIONS\\n \\n1. Perform inspections of the following parts at each piece-part opportunity in \\naccordance with the instructions provided in the applicable manual chapter(s): \\nPart Nomenclature Part Number \\n(P/N) Inspect per Applicable Manual Chapter \\nFan Disk All 72-31-xx-xxx, Fluorescent Penetrant \\nInspection and 72-31-xx-xxx, Eddy Current Inspection \\nHPT Rotor Interstage Seal All 72-53-xx-xxx, Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection \\n2. For the purposes of these mandatory inspections, piece-part opportunity means:\\n a. The part is considered completely disassembled in accordance with the \\ndisassembly instructions in the engine manufacturer’s maintenance manual; and\\n b. The part has accumulated more than 100 cycles in service since the last in-\\nservice inspection, provided that the part was not damaged or related to the cause for its removal from the engine.\\n e. Applicants should submit the in-service inspection ICA to the Aircraft Certification Office \\n(ACO) responsible for overseeing that type certification project for acceptance. The ACO and an Aircraft Evaluation Group (AEG) will jointly determine the acceptability of the ICA. The AEG will review the in-service inspection ICA and make recommendations on the maintenance and operational aspects. The ACO will determine final acceptance of the completed ICA. The in-service inspection instructions may be incomplete at type certification if a program exists to ensure its completion either:\\n         (1)  Prior to delivery of the first aircraft with the engine installed; or         (2)  Upon issuance of a standard certificate of airworthiness for the aircraft with the engine \\ninstalled, whichever occurs later. \\nPage 8 Par 9\\n3/8/01 AC 33.4-2\\n \\nf. Supplemental type certificates (STCs) or parts manufacturer approvals (PMAs) that \\nincorporate safety critical parts should contain in-service inspection ICA as part of the design \\napproval. The STC or PMA applicant is responsible for producing, distributing and maintaining the required in-service inspection ICA. \\n10. RECORD KEEPING . Any person who performs the in-service inspection on a \\ncomponent or part should make an entry in the maintenance record of that component or part \\nafter inspection. Operators may incorporate the records of these inspections into existing maintenance record keeping systems.\\n /s/ \\nJay J.

INTRODUCTION CHAPTER 1\\n Purpose.  1.1\\nThis AC provides guidance to demonstrate  compliance with Title  14 of the Code of \\nFederal Regulations (14 CFR) Section 33.90, Initial  Maintenance Inspection Test . \\n Change or Cancellation Statement.  1.2\\n Change.  1.2.1\\nNot Applicable.  \\n Cancellation.  1.2.2\\nAC 33.90- 1, Initial Maintenance Inspection (IMI), 14 CFR 33.90, Test for Turbine \\nEngi nes, dated March 05, 2004, is cancelled.  \\n Applicability.  1.3\\n Audience.  1.3.1\\nThis AC is directed to engine manufacturers, modifiers, and Federal Aviation \\nAdministration (FAA) engine type certification designees.  \\n Compliance Methods. 1.3.2\\nThis AC describes an acceptable means, but not the only means, to make a regulatory showing of compliance. If you (the applicant) use the means described in the AC, you must follow it in all respects. Terms such as “should,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance \\nwhen the method of compliance in this AC is used. \\nIf you use a different means, we (the FAA) will evaluate what you provide to \\ndetermine if you have demonstrated regulatory com pliance. We will consider your \\nproposed method(s) and what you present to show that your alternate method demonstrates compliance. If we determine you have demonstrated compliance to the regulation, we will accept your alternate method.  \\nWe are not bound by  this AC if we find that following it will not result in compliance \\nwith the regulations. Also, we may require additional testing before we conclude you have shown compliance, even if you are using the means described in this AC. \\n Regulatory Impact.  1.3.3\\nThis AC  is not mandatory and it does not constitute a regulation. While not \\nmandatory, the guidance in this AC is derived from FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the applicable regulations.  \\nThis AC does not change, authorize changes to, or  permit deviations from, existing \\nregulatory requirements. This AC also does not create any additional regulatory requirements.  \\n  \\n 1-1 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n  \\n Suggestions for Improvement.  1.4\\nUse the advisory circular feedback form in APPENDIX A of this AC  to: \\n• Suggest improvements or changes. \\n• Request clarification.  \\n• Report deficiencies.  \\n Related Reference Material . 1.5\\n Regulations. 1.5.1\\nTable 1-1 lists regulations that apply to this AC. \\nTable 1-1.

GUIDANCE  CHAPTER 2\\n Initial Maintenance Inspe ction (IMI) Tests.  2.1\\n IMI Test Cycle Assessment.  2.1.1\\n2.1.1.1 General.  \\nYou should provide an assessment of expected service operating conditions \\nas part of the test plan. In your assessment, you should show that the proposed test cycle represents expected in -service engine flight cycle usage , \\nincluding the following : \\n• Establis hed power/thrust ratings . \\n• Reverse thrust use . \\n• Component stress and temperature . \\n• Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) . \\n• Vibration . \\n• Cycle/operating time cumulative damage . \\n• Other critical factors.  \\nFor multiple aircraft applications, you should show that the test cycle adequately represents all identified or anticipated installations and engine \\nflight cycles.   \\nTest cycles  that have been used in the past to demonstrate IMI interval(s) \\ninclude:  \\n• Full cycle  (paragraph 2.1.1.2 of this AC ).  \\n• Accelerated severity cycle (paragraph 2.1.1.3 of this AC ). \\n• Combinations of the above test cycle types . \\nIf the test plan combin es the IMI test with the § 33.201 early extended \\noperations (ETOPS) test, you must successfully complete the ea rly ETOPS \\ntest prior to EIS. See paragraph  2.1.7 of this AC.  \\n2.1.1.2 Full Cycle Test.  \\nThe full cycle test requires that you run the engine through the exact thrust \\nor power  setting  sequences  for the time period identified in the engine flight \\ncycle.  One complete cycle of a full cycle test  includes : \\n• A typical engine flight cycle .  \\n• The exact number of operating hours, from engine start through \\ncomplete shutdown. \\n 2-1 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n  \\n2.1.1.3 Accelerated S everity Cycle Test.  \\nThe accelerated severity cycle test  provide s a rigorous test of engines (or \\nengine parts) whose durability is primarily affected by cyclic operation.  This \\ntype of test allows you to  vary  from the engine flight cycle the following \\ncondit ions: \\n• Time at various thrust or power settings . \\n• Sequence of thrust or power selections .  \\nTo determine the relationship between the accelerated severity cycle test and \\nthe full flight cycle , you must perform a complex analysis of : \\n• Stress. \\n• Temperature.  \\n• Resulting life of each affected part of the engine.   \\nThe accelerated severity cycle test may include the equivalent of several flight cycles during a given portion of  the overall engine test . This can result \\nin a small number of engine hours in comparison t o the number of engine \\nflight cycles demonstrated.  \\nThe accelerated severity cycle test is generally not considered ideal for engine parts whose durability is primarily affected by hours of operation rather than by cycles.  For those cases, IMI interval subs tantiation may \\nrequire other test or service experience data (including , if available , \\ncomparison of relevant past IMI demonstrations to successful entry -into-\\nservice engine experience) .  \\nThe accelerated severity cycle test  you choose  should include engine start \\nand shutdown. \\n IMI Test Engine Configuration. 2.1.2\\n2.1.2.1 General.  \\nCompliance with Section 33.90 specifies  that you demonstrate the test with \\nan engine that substantially conforms to its final type design.  Note the \\nfollowing:  \\n• Engine modific ation  should not be required to complete the IMI test .  \\n• If significant engine type design changes are expected, you should not \\nperform the IMI test . \\n  \\n 2-2 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n  \\n2.1.2.2 Consideration of Hardware Items Not Part of Engine Type Design.  \\nYou should consider for test  inclusion other hardware items not normally \\npart of the engine type design (for example, thrust reverser, air starter, \\nengine build- up hardware ). Including such hardware may : \\n• Produce more realistic engine loads . \\n• Increase test time for the non -engine components.  \\nConsult the aircraft manufacturer f or information on this hardware or \\ninstallation configuration.  \\n2.1.2.3 Engine Test  Configuration. \\nYou should conduct  the IMI test when the engine is  installed in a typical \\nconfiguration, to the maximum extent possible . For example, you should:  \\n• Connect and operate, in a way representative of service, airframe \\naccessories and interfaces that load the engine . \\n• Schedule, throughout the test, t ypical accessory loads and bleed air \\nextraction that would be experienced during the engine flight cycle.  \\n2.1.2.4 Turboprop Applications.  \\nFor turboprop applications, perform  the test run with a n installation -eligible  \\npropeller installed.  Incorporate  into the test cycle  applicable design features, \\nsuch as : \\n• Propeller braking . \\n• Auxiliary power unit (APU) -mode operation(s).  \\n2.1.2.5 Turboshaft Applications.  \\nFor turboshaft applications, you should load the test engine output shaft to \\nsimulate the appropriate rotor drive system characteristics of the intended \\ninstallation.  Potential rotor drive system characteristics include, but are not \\nlimited to, inertial and torsional vibration.  \\n Test Parameters.  2.1.3\\nYou may conduct the  test at standard day conditions , if th ose conditions effectively \\nrepresent  the conditions expected during an engine flight cycle, including:  \\n• Power/thrus t. \\n• Stress. \\n• Component temperature . \\n• EGT . \\n• Unbalance vibration.  \\n 2-3 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n  \\n Test Duration.  2.1.4\\nThe total number of test cycles and test duration should be equivalent to the \\nanticipated initial on- wing life for the new engine model in a typical installation.  At a \\nminimum, you will need to : \\n• Run a suitable number of cycles to es tablish the IMI interval(s).  \\n• Demonstrate  that a type design engine remains in a serviceable condition between \\nrequired maintenance inspections.  \\nThe regulation does not require a fixed number of cycles  (i.e., the IMI is not a \\n\"1,000- cycle\" test ). However, y ou must correlate the number of cycles you propose for \\nthe test to the planned engine inspection intervals.  See paragraph 2.1.6 of this AC.  \\n Pass/Fail Criteria.  2.1.5\\n2.1.5.1 General.  \\nThe engine type design will meet  the requirements of § 33.90 when the \\npost-test, IMI hardware condition demonstrate s that the engine will remain \\nairwo rthy for the proposed intervals. The engine should comply with \\nparagraph  2.1.5.2, paragraph 2.1.5.3, and paragraph  2.1.5.4 of this AC . \\n2.1.5.2 Test Duration.  \\nOver the test duration, and when you follow normal ICA maintenance \\npractices, the engine must : \\n• Meet all proposed thrust or power ratings without exceeding any \\noperating limitations.   \\n• Be free of significant anomalies (for example, surge, stall ) when \\noperated per the operating instructions provided in support of § 33.5. \\n2.1.5.3 Post-Teardown Inspection. \\nA post -test teardown inspection should demonstrate  that each engine part : \\n• Conforms to the type design.  \\n• Is eligible for continued operation in service.  \\nYou may find hardware serviceable if you include , within the ICA , \\nappropriate inspections or limitations.  \\n  \\n 2-4 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n  \\n2.1.5.4 Certification Documentation.  \\nThe certification documentation should identify those parts of the e ngine \\nthat will have specific ICA requirements or recommendations that result \\nfrom the IMI test. The final ICA should include these specific requirements \\nand or recommendations , per the existing provisions of § 33.4, including : \\n• Life limits .  \\n• Inspections . \\n• Intervals .  \\n• Accept/reject criteria.  \\n Determination of Time/Cycle IMI Intervals.  2.1.6\\n2.1.6.1 Full Cycle Test.  \\nFor a successful full cycle test, you may use the full number of cycles and full number of hours demonstrated during the test as the IMI interval. \\n2.1.6.2 Accelerated Severity Cycle Test.  \\nFor a successful accelerated severity cycle test, you may use the full number of cycles for those engine parts for which the test cycle was shown to be equal to or more severe than the assumed engine flight cycle.  \\n2.1.6.3 High Thrust Settings du ring Selected Test Cycle.  \\nThe test cycle you use  (for example, accelerated severity cycle) may involve \\nhigh thrust setting  operation  for durations that significantly exceed  those of \\nthe engine flight cycle . If so, we may accept a field inspection interval \\nlonger than the IMI test  length . This approach requires caution , because:  \\n• Some engine parts will wear as a function of time at load, rather than \\nfrom low -cycle fatigue.  \\n• Life extrapolation based on material property data alone is imprecise, \\nat best.   \\nUnder these circumstances, you may need to draw supporting evidence from other : \\n• Engine  tests.  \\n• Component tests.  \\n• Subassembly tests.  \\n  \\n 2-5 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n  \\n Using the Early ETOPS Test of § 33.201 to Demonstrate IMI Compliance. 2.1.7\\n2.1.7.1 General.  \\nSection 33.90(b) allows you to use an approved test conducted per § 33.201, \\nin lieu of a separate IMI test.  Use of  the Early ETOPs test  allows you to \\ndemonstrate compliance with both regulations through a single test on one engine.  \\nIf you use this method , the following conditions apply : \\n1. After you complete the full number of test cycles required for an IMI \\ntest performed per § 33.90(a), you must interrupt the § 33.201 test to \\nconduct a complete on- wing ( or other ) inspection. Note the following:  \\na. The inspectio n must be  acceptable to us , the FAA,  in order to \\ndemonstrate  compliance with § 33.90 requirements.  \\nb. An acceptable on -wing inspection must include, but is not limited \\nto, the inspections and tests listed in paragraph 2.1.7.2 of this AC. \\n2. Prior to EIS, y ou must complete the § 33.201 test in its entirety . This \\nwill provide further evidence that no undiscovered engine fault exists  \\nduring the IMI portion of the test.  \\n3. If the IMI inspection is completed and the TC is issued, you must \\ncomplete the remaining portion of the § 33.201 test in order to comply with §  33.90(b) requirements. \\n4. FAA r eview of the general pass/fail criteria defined in paragraph 2.1.5 \\nof this AC must demonstrate  that the engine is fully serviceable per the \\nICAs, unless otherwise accepted by us.  \\n2.1.7.2 On-Wing Inspection. \\n2.1.7.2.1 Borescope  Inspection.  \\nFull borescope -inspect  all accessible gas path stages or areas of the fan, \\ncompressor, combustor, and turbine modules, to the serviceable limits of the ICAs.  \\n2.1.7.2.2 System Fault and Status Message Interrogation.  \\nEvaluate all system fault and status messages, for electronic -control -\\nequipped engines. Include both current and previously recorded messages, to the serviceable limits of the ICAs . \\n2.1.7.2.3 Oil System Chip Detector and Filter Inspection.  \\nInspect all oil system chip detectors and filters for contaminan ts. \\n2.1.7.2.4 Fuel System Filter Inspection.  \\nInspect all fuel system filters for contaminants . \\n 2-6 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n  \\n2.1.7.2.5 Main Engine Oil Sample Test.  \\nTest the engine oil (for example, spectrographic analysis) for contaminants \\nthat might indicate impending internal failure . \\n2.1.7.2.6 Visual Inspection.  \\nPerform a complete visual inspection of the inlet, exhaust, and externals, to the serviceable limits of the ICAs . The engine must be serviceable.  \\n2.1.7.2.7 Power Calibration. \\nDemonstrate  that the engine can produce rated power or thrust at a sea -level, \\nhot-day corner point condition within approved limits . \\n Fixed Engine Overhaul Period.  2.2\\nYou may recommend a fixed overhaul period as the equivalent of an IMI , i f you do \\nnot intend to cover the engine with  a structured inspection program . If you use this \\napproach, you should:  \\n• Conduct the engine test under § 33.90 in a similar manner to that described in \\nparagraph  1.7 of this AC.  \\n• Determine if the test results support the desir ed fixed overhaul period.  \\n 2-7 \\n04/13/2016    AC 33.90- 1A \\n   Appendix A   \\n \\nAPPENDIX A .

Purpose .  This advisory circular (AC) provides information and guidance on turbine engine \\ncompliance under part 33 of Title 14 of the Code  of Federal Regulations (14 CFR), specifically \\n§§ 33.7, Engine ratings and operati ng limitations, and 33.8, Selection of engine power and thrust \\nratings.  This AC also provides information on preparing the data needed for the type \\ncertification data sheet (TCDS)  specified in § 33.7(a).  \\n \\n2.  Applicability.  \\n \\n     a.  The guidance provided in this document is directed to applicants requesting certification of \\nturbine engines, except that no sp ecific guidance is provided for the augmented power or thrust \\n(refer to § 33.7, paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (iii)) and supersonic engine s.  For the purpose of this \\nAC, any reference to power or thrust is for unaugmented power  or thrust (refer to § 33.7, \\nparagraphs (c)(1)(ii) and (iv)). \\n \\n     b.  This material is neither mandatory nor  regulatory in nature a nd does not constitute a \\nregulation.  It describes acceptable means, but not  the only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations.  The FAA w ill consider other methods of demonstrating \\ncompliance that an applicant may elect to present.   Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and \\n“must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of \\ncompliance when the acceptable method of complia nce in this document is used.  While these \\nguidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in \\ndetermining compliance with the relevant regulations.  On the other hand, if the FAA becomes \\naware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as  the basis for finding compliance. \\n \\n     c.  This material does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or permit deviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\n3.

Background. \\n \\n     a.  When pursuing a type certificate (TC), the applicant selects the engine ratings (refer to \\n§§ 33.7 and 33.8) and associated operating limitations  (refer to § 33.7).  Each rated power or \\nthrust is defined in the definitions of 14 CFR part 1 (§ 1.1) and is associated with engine \\noperating limitations related to shaft torque, ro tor speeds, and gas temperatures (refer to \\n§ 33.7(c)).  These ratings and limitations are th en applied to show co mpliance with part 33 \\nregulations, some of which are engine tests.  At the conclusion of part 33 compliance, the applicant may find the operating limitations have been validated or need to be modified or \\nadditional limitations may be necessary.  Th e FAA then approves the engine ratings and \\nlimitations based on demonstrated compliance with  the airworthiness st andards of part 33.  \\n \\n     b.  The engine rated power or thrust is part  of the engine identification data (refer to 14 CFR \\n45.13, paragraph (a)(6)).  It is identified in the TC DS, which is part of the TC (refer to 14 CFR \\n21.41), and marked on the engine data plate (refer to § § 45.11(a) and 45.13(a)).  \\n \\n5.  TCDS - §  33.7(a) . \\n \\n     a.  The TCDS documents the engine ra ted power or thrust and the associated operating \\nlimitations for which compliance with the airworth iness standards in part  33 was demonstrated.  \\nThe applicant must provide the information for inclusion in the TCDS, specifically the ratings \\nand associated limitations addressed in paragrap hs 6 through 22 of this AC, and any additional \\nlimitations established during showing of complian ce with part 33.  Some data, such as complex \\nor lengthy data, may be included in the TCDS by reference to other approved documentation, \\nsuch as installation or operation manuals. \\n \\n     b.  Along with the ratings and operating lim itations required in § 33.7, the TCDS must also \\nidentify any rating limitation in the definitions of § 1.1.  For example, identify time limits, the \\nnumber of occurrences, or insp ection requirements when these limitations are listed in the \\ndefinitions of § 1.1.  For each certified engine, the applicable definitions for the ratings are those \\neffective or associated with part 33 amendments in the certification basis.  Since rating  \\n \\n \\n 2\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\ndefinitions in § 1.1 have changed several times ove r past decades, the current definitions may not \\napply to previously certified engines.  For ex ample, part 33 amendment 25 effective October 17, \\n2008, revised the definition for rated 2½ -minute one engine inoperative (OEI) power.  That \\nrevision removed the restriction for a “period of use” and allowed “periods of use” of this rating \\nduring a single flight.  Engines certified before this amendment are restricted to a single period \\nof use of the rated 2½ -minute OEI power within one flight; engines certified to this amendment \\nmay use 2½ -minute OEI power more than once within one flight.  \\n \\n     c.  The TCDS is prepared in partnershi p with the applicant and i ssued by the certificate \\nmanagement aircraft certificati on office (CMACO).  This is the ACO that manages the original \\ntype certificate projec t and maintains and updates the documen t as long as the engine is in \\nservice.  The TCDS must be re vised to include subsequent ame nded TC models or any changes \\nto the ratings and operating limitations approved by the FAA.  \\n \\n     d.  The TCDS may document other information resulting from part 33 compliance, and may \\ngo beyond the compliance with § 33.7.  This AC only addresses the TCDS information related to engine ratings and operating limitations.  On the other hand, the TCDS is not the only certification document that identifies the ratings  and operating limitations.  For example, the \\napplicant must identify the ratings and operati ng limitations in the installation and operating \\ninstructions required under § 33.5.  Since this AC only addresses compliance with §§ 33.7 and \\n33.8, annotations of manuals are not discussed here. \\n \\n6.  Engine Ratings - General . \\n \\n     a.  Engine ratings are established by power for turboshaft and turbopropeller engine \\napplications, and by thrust for turbojet and turbof an engine applications.  The ratings are defined \\nin § 1.1 and they are either c ontinuous or limited to specific time durations.  The applicant \\nselects the ratings from those listed in § 33.7, para graphs (c)(1)(i) through (x).  Of these, the \\ntakeoff and maximum continuous ratings are manda tory, while the OEI ratings for rotorcraft \\nengines are not mandatory.  The OEI ratings are selected by the applicant to support rotorcraft \\noperating requirements.  The applicant should estab lish the rated power or thrust by engine test \\nand for the conditions specified by the definition for that rating in § 1.1.  All engine ratings must \\nbe declared in the TCDS. \\n \\n     b.  When a rating other than those listed in  § 33.7, paragraphs (c)(1) (i) through (x) is desired, \\nthe applicant may request that ra ting in a special condition (refer to § 21.16).  For example, the \\nFAA issued special condition SC No. 33-005-SC fo r “rated 30-minute power,” a new rating for \\nrotorcraft engines.  In part 33, the only non-OEI ratings available for rotorcraft engines were the \\nrated takeoff power limited in use to periods of 5 minutes and the rated maximum continuous \\npower.  The rated 30-minute power provided a power level greater than maximum continuous \\npower for use up to 30 minutes.  The rating was re quested by the applicant to provide the power \\nneeded for the rotorcraft to hover for extended pe riods of time during search and rescue flight  \\n \\n 3\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\nmissions.  The rated 30-minute power was a novel and unusual engine rating, so the FAA issued \\na special condition.   \\n \\n     c.  For each selected e ngine rating, the applicant must esta blish limits for the power or thrust, \\nshaft torque, engine rotational speed, and gas te mperature as specified in § 33.7(c)(1).  In \\naddition, for each rating the applicant must establ ish limits for the operating parameters specified \\nin § 33.7, paragraphs (c)(2) th rough (c)(18), as applicable, an d any other limitations found \\nnecessary for safe operation for the engine as specified in § 33.7(a).  The applicant should \\nsubstantiate the operating limitations associated with each rating when sh owing compliance with \\npart 33.  \\n \\n     d.  The applicant must establish the power  or thrust for each rating at the minimum value \\nexpected from all manufactured engines of the same model (see additiona l guidance in paragraph \\n23.b. of this AC).  \\n \\n     e.  For amending existing TCs, applicants mu st consider that earlier certifications were based \\non rating definitions available at that time.  The definitions have changed since the earlier part 33 \\namendments, or the preceding Civil Aviation Re gulation (CAR) 13.  When amending a TC to the \\ncurrent or later part 33 amendments, the a pplicant should examine the changes in rating \\ndefinitions and regulatory requirements.  To better understand these changes, the history since \\nCAR 13 is provided in appendix 2 of this AC.  \\n \\n     f.  For each rated power or thrust, the applicant must identify a nd list in the TCDS the \\ncorresponding engine configuration and engine running conditions used to demonstrate that \\npower or thrust.  The rated takeoff power and th rust must be defined at standard sea level \\nconditions, the rated maximum continuous power and thrust at applicant sp ecified altitudes and \\nstandard atmosphere, and the power for all OEI ratings at applicant specified altitudes and \\ntemperatures (refer to § 1.1).  All rated power an d thrust must be defined for static conditions, \\nexcept the maximum continuous power and thrust may be defined for either static or in-flight conditions.  The engine c onfiguration must include the status of  load extraction (accessory loads) \\nand air extraction (bleed air), inlet and exhaust configurations, and any f acility or installation \\nconfigurations affecting the engi ne performance.  See appendix 1 of this AC for an example of \\nengine configuration annotation in the TCDS. \\n \\n7.  Rated Takeoff Power or Thrust (unaugmented) - §  33.7(c)(1)(iv) . \\n \\n     a.  For each type certificated engine, the applicant must establish the power or thrust \\nassociated with the takeoff rating that can be ach ieved at static standard  sea level conditions and \\nwithin the engine operating limitations establis hed under part 33.  The applicant must then \\ndemonstrate the rated takeoff power or thrust by engine test.  When the engine test ambient \\nconditions are different from the standard atmosphe re at sea level, the ap plicant must apply the \\nappropriate corrections.  The rated takeoff power or thrust is limite d in use to periods of not over \\n5 minutes for takeoff operations (refer to § 1.1).  \\n 4\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\n     b.  The FAA often found the “rated takeo ff power” or “rated takeoff thrust” required under \\n§ 33.7(c)(1)(iv) is incorre ctly exchanged for “takeoff power” or “takeoff thrust” as defined in \\n§ 1.1.  The rated takeoff power and thrust were  first adopted under part s 1 and 33, amendment 3 \\nin 1967.  Prior to this amendment, the only ava ilable definitions were for “takeoff power” and \\n“takeoff thrust,” applicable to both engine and aircraft certifications.  The preamble to \\namendment 3 notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) provides the rationale for introducing the \\n“rated takeoff power” and “rated takeoff thrust” and states this rating is for engine type certification under part 33, while  the “takeoff power” and “takeoff thrust” are intended for \\naircraft certification only .  The NPRM further states that approved power or thrust for takeoff are \\nratings for engines and operating limitations for aircraft.  Therefore, only the “rated takeoff \\npower” and “rated takeoff thrust” are ratings  approved under § 33.7; the “takeoff power” and \\n“takeoff thrust” are not engine ratings under § 33.7.  See appendix 2 of this AC for the \\nchronological revisions of takeoff rating definitions.  \\n \\n     c.  When requested by the applicant, the FAA may approve extension of the time limit for the \\nrated takeoff power or thrust from 5 minutes to  10 minutes for an airplane operation when one \\nengine becomes inoperative during takeoff.  The FAA issued two policy memoranda addressing the extended use of the rated takeoff power or th rust for turbine engines installed on airplanes \\ncertificated under parts 23 and 25 (see paragraphs 3.a. and 3.b. of this AC).  The FAA \\ndetermined the 5 minute limit for rated takeoff pow er or thrust in § 1.1 applies to routine or \\nnormal takeoff operations, and this time limit may be extended for abnormal OEI takeoff operations.  \\n \\n         (1)  At the time of engine TC applic ation, the applicant must reque st the time extension and \\ninclude this feature in the certification plan.  Specifically, the applicant must make a written \\nrequest for each engine model to the engi ne CMACO.  Only tu rbojet, turbofan, and \\nturbopropeller engines are eligib le, while turboshaft and recipr ocating engines are not.  The \\nmethods to obtain approval are contained in the policy memoranda referenced in paragraphs 3.a. \\nand 3.b. of this AC.   \\n \\n         (2)  The time extension is limited to the following:  \\n \\n              (a)  Engine operation at rate d takeoff power or thrust for periods not to exceed 10 \\nminutes during takeoff.  That is an extension of  up to 5 minutes to the normal 5 minute takeoff \\ntime limit. \\n \\n              (b)  In the event one engine becomes inoperative during takeoff. \\n \\n         (3)  The applicant must include in their substantiati on plans the extension of the rated \\ntakeoff power or thrust to 10 minutes, and reference the applicable FAA policy.  The engine \\nTCDS (and engine manuals) must  contain the following note: \\n \\n \\n 5\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\n“The rated takeoff power (or thrust) may be used  for up to 10 minutes in the event one engine on \\na multi-engine airplane becomes inoperative duri ng takeoff, with the following limitations: [list \\nlimitations, if any]”. \\n \\n         (4)  See appendix 1 of this  AC for an example of TCDS annotation.  \\n \\n     d.  The rated takeoff power or thrust correc ted to the conditions specified in the TCDS must \\nbe achievable at any time; othe rwise the engine does not comp ly with its type design.  In \\naddition, the applicant must ensure the rated power  or thrust can be reached by a simple power \\nlever move or its equivalent.  De sign configurations that limit the takeoff power or thrust to less \\nthan its rated value are not acceptable.  Any engi ne installer who wants to  limit the engine power \\nor thrust to less than the rated takeoff values, also known as “derated takeoff power or thrust,” \\nmay request FAA approval under the aircraft certification and in accordance with the aircraft \\nregulations.  Alternately, the a pplicant may request FAA approval for a change in engine design \\nand designate a new model for the lower rated ta keoff power or thrust.  See paragraph 23.b. of \\nthis AC for additional guidance. \\n \\n8.  Rated Maximum Continuous Pow er or Thrust (unaugmented) - §  33.7(c)(1)(ii) .   \\n \\n     a.  For each type certificated engine, the applicant must determine the value for the rated \\nmaximum continuous power or thrust.  The appli cant must demonstrate by engine test that the \\nrated maximum continuous power or thrust is achieved without exceeding the operating \\nlimitations established in compliance with pa rt 33 and required in § 33.7(c).  The ambient \\nconditions for which the engine must produce the rated maximum continuous power or thrust are \\nspecified in § 1.1.   \\n \\n     b.  The rated maximum continuous power or th rust corrected to the co nditions specified in the \\nTCDS must be achievable at a ny time; otherwise the engine does not comply with its type \\ndesign.  In addition, the applicant must ensure the rated power or thrust can be reached by a \\nsimple power lever movement or its equivalent.  Design configurations that limit the maximum \\ncontinuous power or thrust to less than  its rated value are not acceptable.   \\n \\n9.  Rotorcraft Engine OEI Ratings .  \\n \\n     a.  OEI ratings for rotorcraft engines (turboshafts) are non-mandatory ratings.  They are \\nselected by applicants from those available in § 33.7, paragraphs (c)(1)(v) through (ix) based on \\nrotorcraft design needs.  Once selected, the a pplicant must follow the associated part 33 \\nrequirements for each rating.  The requirement s in part 33 for 30-second and 2-minute OEI \\nratings are significantly different  from all other OEI ratings, in cluding 2½-minute OEI.  For \\nexample, inspection and maintenance actions ar e required at the end of each flight when 30-\\nsecond OEI power or 2-minute OEI power are used, while there is no such requirement for any  \\n \\n \\n 6\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\nother OEI ratings.  Refer to the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings definitions in § 1.1 and \\nspecific requirements in pa rt 33, including appendix A33.4. \\n \\n     b.  In an OEI event, the highest engine power  available for continuation of flight is the highest \\nOEI rated power for that engine.  For example,  subsequent to a rotorcraft OEI event, the \\noperating engine having 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings may use the 30-second OEI power \\nto attain a safe altitude followed by the 2-mi nute OEI power to continue into a climb-out.  \\nThereafter, the engine may use the next availa ble rated power that, de pending on the engine \\nrating structure, could be 30-minute OEI follo wed by continuous OEI power, or 30-minute OEI \\nfollowed by maximum continuous power.   \\n \\n     c.  The 30-second and 2-minute OEI rati ngs should be selected together, meaning the 30-\\nsecond OEI rating cannot be sel ected without the 2- minute OEI rating, and vice versa.  When \\nintroduced to part 33, the two rating s were intended to always be selected together since engines \\nhaving any of these two ratings without the other would not be acceptable under the rotorcraft regulations of parts 27 and 29.  Although part 33 does not specifica lly state the two ratings must \\nbe selected together, part 33 requirements were constructed around that assumption.  For \\nexample, the test schedule in § 33.87(f) is pres cribed for the combined 30-second and 2-minute \\nOEI ratings, and there is no test schedule fo r only 30-second or only 2-minute OEI rating.  \\n \\n     d.  The definitions and requirements relate d to rotorcraft engine OEI ratings have changed \\nseveral times since they were first adopted, making it difficult to establish a commonality \\nbetween engines certified across several decades.  Historically, rotorcraft engine OEI ratings \\nwere added to CAR 13 and part 33 in response to  requests from the industry.  For example, the \\n30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings comb ination was introduced as a higher power \\nalternative to the 2½ -minute OEI rating, and the continuous OEI rating was introduced as a \\nlonger duration alternative to the 30-minute OE I rating.  See appendix 2 of this AC for a \\nsummary of revisions to rating defini tions since they were first adopted. \\n \\n10.  Auxiliary Power Unit (APU) Mode of Operation - §  33.7(c)(1)(x) .  APU mode of \\noperation is available for a tur bopropeller engine with “free-tu rbine” design.  This mode of \\noperation is a turbopropeller engine design feature where the engine  is equipped with a propeller \\nbrake.  The brake allows the pr opeller to stop operating while th e gas generator portion of the \\nengine continues to operate as an APU.  The APU generates mechanical  shaft power to drive \\nengine accessories, such as the electric gene rator or the hydraulic pump, for the ground operation \\nof the aircraft.  The APU mode may also be used for the purpos e of bleed air extraction.  The \\napplicant must establish the operating limitations  associated with the APU mode, for example \\nspeed, torque, temperature, and bleed airflow, and identify them in the TCDS.  \\n \\n11.  Operating Limitations – General. \\n \\n     a.  The applicant must specify the engine operating limitations associated with each of the \\nratings in § 33.7, paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (x).   For each rating, specify the torque, rotor  \\n 7\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\nspeed (R.P.M.), gas temperature, and time limits required in § 33.7(c)(1).  In addition, specify \\nthe limitations in § 33.7, paragr aphs (c)(2) through (c )(18).  These operating limitations may be \\nestablished by design, or may result from findings during engine certification.  During \\ncertification, the applicant has numerous oppor tunities to demonstr ate the validity and \\nacceptability of these operating limitations.  At no time is an engine allowed to exceed its operating limitations for the purpose of producing the corresponding rated power or thrust.  In \\naddition to those listed in § 33.7(c), the FAA may establish operating limitations when necessary \\nbecause of certification resu lts (refer to § 33.7(a)).   \\n \\n          (1)  At the rated power or thru st, new production engines usually operate below the \\nrating’s operating limitations, thus having margin s to the actual limits.  These margins are \\nusually called performance margins.  Older engines may have diminished performance \\nmargins, a condition known as “engine dete rioration.” Deteriorated engines must \\ncontinue to produce the rated power or th rust within the approved operating limits.  \\nDeteriorated engine performance margins may be recovered through engine overhaul \\nand/or engine maintenance actions. \\n \\n     b.  The operating limitations must be listed  in the TCDS.  Certain lim itations, such as speed, \\ntemperature, and torque, should be identified in asso ciation with each engine rating, when \\napplicable.  \\n \\n12.  Torque, Rotational Speed (R.P.M.) and Gas Temperature for Each Rating - \\n§ 33.7(c)(1) . \\n \\n     a.  For each rating, the applicant must dete rmine and list in the TCDS the limits for engine \\nshaft torque, rotational speeds, and gas temperature.  \\n \\n         (1)  Shaft torque limits must be prescr ibed for the turboshaft and turbopropeller engines.  In \\naddition to the limits, indicate the location where th e shaft torque is limited.  For example, for a \\nturbopropeller engine indicate whet her the shaft torque is measured  before or after the gear box. \\n \\n         (2)  The limits for engine rotational speeds may be for a single engine module, such as for \\nthe fan speed, or multiple engine modules, such as for the low, intermediate, and high pressure \\nrotors.  \\n \\n         (3)  For gas temperature limits, the location where the temperatur e is measured should be \\nidentified as either turbine inlet temperature (TIT ), or inter-turbine temp erature (ITT), or exhaust \\ngas temperature (EGT).  \\n \\n     b.  The limits for engine shaft torque, rotational speeds, and gas te mperature in § 33.7(c)(1) \\nare for steady state values and do not include transients.  When tr ansient limits are established, \\nthey must be identified separately as transien ts and noted in the TCDS  (see paragraphs 21 and 22 \\nof this AC for further guidance). \\n 8\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\n13.  Fuel, Oil and Hydraulic  Fluid Specification - §  33.7, Paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) . \\n \\n     a.  The FAA adds to the TC, as operati ng limitations, specifications  for fuels, oils, and \\nhydraulic fluids based on evidence from engine tests or acceptable data as part of the type \\ncertification program.  The specifica tions should be U.S. industry or  military specifications or \\ntheir equivalent.  Fuel additives, such as anti-ice,  anti-corrosion, or anti-static additives, must \\nalso be FAA approved on an individual basis for each type of fuel.  Examples of specifications \\naccepted by the FAA are: \\n \\n         (1)  For fuels:  ASTM D 1655 grad e Jet A, or Jet A-1, or MIL-DTL-83133 grade JP-8.   \\n \\n         (2)  For oils:  SAE AS5780 gas turb ine lubricants; also FAA approved commercial brand \\nand type of oil. \\n \\n     b.  All specifications for fuels, oils, and hydraulic fluids must be listed in the TCDS.  Fuels, oils, or hydraulic fluids that are not in confor mance with the TCDS specification are not eligible \\nfor use in a certified engine.  For emergency use,  the applicant may specify a substitute fuel and \\nits usage time limit.  The applicant must  obtain FAA approval for adding or removing \\nspecifications from the TCDS or engine manuals , as well as for changes to an FAA approved \\nspecification.   \\n \\n     c.  Fuel, oil, or hydraulic fluid limitations, including the temp erature and pressu re discussed in \\nparagraphs 14 and 15 of this AC, must be listed in the TCDS. \\n \\n14.  Temperature of Oil, Fuel and Engine Surface - §  33.7, Paragraphs (c)(5)(i), (c)(5)(iv) \\nand (c)(5)(v) . \\n \\n     a.  Temperature of oil at a loca tion specified by the applicant, § 33.7(c)(5)(i) .  The applicant \\nmust establish oil temperature limits that should include maximum steady state, maximum \\ntransient with time duration limit, and minimum va lues.  The oil temperature limits must be \\nspecified in the TCDS together with the loca tion where the oil temperature is measured and, \\nwhen applicable, the associated engine opera ting conditions such as starting, relighting, or \\nacceleration for takeoff.  The location must be ex plicitly identified, such as “oil temperature at \\nthe outlet of oil pump.”  A statement such as “o il inlet” is not sufficiently descriptive.   \\n \\n     b.  Temperature of fuel at a loca tion specified by the applicant, § 33.7(c)(5)(iv) .  The \\napplicant must establish fuel temperature lim its that should include maximum steady state, \\nmaximum transient with time duration limit, a nd minimum values.  When applicable, the \\napplicant must specify whether the temperature limits are related to certain engine operating \\nconditions such as starting or relighting.  The fu el temperature limits must be specified in the \\nTCDS together with the location where the fuel te mperature is measured.  The location must be \\nexplicitly identified, such as “maximum fuel te mperature at low pressure fuel pump inlet.”   \\n \\n 9\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\nA statement such as “fuel inlet” is not sufficiently descriptive.  When additives are used for anti-\\nice and other reasons, the applicant must sp ecify the fuel temperature which requires the \\nadditive. \\n \\n     c.  Temperature of external surfaces  of the engine, if spec ified by the applicant, \\n§ 33.7(c)(5)(v) .  When the applicant determines that a temperature limit for the external surfaces \\nof the engine is necessary, the limit must be  specified in the TCDS.  The maximum engine \\nexternal surface temperatures may include the temp eratures of engine cases, external plumbing \\n(such as lines, fittings, valves, etc.), and extern al accessories and components.  Alternately, the \\napplicant may specify the nacelle temperature li mit for the environment in which the engine \\ncases, accessories and components are exposed. \\n \\n15.  Pressure of Fuel, Oil and Hydraulic Fluid - §  33.7, Paragraphs (c)(6)(i), (c)(6)(ii) and \\n(c)(6)(iv) . \\n \\n     a.  Pressure of fuel at the fuel inlet, § 33.7(c)(6)(i) .  The fuel pressure limits may include the \\nminimum and maximum pressures, and when applicable, the asso ciated ambient conditions or \\nvapor-to-liquid ratio.  Different sets of limits may be established for di fferent engine operating \\nconditions, such as for ground starting, operation, a nd air starting.  The fuel pressure limits, the \\nassociated engine and ambient conditions, and the location(s) on the fuel inlet where they are \\nmeasured must be listed in the TCDS.  The loca tion(s) must be explicitly identified, such as \\n“maximum fuel pressure at high pressure fuel pump exit.”  A statement such as “fuel inlet” is not \\nsufficient.  \\n \\n     b.  Pressure of oil at a locati on specified by the applicant, § 33.7(c)(6)(ii) .  The oil pressure \\nlimits may include the minimum and maximum steady state values, transient values and \\nassociated time duration, ambient temperatures, or engine operating conditions.  These limits, the \\nassociated conditions, and the location(s) where the oil pressure is measured must be listed in the \\nTCDS.  The location(s) must be e xplicitly identified, such as “m inimum oil pump exit pressure.”  \\nA statement such as “oil inlet” is not sufficiently descriptive. \\n \\n     c.  Pressure of hydraulic fluid, § 33.7(c)(6)(iv) .  The limits for hydraulic fluid pressures \\nshould include maximum and minimum hydraulic fluid pressures at s ea level and altitude \\nconditions, as applicable.  These limits and the lo cation(s) in the engine where the hydraulic fluid \\npressure is measured must be li sted in the TCDS.  The location(s)  must be explicitly identified, \\nsuch as “maximum hydraulic fluid pressure at hydraulic fluid pump exit.”  A statement such as “hydraulic fluid inlet” is not sufficiently descriptive.   \\n \\n16.  Accessory Drive Torque and Overhang Moment - §  33.7(c)(7) .  This requirement applies \\nto the accessory drives provided for installation of  components that are not part of engine type \\ndesign.  These drives, usually called customer drives, provide power to components such as \\nstarters, generators, alternators, pumps, and pr opeller gearbox.  For each drive, the applicant \\nmust identify in the TCDS the component type s and indicate the power  extraction, torque,  \\n 10\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\noverhang moment, and any additional informati on needed for its installation, such as drive \\ndirection of rotation and speed.      \\n \\n17.  Component Life, and the Number of Star t-Stop Stress Cycles Approved for Each \\nRotor Disc and Spacer - §  33.7, Paragraphs (c)(8) and (c)(12) .  For the approved ratings, the \\napplicant must identify (1) the life-limited components and establish their life limits by the \\nnumber of start-stop cycles, or number of hours in operation, as applicable, and (2) any \\nmandatory inspections.  The applicant must esta blish the life limits and mandatory inspections \\nfor the components required in part 33 includi ng, but not limited to, § 33.64 Pressurized engine \\nstatic parts, § 33.70 Engine life-limited parts,  and A33.4 the Airworthin ess limitations section.  \\nComponents lives must be identified in the TC DS by reference to the airworthiness limitation \\nsection of the instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA).  \\n \\n18.  Fuel and Oil Filtration - §  33.7, Paragraphs (c)(9) and (c)(10) .  Any operating limitation \\nestablished for the fuel and oil filtration, such as filter requirements, filter part number or \\nidentification, must be listed in the TCDS  or identified by reference to FAA approved \\ndocumentation, such as installation or operati on manuals.  Such limitations may result from \\ncompliance with the requirements of § 33.67 for th e fuel system and § 33.71 for the oil system. \\n \\n19.  Bleed Air - §  33.7(c)(11) .  The applicant must determine the limitations associated with the \\nuse of bleed air, and identify a ll such limitations in the TCDS.  For each bleed port, specify the \\nairflow extraction limits, such as the maximum a llowable airflow rate and the related engine \\nconditions, such as the engine operating environm ent (rotating speeds, ambient conditions) or the \\nrelative usage of other bleed ports.  Bleed ports must be identified in the TCDS by their exact \\nlocations.  Examples of aircraft system bleed  use are wing and cowling anti-ice, aircraft \\nenvironmental control systems (air conditioning), and engine cross-bleed starting.  \\n \\n20.  Inlet Air Distortion at the Engine Inlet - §  33.7(c)(13) .  The applicant must define the inlet \\ndistortion limit(s) for which the en gine is shown to comply with part 33 requirements.  The inlet \\nair distortion must be identified in the TCDS. \\n \\n21.  Transient Rotor Shaft Overspeed, Gas Ov ertemperature, and Engine Overtorque - \\n§ 33.7, Paragraphs (c)(14), (c)(15), and c(16) . \\n \\n     a.  The transient limit for rotor shaft ove rspeed, gas overtemperature, or shaft overtorque is \\nintended for speed, temperature, or torque overs hoots above the limits in § 33.7(c)(1), usually \\noccurring during engine accelera tion and prior to reaching the steady state limit value.  The \\napplicant must define each overspeed, overtempera ture, or overtorque transient by its value, time \\nduration limit, and maximum number of occurrences.  Each transient must be noted in the TCDS.  \\nThe time duration for a transient should not exceed 10 seconds for the 2½-minute, 2-minute, and 30-second OEI ratings and 30 seconds for all other ratings.  When a transient limit only applies  \\n \\n \\n 11\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\nto a specific rating or cannot be used in conjunction with other ra tings, note the restriction in the \\nTCDS. \\n \\n     b.  The applicant must determine whet her overspeed, overtemperature, or overtorque \\ntransients should be defined for each rating or for only the takeoff rating.  All transients and \\nassociated limitations must be listed in the TCDS.  \\n \\n     c.  Transient overspeed, overtemperature, and overtorque limits are established and validated \\nbased on the endurance test in § 33.87 and any other applicable part 33 requirements.  For \\ndifferences between the transient overtorque limits and maximum e ngine overtorque, see \\nparagraph 22.b. of this AC.  \\n \\n22.  Maximum engine overtorque for turbopro peller and turboshaft engines incorporating \\nfree power turbines - §  33.7, Paragraph (c)(17) .   \\n \\n     a.  The maximum engine overtorque, as  defined in § 1.1, applie s to turbopropeller and \\nturboshaft engines incorporating free power turbines and is limited in use to periods of up to 20 \\nseconds.  The applicant may establish a maximum engine overtorque limit for any engine rating, \\nexcept OEI ratings of two minutes or less.  The applicant must list in the TCDS the maximum \\nengine overtorque value and its associated  time duration, not to exceed 20 seconds.  \\n \\n     b.  The applicant may select a maximum engine overtorque limit based on the engine design \\nneeds and compliance with applicable part 33 requirements, such as §§ 33.84 and 33.87.  In \\naddition, the applicant must establish the maximu m engine overtorque per requirements in § 1.1.  \\nThe maximum engine overtorque differs from the tr ansient engine overtorque with respect to the \\ncause and required actions.  The maximum engine overtorque is an allowance for the engine exceeding the shaft torque limits b ecause of a failure and its occurrence requires correction of the \\nfailure cause.  The transient engine overtorque  occurs during normal engine operation, such as \\nfollowing acceleration, and does not requi re any specific maintenance action.  \\n \\n23.  Selection of Engine Po wer and Thrust Ratings - §  33.8.  \\n   \\n     a.  The applicant selects the engine power and thrust ratings  as part of the TC application \\nfrom those in § 33.7, paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (x).  When a rating other than those listed in \\n§ 33.7, paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (x) is desired, the applicant may request that rating in a special condition or may request use of existing special conditions when applicable.  For an \\nexample of additional ratings the FAA has approved, see paragraph 6.b. of this AC. \\n \\n     b.  Each rated power or thrust must be for the lowest value that all engines of the same type \\n(that is, same model) may be expected to produce within the engine operating limitations \\nassociated with the rating and under the conditi ons used to determine the rating (refer to \\n§ 33.8(b)).  These conditions are identified in § 1.1 for each rating, and include ambient \\nconditions and engine configuration (see paragraph 6.f. of this AC).  All engine configurations of  \\n 12\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n \\n \\nthe same engine model must be able to achieve  the rated power or thru st for compliance with \\nthese requirements.  For example, an engine  model may have several power or thrust \\nmanagement configurations realized by what are known as “rating plugs.”  These configurations \\nare acceptable only if the engine is  able to obtain the rated power or thrust without exceeding the \\noperating limitations.  In other words, the rati ng plugs should not restri ct obtaining the rated \\npower or thrust, otherwise the engine is not compliant with § 33.8(b).    \\n \\n     c.  The applicant should provide the mean s by which to determine that any engine, regardless \\nif new or in-service, can produce the type certificate rated power or thrust within the rating’s \\noperating limitations.  For example, engine acce ptance tests or performance check tests may \\nsatisfy this requirement when included or refe renced in the type cer tification documentation.  \\nThe power or thrust verified through these tests should be corrected to the conditions used to \\ndetermine the rating and listed in the TCDS (refer to § 33.8 (b) and paragraph 6.f. of this AC).  \\nThe corrected power or thrust should not be less than the rated value listed in the TCDS; \\notherwise, the engine is not compliant with its type design. \\n \\n     d.  The applicant must also include in the TC DS the variation of the rated power or thrust with \\nthe ambient temperature.  For example, for a flat  rated engine, the rated power or thrust remains \\nconstant up to the ambient temperature when one or more operating limitations are reached.  \\nBeyond this temperature, known as “corner point,” the available pow er or thrust decreases.   \\n \\n \\n \\nFrancis A.

The FAA first adopted engine ratings in the Civil Aviation Regulation (CAR) as CAR-13, \\namendment 1 in 1957.  That amendment introduced and defined takeoff pow er or thrust rating \\nand the maximum continuous power or thrust rating.  The information in this appendix is \\narranged in chronological order, as ratings definitions were  revised, starting with CAR 13-1 \\nthrough part 33, amendment 25.   \\n \\n2.  Rated takeoff and maximum continuous  thrust, augmented and unaugmented: \\n \\n     a.  The definitions first adopted for thes e ratings were under the nomenclatures of “takeoff \\nthrust” and “maximum continuous thrust” in  CAR-13 by amendment 1, effective 8/12/1957.  \\n \\n     b.  Rating nomenclatures were later cha nged in § 1.1 by amendment 3 to part 33, effective \\n4/3/1967, from “takeoff thrust” to “rated takeoff thrust” and from “maximum continuous thrust” to “rated maximum continuous thrust.”  In additio n, the definitions were revised with regard to \\nthe test conditions re quired for developing the rated thrust. \\n \\n     c.  The current definitions for these rati ngs were introduced in § 1.1 by amendment 6 to part \\n33, effective 10/31/1974.  This amendment revised existing definitions as follows: \\n \\n         (1)  Revised the “rated takeoff thru st” and “rated maximum con tinuous thrust” definitions \\nto clarify they are “unaugmented,” by adding “w ithout fluid injection a nd without the burning of \\nfuel in a separate combustion chamber.”  \\n \\n         (2)  Added new definitions for the “r ated takeoff thrust augmen ted” and “rated maximum \\ncontinuous thrust augmented.” \\n \\n3.  Rated takeoff and maximum conti nuous power, augmented and unaugmented: \\n \\n     a.  The definitions first adopted for thes e ratings were under the nomenclatures of “takeoff \\npower” and “maximum continuous power” in CAR-13 by amendment 1, effective 8/12/1957.  \\n \\n     b.  Rating nomenclatures were later cha nged in § 1.1 by amendment 3 to part 33, effective \\n4/3/1967, from “takeoff power” to “rated takeoff power” and from “maximum continuous \\npower” to “rated maximum continuous power.”  In addition, the definitio ns were revised with \\nregard to the test conditions required for developing the rated power.  These are the current \\ndefinitions. \\n \\n \\n \\nA2-1\\n6/28/10            AC 33.7-1 \\n             Appendix 2 \\n \\n \\n     c.  No definitions exist in part 1.1 for “rated takeoff power augmen ted” and “rated maximum \\ncontinuous power augmented.”  However, these ratings are identified in part 33 regulations, \\nincluding 33.7 and 33.87.  Although these definitions  were not added during prior amendments,  \\n \\nthey are similar to the definiti ons for the “rated takeoff thrust  augmented” and “rated maximum \\ncontinuous thrust augmented.”   \\n \\n4.  Rated 30-minute OEI power, § 33.7(c)(1)(v).   \\n \\n     a.  This rating was adopted in CA R 13 by amendment 5, effective 2/12/1963, and its \\ndefinition was added in § 13.1.  \\n \\n     b.  The rating’s nomenclature was later changed in § 1.1 and part  33 by original version, \\neffective 2/1/1965, from “30-minute power for helicopter turbine engi nes” to “30-minute \\npower.”  \\n \\n     c.  The next revision to this rating’s de finition was introduced in § 1.1 by amendment 3 to part \\n33, effective 4/3/1967.  The “30-minute power” no menclature was amended by inserting the \\nword “rated” before 30-minute power to  read:  “rated 30-minute power.” \\n \\n     d.  The next revision to this rating’s definition was introduced in § 1.1 by amendment 12 to \\npart 33, effective 10/3/1988.  This revision adde d “OEI” to the rating nomenclature to read \\n“rated 30-minute OEI power” to better  identify its intended use.   \\n \\n     e.  The rating’s definition was later re vised in § 1.1 by amendment 25 to part 33, effective \\n10/17/2008.  The OEI condition was revi sed from “the failure of one engine” to “the failure or \\nshutdown of one engine.”  The definition remains unchanged to date. \\n \\n5.  Rated 2½-minute OEI power, § 33.7(c)(1)(vi).   \\n \\n     a.  This rating was adopted in CA R 13 by amendment 6, effective 4/22/1964, and its \\ndefinition was added in § 13.1. \\n \\n     b.

The “2½- minute power” was amended by inserting the word “rated” \\nbefore the 2½-minute power to read: “rated 2½-minute power.” \\n \\n     d.  The next revision to this rating’s definition was introduced in § 1.1 by amendment 12 to \\npart 33, effective 10/3/1988.  This revision adde d “OEI” to the rating nomenclature to read \\n“rated 2½-minute OEI power” to bett er identify its intended use.  \\n \\n \\n     e.  The rating’s definition was later re vised in § 1.1 by amendment 25 to part 33, effective \\n10/17/2008.  The OEI condition was revi sed from “the failure of one engine” to “the failure or \\nshutdown of one engine.”  This revision also clarified that more  than a single 2½-minute period \\nis permitted for one flight by changing from “limited in use to a period of not more than 2½ \\nminutes” to “for periods of use no longer than  2½ minutes each.”  The definition remains \\nunchanged to date. \\n \\n6.

BACKGROUND. a. The manufacture of titanium alloy forged rotating components can introduce component life \\nlimiting anomalies at all stages of material processing, from sponge processing, through \\nmelting, billet conversion, component forging, and inspection of the finished component. Since \\noptimum capability to detect these anomalies may vary according to their type and source in \\nthe manufacturing process, the manufacturing process should be established so that, at each \\nstage, appropriate controls and inspections are in place to minimize the occurrence of and to maximize detection of, such anomalies based on the best \\navailable technologies. \\nb. The conventional melting process for titanium alloys has been the VAR process. Triple VAR \\nhas been recommended as the current standard for critical rotating component use. Improvements in VAR technology have resulted in a significant reduction in the occurrence of \\nmelt related defects since the mid 1980\\'s. The newer CHM technology virtually eliminates the \\nrisk of having HDI\\'s survive through the melting cycle. Current cold hearth melting technology \\ninvolves a CHM cycle either PAM or EBM followed by a final VAR cycle. \\nc. Advisory Circulars 21-1B, 21-6A, 21-9A, 21-27, and 21.303-1A, provide a means to obtain \\nand maintain production approvals; however, these documents do not fully cover the \\nmanufacturing processes used in the manufacture of premium quality titanium alloy forged \\nrotating components for type certificated turbine engines. This AC, therefore, provides \\nsupplemental guidance for the establishment of manufacturing processes, in-process material \\nand component inspections, and finished component inspections, for manufacture of premium \\nquality titanium alloy forged rotating components, such as disks, spacers, hubs, shafts, spools \\nand impellers, but not blades. \\n5. GENERAL. a. Part 21 of the Federal Aviation Regulations requires that PAH’s must establish and \\nmaintain, as \\nappropriate, manufacturing and process control and inspection systems which ensure that \\nproducts used in type certificated engines conform to FAA-approved design data. \\nb. PAH’s should also assure, through appropriate agreements with their suppliers, that \\neffective process control documents are developed, identifying significant process control points, parameters and control limits. Measurement of these process control parameters \\nshould be made at the control points; consideration should be given to use of statistical \\nprocess control. \\nc. A method of approval of changes to the process control documents, as well as the means of \\nhandling exceedences of any defined control limits, should be established between the PAH \\nand the suppliers. Process phases where inclusions could be formed or entrapped, or segregation generated, or porosity induced should be particularly detailed for methods of \\ncontrol, monitoring and detection. \\nd. Records of material and component inspection and disposition results, property test results, \\ntraceability of forged components to billet location, material heat, and to raw material ingredient \\nlots making up the heat, as well as other records indicated in this AC, should be maintained for \\nthe appropriate period of time and be available for review as needed. \\ne. New melters and raw material suppliers and their processes should be adequately qualified. \\nf. A system of handling deviations and non-conformances with respect to product or part limits \\nshould be established between the PAH and the suppliers. \\n6. RAW MATERIALS & STORAGE. \\na. Raw Material Requirements. (1) Raw Material Controls. Melt suppliers should maintain effective specifications and \\nprocedures for procurement, storage, and processing of charge materials for VAR, PAM, or \\nEBM. For procured raw materials, the raw material supplier should inspect its raw material on \\na sampling plan sufficient to assure compliance with the melt supplier raw material \\nprocurement specifications. The melt supplier should inspect raw material sufficient to verify \\nconformance to its procurement specifications. \\n(a) Charge Composition. The charge materials should be composed of only approved raw \\nmaterials, such as sponge, master alloys, elemental additions, titanium oxide, and recycle \\nmaterial (where permitted). The weight percent, chemical composition, and batch or lot number \\nof each type of raw material used in the charge materials should be recorded and maintained for each heat of material. \\n(b) Titanium Sponge. Titanium sponge suppliers should have established procedures and \\nlimits for the production of high purity premium quality titanium sponge. A representative \\nsample of each sponge lot should be visually inspected to established standards to ensure its freedom from burned particles capable of causing HID\\'s, and from other contaminants. Sponge \\nparticles removed during this inspection should be evaluated to determine if the entire sponge lot should be subject to disqualification. Specific \\nacceptance standards, including chemical analysis of suspect sponge particles, should be \\nestablished by the titanium sponge supplier. Sponge batches and/or lots which have been \\ninvolved in a fire at any stage of their processing should not be considered for premium quality \\nrotor application. \\n(c) Zirconium Sponge. Zirconium sponge suppliers should have established procedures and \\nlimits for the production of high purity zirconium sponge. Each zirconium sponge lot should \\nhave a representative sample visually inspected to established standards to identify and \\nremove particles suspected of containing either burned sponge or other contaminants considered to cause HID\\'s. Suspect particles from this inspection should be removed and \\nevaluated to determine if the entire sponge lot should be subject to disqualification. Specific acceptance standards, including chemical analysis of suspect sponge particles, should be \\nestablished by the zirconium sponge supplier. Any zirconium sponge batch and/or lot which \\nhas been involved in a fire after inspection should not be considered for premium quality rotor application. \\n(d) Master Alloys. Master alloy suppliers should have established procedures and limits for the \\nproduction of high purity master alloy. Master alloys should be inspected to established \\nstandards to identify and remove detrimental foreign material, oxides, nitrides, and other contaminants considered to cause HID\\'s or other deleterious inclusions. \\n(e) Elemental Additions. Elemental additions should be processed to preclude contaminants \\nconsidered to cause HID\\'s or other deleterious inclusions. \\n(f) Titanium Oxide. Oxides of titanium used as raw material charge should be in powder form and be processed to preclude the presence of detrimental foreign material. \\n(g) Recycle Material. All recycle materials should be cleaned and be free from contamination. \\nThe following limitations should be considered when recycling previously melted alloy: \\n1. Multiple VAR Processed Material. In general, only turnings should be permitted to be directly \\nrecycled in multiple VAR processed premium quality titanium alloy. When used as recycle \\nmaterial, turnings should be segregated as to alloy, crushed and cleaned, and should be 100 \\npercent radiographically inspected for particles considered to cause HDI\\'s and the particles \\nremoved. Bulk weldables should be prohibited for use in Multiple VAR processed material, \\nexcept when previously melted (consolidated) by an approved CHM process. The restrictions on use of bulk weldables in such a CHM consolidation melt should follow the limitations set \\nforth in the following paragraph which applies to material which has been PAM or EBM melted as the primary melting operation. \\n2. CHM Plus VAR. Previously melted materials may be recycled through the primary CHM \\nprocess provided the material is clean, free of scale and slag. Recycle material should be of \\nthe same alloy. Preparation and cleaning procedures should be established for each form of \\nrecycle material. Each form of recycle material should be cleaned and inspected to established standards. Radiographic inspection may be considered unnecessary for turnings. Material \\nforms with surface connected internal cavities, \\nenfoliations, and other features which prevent complete visual inspection, should not be \\nrecycled. Recycling of grinding products, dust, and sludge should be prohibited. Recycle of \\nmaterial that has been involved in a fire at any stage of hearth melt charge material preparation should be prohibited. \\nb. Bottom Charge Materials. If a bottom charge is used for VAR, the composition, form and \\npreparation procedures should be established; sponge should not be used as bottom charge. \\nc. Raw Material Storage. All virgin raw material, turnings and bottom charges should be stored \\nin covered containers, in a secure area, immediately after inspection to preclude the \\nextraneous addition of foreign or uninspected material. \\n7. CONSOLIDATION AND MELTING. \\na. This section details some of the more significant process parameters, controls and \\nprocedures recommended in the areas of input material consolidation and ingot melting for the production of premium quality titanium. These items should be viewed as guidelines which, \\nwhen incorporated into the suppliers specific method of manufacture, will result in minimizing \\nHDI and HID occurrence, and produce sound ingot with acceptable homogeneity. \\nb. Consolidation. Fixed blending and consolidation practices should be established by the \\nsupplier and approved by the PAH. Proper preparation, blending, and consolidation practices \\nnot only minimize HID and HDI introduction sources, but can also assist in the elimination of \\nHID\\'s from sponge type input materials. \\n(1) Multiple VAR Process. Double or triple VAR processes typically use blended input \\nmaterials consolidated either by compaction and welding or by consolidation melting. \\n(a) Blending. Procedures should be established by the supplier for selecting and preparing the \\ninput materials with respect to size and shape. Blending practices should be demonstrated that \\nachieve acceptable chemical homogeneity in the final ingot product. Procedures should also be established to preclude excessive deblending during handling and compaction prior to the \\nfirst melt. Caution and inspection, as required, should be applied to preclude fires from material crushing, handling and blending, and to exclude any material exposed to such a fire. \\n(b) Compaction. Procedures should be established for compacting the input materials in a form \\nthat facilitates the supplier’s consolidation practice. Compact size and shape, and compaction \\npressure, should be a fixed practice. Caution and inspection, as required, should be applied to \\nassure no local fires are created during compaction, and to exclude any material exposed to \\nsuch a fire. \\n(c) Primary Electrode Fabrication. \\n1. Welding. When a primary electrode is fabricated by welding, all welding should be \\nconducted in an inert gas filled or a vacuum chamber. Tungsten Inert Gas (TIG) or graphite \\nelectrode weld processes should not be used for the electrode construction. Welds should be visually inspected at a minimum for atmospheric \\ncontamination; contaminated welds should be removed and replaced prior to primary melting. \\nWhen \\nappropriate, limits and procedures for the chamber weld should be established for the \\nfollowing: \\n(i) chamber leak-up rate, \\n(ii) chamber pressure, \\n(iii) plasma torch gas, and purge, (iv) metal-inert gas (MIG) weld wire, (v) electrode cooling prior to venting chamber. 2. Consolidation Melt Fabrication. Some or all of the charge material may be prepared using \\nan established consolidation melt procedure before the primary VAR step. Effective controls and limits for the consolidation process should be maintained for producing material free from \\ncontamination known to cause HID\\'s and HDI\\'s. The consolidation melt should be performed in \\nan inert gas filled or a vacuum chamber. For the non-consumable electrode processes, the electrode should be constructed to avoid the introduction of HDI\\'s or other deleterious \\nmaterials into the melt. Tungsten or graphite electrodes should not be used. When a CHM \\nrefining process is used as the consolidation melt, additional practices, procedures and limits \\nshould be established as identified in 7.c.(2) (Cold Hearth Melting). The consolidated ingot \\nshould be inspected prior to VAR for surface contamination caused by coolant or air leaks. \\nLimits and procedures should be established for the consolidation melt chamber with respect \\nto the following: \\n(i) chamber leak-up rate, (ii) chamber pressure, and \\n(iii) input material feed system. \\n(d) Electrode Mechanical/Electrical Attachment. When the possibility exists that the electrode \\nattachment material may be consumed during melting, the attachment material should have \\nthe same nominal composition and quality level as the electrode; and should be prepared and inspected using established procedures. The attachment should be joined to the electrode \\nusing established inert gas in-chamber welding procedures or plunge-arc welding in a vacuum \\nchamber. Limits and procedures for weld chamber leak detection should be established. When \\nappropriate, limits and procedures for the chamber welds should be established for the \\nfollowing: \\n1. leak-up rate, 2. chamber pressure, \\n3. plasma torch gas and purge, \\n4. metal inert gas (MIG) weld wire, and 5. weld cooling prior to venting chamber. \\nWhen plunge welding is used, procedures should be established for the following: \\n1. depth of plunge, \\n2. voltage and amperage, 3. rundown, and 4. leak-up rate. When feasible, all welds should be visually inspected to established standards. \\n(2) CHM Plus VAR Process. EBM or PAM CHM processes typically use blended input \\nmaterials that are either compacted as small briquettes for particulate feed, or consolidated \\nusing either VAR or one of the non-consumable electrode melt processes. Input material \\nrequirements for CHM are the same as the multiple VAR process, with the exception that \\nturnings may not require X-ray inspection because the CHM process effectively removes HDI\\'s. \\n(a) Blending. Procedures should be established by the supplier for selecting and preparing the \\ninput materials with respect to size and shape. Blending practices should be demonstrated that \\nachieve acceptable chemical homogeneity in the final ingot product. Procedures should also be established to preclude excessive deblending during handling and compaction prior to the \\nfirst melt. Caution and inspections, as required, should be applied to preclude fires from material crushing, handling and blending and to exclude any material exposed to such a fire. \\n(b) Compaction. Procedures should be established for compacting the input materials into a \\nform that facilitates the suppliers consolidation melt or CHM practice. Compact size and shape, \\nand compaction pressure, should be a fixed practice. As a minimum, the sponge, master alloy, \\nelemental additions, titanium dioxide and turnings should be compacted. Caution and \\ninspections, as required, should be applied to assure no local fires are created during \\ncompaction, and to exclude any material exposed to such a fire. \\n(c) Consolidation Melt Prior to CHM. Some or all of the charge material may be prepared using \\nan established consolidation melt procedure before charging the CHM furnace. Effective \\ncontrols and limits for the consolidation process should be maintained for producing material \\nfree from contamination known to cause HID\\'s and HDI\\'s. The consolidation melt should be \\nperformed in an inert gas filled or a vacuum chamber. For the non-consumable electrode \\nprocesses, the electrode should be constructed to avoid the introduction of high density or \\nother deleterious materials into the melt. Tungsten or graphite electrodes should not be used. \\nFor the VAR consolidation process, procedures identified in 7.b.(1) (Multiple VAR \\nProcess) for input material consolidation and in 7.c.(1) (Multiple VAR Process) for melting should be \\nfollowed. The consolidated ingot should be visually inspected prior to CHM for surface \\ncontamination caused by water or air leaks. \\n1. Mechanical Attachment. When the possibility exists that the push rod mechanical \\nattachment may be consumed during melting, the push rod should have the same nominal \\ncomposition and quality level as the charge material; and should be prepared and inspected \\nusing established procedures. If welding is used, the push rod should be joined to the consolidation melt using established inert gas in-chamber welding \\nprocedures or plunge arc welding in a vacuum chamber. Limits and procedures for weld \\nchamber leak \\ndetection should be established. When appropriate, limits and procedures for the mechanical \\nattachment chamber welds should be established for the following: \\n(i) leak-up rate, (ii) chamber pressure, (iii) plasma torch gas and purge, (iv) metal-inert-gas (MIG) weld wire, and \\n(v) procedures for venting chamber.\\n \\nWhen plunge welding is used, procedures should be established for the following:\\n (i) depth of plunge,\\n (ii) voltage and amperage,\\n (iii) rundown, and\\n \\n(iv) leak-up rate.\\n \\nThe weld should be visually inspected to established standards. Since electrical contact of the \\npush rod is not required, mechanical methods of joining the push rod may be employed. \\nc. Primary Melting. Primary melting may be accomplished by either the VAR of an electrode \\nwhich has been consolidated as described in 7.b.(1) (Multiple VAR Process), or by the CHM of \\ninput materials which have been processed as described in 7.b.(2) (CHM Plus VAR Process). \\n(1) Multiple VAR Process. The first melt for the multiple VAR process should be conducted \\nusing a fixed melt practice established by the supplier and approved by the PAH. A \\nconsumable electrode process should be used, which incorporates effective controls and limits \\nshown to minimize the occurrence of HID\\'s and HDI\\'s. Care should be taken to terminate \\nmelting before any non-premium material is melted. \\n(a) Critical Parameters. When using the VAR process to produce primary melt ingot, limits and \\nprocedures should be established by the supplier to control the following: \\n1. bottom charge (initial charge), \\n2. pressure/leak rate, \\n3. power levels, \\n4. melt rate/gap control, 5. arc focusing controls, \\n6. end of melt control/indicators, \\n7. crucible cooling, 8. annulus control, 9. interruptions (power, pressure), 10. coolant leaks, and \\n11. electrode orientation practice. \\n(b) Multiple Stick Melting - Precautions. Multiple stick melting is an acceptable, but not \\npreferred, practice. When multiple stick melting is used to produce a primary ingot of sufficient \\nsize for subsequent melts, care should be taken to assure cooling to appropriate temperatures prior to any furnace opening. Piggy back melting of a second electrode on top of the first ingot \\nshould not be allowed. The primary ingots should be removed from the VAR furnace, cleaned, \\nand chamber-weld joined prior to the second VAR step. Multiple stick melting should not be \\nused beyond manufacture of the primary ingot. \\n(2) Cold Hearth Melting. When the CHM practice is used to produce a primary melt ingot, a \\nfixed melt process should be established at the CHM supplier and approved by the PAH. The \\nheat source used during the CHM melting process should be designed to preclude its being \\nthe source of high density or other deleterious materials entering the melt. \\n(a) Critical Parameters for EBM and PAM. When using either the EBM or PAM CHM method to \\nproduce primary melt ingot, limits and procedures should be established by the CHM source to \\ncontrol the following: \\n1. hearth design and assembly and set up of the associated equipment, 2. method of removing the skull from the hearth, storage of the skull to prevent contamination, \\nprovisions for retiring the skull and traceability of the skull back to previous melts, \\n3. molten pool dimensions during steady state melting, 4. molten pool temperature during steady state melting, 5. chamber leak-up rate, \\n6. chamber pressure, \\n7. melting (ingot casting) rate, \\n8. cooling cycle and atmosphere, 9. melt interruptions, \\n10. chamber and raw material feed cleaning, and \\n11. input material feed practice. (b) Additional Electron Beam Melt Parameter Controls. In addition to the controls listed in \\n7.c.(2)(a) (Critical Parameters for EBM and PAM), the EBM CHM source should also establish \\nprocedures to control the following: \\n1. electron beam power, deflection pattern, beam diffusion and scanning frequency, \\n2. duration of beam interruption, and the restart procedure, and \\n3. condensate control and fall-in. (c) Additional Plasma Arc Melt Parameter Controls. In addition to the controls listed in \\n7.c.(2)(a) (Critical Parameters for EBM and PAM), the PAM CHM source should also establish \\nprocedures to control the following: \\n1. torch gas type and flow rate, \\n2. torch voltage, current, motion pattern, velocity and position, \\n3. hydrogen, oxygen and moisture control in the chamber and torch gas, and 4. duration of arc interruption, and the restart procedure. d. Intermediate And Final Melts. The final melt should be by the VAR process following either a \\nprimary melt by the VAR or CHM process, or an intermediate VAR melt in the case of a three \\nVAR process. \\n(1) Multiple VAR or CHM Plus VAR Process. Controls should be applied to the melting process \\nto ensure consistency in the melting parameters and, hence, in the ingot product. It is \\nadvisable to restrict furnaces and crucibles used for primary melt from being used for the \\nsecond and third melt. Cleaning and inspection of crucibles is particularly important for second \\nand final melts, and should be performed to established procedures (reference 7.f.(4), VAR Furnaces). \\n(a) Weld Joining of Electrodes. Melting through a weld should not be permitted in final melting. \\nTherefore, if two ingots are welded together to form a longer electrode, that material shall be \\nmelted twice. Controls on welding should be per paragraph 7.b.(1)(c)1. (Welding). \\n(b) Electrode Cleaning/ Descale/Crown. Prior to remelting, all electrodes should be visually \\ninspected and cleaned. The cleaning method used should thoroughly remove all loose \\nmaterial, foreign material, or any evidence of burnt titanium. In addition, any crown or splatter \\nat the top of the ingot should be removed. Identification and recording of electrode orientation \\nfor each melt should be maintained. \\n(c) Electrode Mechanical/Electrical Attachment. Should be in accordance with 7.b.(1)(d) \\n(Electrode Mechanical/Electrical Attachment). \\n(d) Critical Melt Parameters. The melt supplier should establish a melting sequence to \\nminimize chemical segregation of the ingot. Once a sequence has been adopted, it should be \\nconsistently applied. \\n1. All parameters listed in 7.c.(1)(a) (Critical Parameters) are applicable to the intermediate \\nand final melts. In addition, for final melting, a hot topping procedure should be established. \\nInput power should be reduced in a controlled fashion over a period of time, and the hot top \\nsequence should be recorded. Hot topping should be consistently applied from heat to heat. \\n2. A system should be established to identify the start of the hot topping sequence. If markers \\nare attached to the electrode, or in any manner introduced into the furnace, they should be \\nmanufactured using premium quality titanium of a similar composition and melting point to the \\nalloy being melted. Attachment should prevent markers falling into the melt. Welding of markers for final melt should be prohibited. If machined grooves are used, the tools should be \\nselected to avoid HDI\\'s. \\n3. The hot topping sequence for the final melt should be arranged to terminate before \\nintroduction of any non-premium material into the melt and/or consumption of any welds. This could be done by ensuring that a \\'wafer\\' or \\'platter\\' of electrode is always left unmelted. The \\nfurnace should be opened in a controlled manner to avoid surface contamination. \\ne. Inspection. Ingot inspection procedures should be established by the supplier and approved \\nby the PAH. Inspection procedures relevant to the possible introduction of HID\\'s during the \\nmelt procedure are discussed below. It should be noted that at ingot stage, inspection methods \\nare relatively limited and simple, therefore, primary emphasis should be placed on melt \\nprocess control. Detailed billet inspection procedures are covered in Section 8, Billet \\nConversion, Disk Forging, and NDT. \\n(1) Wafer/Platter Inspection. The residual electrode \\'wafer\\'/\\'platter\\' should be inspected for \\nthickness and color after each VAR melt, and compared to physical or photographic standards. \\nMelting through a weld during final melt should not be permitted. Any indication of abnormal \\ncolor due to oxidation should be investigated, and sources of furnace leaks identified and \\nrepaired prior to processing additional material in the affected furnace. The heat of material from the abnormally discolored wafer should not be used for premium grade applications. \\n(2) Ingot Inspection. All electrodes and final ingots should be inspected for color and surface \\ncondition and processed as detailed in 7.d(1)(b) (Electrode Cleaning/ Descale/Crown). Ingots \\nexhibiting abnormal surface condition (excessive oxidation) indicative of furnace coolant or air \\nleaks, should not be released for premium grade applications, and additional material should \\nnot be processed in the affected furnace until the leak source has been identified and repaired. \\n(a) Exposed pipe should not be permitted on final ingots. The location of internal pipe should \\nbe determined by an inspection technique or by process history to allow appropriate inspection \\nand disposition of the pipe-affected material during or following the subsequent \\nconversion/cropping process. \\nf. Equipment Maintenance And Cleaning. TIG welds, original or repair, are considered \\nundesirable on equipment surfaces in contact with sponge, raw materials, or other inprocess \\nmaterial. \\n(1) Blending. Equipment used for blending should be maintained in areas isolated from \\npotential sources of contamination likely to cause HDI\\'s or HID\\'s (e.g., carbide tools, welding \\noperations, etc.). All processing equipment should be regularly cleaned and inspected to written procedures. Procedures should specify methods of cleaning and frequency. \\n(2) Compaction. Compaction equipment (i.e., tooling, handling, etc.) should be maintained in a \\nclean contamination-free environment. Tools should be regularly cleaned and inspected to \\nestablished written procedures. \\n(3) Electrode Fabrication. Procedures should be established for thoroughly cleaning and \\ninspecting the interior of the welding chamber, fixtures, welding equipment, etc., to assure all \\nsurfaces are free of all contaminants known to cause HDI\\'s and HID\\'s. Procedures should be \\nspecific to what is cleaned, how, at what frequency, and how it is inspected. At a minimum, \\nchambers should be visually inspected before electrode is welded. \\n(4) VAR Furnaces \\n(a) Furnace Cleaning. Procedures should be established for thoroughly cleaning and \\ninspecting the interiors of all melt furnaces. Base plates, stubs, covers and seals should be \\nfree of all contaminants known to cause HID\\'s and HDI\\'s. Procedures should specify cleaning \\nfrequency, method of cleaning, and methods of inspection. \\n(b) Crucible Cleaning. Procedures should be established to clean and inspect the inside \\nsurfaces of crucibles before each melt. Examples include tumbling with some hard medium, \\nwire brushing, water jets, etc. The system chosen should be capable of removing any surface contaminant which could cause an HID or HDI. Each crucible should be inspected to a written \\nprocedure prior to release for assembly into a furnace melt sequence. After cleaning and \\ninspection, crucibles should be stored in a manner to minimize possible contamination, and a \\nfinal visual inspection is prudent prior to sealing the furnace for melting. \\n(c) Leak-Up Rate Checks. After the furnace assembly is sealed, but prior to melting, the \\nsystem should be checked to written procedures to ensure that requirements for leak-up rate \\ncan be met. Results should be recorded. \\n(5) CHM Furnaces. \\n(a) Furnace Cleaning. Procedures should be established by the CHM source for thoroughly \\ncleaning and inspecting the interior of the melt furnace, the hearth, barriers, spray shields and all associated equipment used on the interior of the furnace prior to use, to assure that they \\nare free of all contaminants known to cause HDI\\'s and HID\\'s. Procedures should be specific as \\nto what is cleaned, how it is cleaned and the frequency of cleaning. At a minimum, cleaning \\nshould be done when the melt chamber is exposed to air, between alloy type or alloy quality \\nchanges, and after a contaminated melt. \\n(b) Ingot Mold Cleaning. Procedures should be established to assure that the mold and \\nbase/ puller assembly are thoroughly cleaned and inspected prior to each melt. \\n(c) Feed Mechanism. Procedures should be established to assure that all raw material feed mechanisms are cleaned and inspected to preclude contamination prior to melting. \\n(d) Skull Maintenance. Care should be used and procedures should be established to assure \\nthat skulls that are going to be reused are cleaned and not contaminated during removal, \\nstorage or reassembly. Only skulls of like alloy and quality from a non-contaminated melt \\nshould be reused. Skulls should have traceability to previous melts and should be inspected \\nprior to reuse to assure that no loose contaminants are present. \\n8. BILLET CONVERSION, DISK FORGING, AND NDT. \\na. Control Of Billet Manufacture. \\n(1) Conversion Process. Specific detailed procedures should exist for the conversion of ingot \\nto billet and bar products. These include but are not necessarily limited to: \\n(a) Billet Conversion. Ingot to billet conversion should be performed using controlled, \\nconsistent, and detailed procedures. \\n1. Forge Parameter Control. Documented procedures to control ingot and billet products \\nshould be developed and used. These procedures include, but are not limited to: \\n(i) forge furnace temperatures/atmospheres (ii) soak times \\n(iii) amount of draft \\n(iv) reduction schedules/sequences (v) quench time, media, and methods (vi) die type (vii) single or double end procedures \\n(viii) off-die procedures \\n2. Forge Practice. Forge practices should be developed which preclude formation of strain \\ninduced porosity (SIP) or clean voids. \\n3. Records. Reduction sizes, sequences, and temperature records should be maintained. (b) Traceability. Traceability of billet to exact ingot location should be maintained. \\n(2) Cropping. Any ingot conversion should incorporate a crop of the ingot extremities. Limits for \\ncrop lengths should be established to account for the bottom charge and hot topping \\nprocedures used for the final melting. \\nb. Control Of Disk/Component Manufacture. \\n(1) Forging/Heat Treatment Process. Specific detailed procedures should exist for the \\nproduction of finished rotating components from billet product. These should include but not \\nnecessarily be limited to: \\n(a) Forging Controls. Controlled, consistent, and detailed procedures should be established for \\nthe control of the forging press/hammer processing. \\n(b) Thermal Controls. Documented procedures for control of forge/soaking furnace \\ntemperature and times should be established. \\n(c) Heat Treatment Controls. Documented procedures should be established for the control of \\nheat treatment furnaces, atmospheres, times and temperatures. \\n(d) Quenching. Quench practice and cooling rates should be controlled to ensure freedom from \\nquench related cracking. \\n(e) Traceability. Traceability of forgings to exact billet location should be maintained. \\n(2) Records. Reduction sizes, sequences, and temperature records should be maintained. c. Nondestructive Testing (NDT) And Criteria. (1) NDT. In order to obtain further confidence that titanium rotating parts are free from \\npotentially detrimental anomalies, NDT should be performed at appropriate stages throughout \\nbillet/bar and component manufacture. NDT requirements will typically include but not \\nnecessarily be limited to the following: \\n(a) Billet/Bar. 1. Ultrasonic. Immersion ultrasonic testing of billet/bar should be performed. 2. Macroetch. Macroetch inspection of billet/bar ends adjacent to ultrasonic crops should be \\ndone to assure freedom of the remaining material from segregation or other anomalies. \\n(b) Forging. \\n1. Ultrasonic. Immersion ultrasonic testing of forgings should be performed. \\n2. Macroetch. Sonic or intermediate machined forgings may be macroetched for examination \\nfor the presence of segregation or other anomalies. (c) Finish Machined Component. \\n1. Etch. Finish machined components should have their surfaces blue etch anodized and \\ninspected to assure freedom from segregates. Alternate suitable macroetch procedures, \\nalthough not preferred, may be utilized. \\n2. Fluorescent Penetrant Inspection. Finish machined components should be fluorescent \\npenetrant inspected. \\n(2) Ultrasonic Testing (UT) Criteria. The criteria for UT of billet/bar and forgings should \\nconsider the operational and control requirements that materials/ultrasonic inspection systems \\nmust achieve. The criteria should include but not necessarily be limited to the following: \\n(a) System Variability. Materials systems from billet/bar through forging, heat treatment, and \\nmachining should be engineered such that materials-generated ultrasonic noise or boundary (surface finish) ultrasound transmission characteristics do not interfere with detectability of \\npotentially detrimental anomalies. Periodic system reliability/repeatability studies should be conducted to assure instrumentation and standards are functioning properly and within \\ncalibration. \\n(b) Test Blocks. Test blocks used to verify operation of the ultrasonic inspection system should \\nbe representative of the part being inspected and should contain appropriate ultrasonic \\nreference standards (flat bottom holes or side drilled holes). The ultrasonic reference \\nstandards should be correlated with potentially detrimental anomalies. \\n(3) Statistical Assessment. Statistical assessment of factors responsible for material/ultrasonic \\nsystem variability should be conducted. \\n(4) Acceptance Limit. When using automated scanning systems, the acceptance limit should \\nbe set appropriately above the noise level to minimize false calls while maintaining detection sensitivity consistent with design requirements. \\n(5) Records. Strip charts or equivalent electronic data should be required and retained \\naccording to the engine-manufacturer\\'s FAA-approved records retention schedule. \\nd. Actions Following Indication Detection. \\n(1) Indication Characterization. Characterization of unacceptable indications should be \\nconducted on billet/bar, forgings or finished parts, as appropriate, and reported to JETQC in \\naccordance to JETQC practices. This characterization, as appropriate and as a minimum, shall provide the following information \\n(The recommended procedure for 3D inclusion characterization is outlined in Appendix 1.): \\n(a) Defect type \\n(b) 3D defect size (c) 3D void/crack size if any (d) Microhardness (e) Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) evaluation: nature of constituents, fractography of \\nvoid/crack (f) Microprobe analysis: Chemical composition of defect, nature of inclusions (g) Photomicrographs of the defect in two perpendicular directions \\n(2) Indications Detected In Billet/Bar. \\n(a) HDI or HID. Any heat which is shown, by billet/bar inspection and indication \\ncharacterization, to contain an HDI or HID inclusion should be rejected for critical rotating part \\napplication. \\n(b) Other. HAD\\'s and clean voids are considered potentially detrimental; usage of heats shown \\nto contain any of these anomalies should be evaluated on an individual basis. \\n(3) Indications Detected in Forgings And Finished Parts. The PAH should take appropriate \\naction upon finding and characterizing unacceptable indications in forgings and finished parts. \\nAction regarding suspect material should be based on historic experience with the process and may include, but not necessarily be limited to, overinspections of parts from heats, lots, \\nbatches, etc., which contain the forging or part with the anomaly. \\n(4) Associated Heats. Associated heats shall be identified and investigated for potential similar \\ndefects. \\nOriginal signed by:\\n \\nJay J.

Purpose. \\na. This advisory circular (AC) provides definitions, guidance, and acceptable methods, but \\nnot the only methods, that may be used to de monstrate compliance with requirements in § 33.70 \\nof Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations related to the integrity of engine life-limited parts. \\nSection 33.70 contains requirements applicable to the design and life management of propulsion \\nsystem life-limited parts, includ ing high-energy rotating parts.   \\nb. This AC presents a damage tolerance approach which can be used to address \\nmanufacturing and operationa lly-induced anomalies in turbine e ngine rotating part hole features. \\nThis approach can be readily integrated with  the existing “safe-life” process for high-energy \\nrotors to produce an enhanced life management process. This approach does not replace existing safe-life methodology but supplements it. In the c ontext of damage tolerance, this AC is not \\nintended to allow operation beyond the component manual life limit set using the existing safe-\\nlife approach which limits the useful rotor life to  the minimum number of flight cycles required \\nto initiate a crack. Rotor failure modes for whic h full containment of high-energy debris can be \\ndemonstrated are excluded from the procedures outlined in this AC and need not be accounted \\nfor in the overall risk assessment. \\n2. Applicability. \\na. The guidance provided in this document is directed to engine manufacturers, modifiers, \\nforeign regulatory authorities,  part manufacturers who hold Pa rts Manufacturer Approval (PMA) \\nauthority, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designated engineer ing representatives. \\nWithin this AC the term “engine manufacturer” refers to any person who holds a design approval \\nof an engine life-limited part. \\ni \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n          \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor re gulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes acceptable means, but no t the only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations. We (“the FAA”) will consider other methods an applicant may \\npresent to demonstrate compliance. Terms such as  “should,” “shall,” “may,” and “must” are used \\nonly in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the \\nmethod in this document is used. While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in  determining compliance with the relevant \\nregulations. If we find that follo wing this AC would not result in  compliance with the applicable \\nregulations, we will not be bound by this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance. \\nc.

Failure of rotating \\nparts usually results in the non-containment of high-energy debris, which is the primary hazardous engine effect addressed by this AC. Disks, hubs, impellers, large rotating seals, and \\nother similar large rotating components represen t potential sources of  high-energy debris. \\nl. Hole Feature . A set of one or more circular hole s at the same axial and radial location \\nwhere any given hole falls at leas t partially within the circumferential (diametral) shadow of the \\nlargest hole and its size is greater  than 75 percent of the diamet er of the largest hole.

Results from these \\nanalyses are typically used for design optimizatio n to meet a predefined target or to conduct \\nparametric studies. This type of procedure differs from an absolute  risk analysis, which attempts \\nto consider all significant variables and is used  to quantify, on an absolu te basis, the predicted \\nnumber of future events with sa fety and reliability consequences. \\nw.

A low cycle fatigue-based process in which life-limited components are \\ndesigned, manufactured, and substantiated to have a specified service life or life limit, which is \\nstated in operating flight cycles , operating hours, or both.

As required by § 33.70(a), applicants mu st perform appropriate damage tolerance \\nassessments to address the potential for failure from material, manu facturing, and service \\ninduced anomalies within the approved life of the part. This is necessary because service \\nexperience with gas turbine engines has demonstr ated that material, manufacturing and service-\\ninduced anomalies do occur, and they can potential ly degrade the structural integrity of rotor \\nlife-limited parts. Several approaches are current ly available to address this requirement and \\nhave been introduced by AC 33.70-1 and AC 33.1 4-1. The methodology described in Chapter 2 \\nof this AC was first introduced in AC 33.14-1 to  address the potential presence of hard alpha \\nanomalies in titanium rotors. \\nb. The complex and time-consuming nature of the effort required to develop the technical \\nelements associated with this method—for example, data collection, analysis, methodology \\ndevelopment, acceptable design targets, and validation—has led to a decision to introduce the surface damage tolerance assessment methodology for manufacturing and in-service anomalies in phases. Phase 1 of this methodology, introduce d in this AC, presents a damage tolerance \\napproach which can be used to address manufac turing and operationally-induced anomalies in \\ncircular hole features (see Appendix 5) in rotor parts. We will introduce other phases in future \\nACs that will address the remaining surface features.   \\nFrancis A.

ENHANCED LIFE MANAGEMENT PROCESS \\n1. Based on historical experience, the safe- life philosophy has worked  well and provides a \\nsolid base for further enhancement. Modificatio ns to the industry standard life management \\nprocedures should augment, not replace, curren t approaches, which are based on the safe-life \\nphilosophy. \\na. A new element, damage tolerance, has been added to the ex isting conventional life \\nmanagement process to define the enhanced life management process. We expect enhanced life \\nmanagement to further minimize the occurrence of  uncontained rotor failures and thus improve \\nflight safety (see figure 1-1). \\nb. Use of the enhanced life management pr ocess, shown in figure 1-1, will result in \\ndamage tolerance assessments being conducted on cr itical rotating part designs. These will be in \\nthe form of fracture-mechanics-based probabilistic risk assessments, the results of which will be \\ncompared to specified design target risk values . Designs that satisfy these DTR values will be \\nconsidered in compliance with the damage tolerance requirements of § 33.70. Engine \\nmanufacturers will have a variety of options available to achieve the DTR. These options \\ninclude, but are not limited to: \\n• component redesign, \\n• material changes, \\n• material process improvements, \\n• manufacturing process improvements, \\n• manufacturing inspection improvements, \\n• enhanced in-service inspections, and  \\n• life limit reductions. \\n     \\n \\n \\n 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nFigure 1-1: Enhanced Life Management Process \\nSafe Life \\nPrediction \\nLife Management \\nProcess \\nDevelopment \\n& Validation \\nTes t s Methods & \\nMaterial \\nData \\nService Life \\n& Product \\nAssurance Damage \\nTol er anc e \\nAssessment New Element\\n \\nAdded to\\n \\nExisting Safe\\n \\nLife Process\\n \\n2 \\n\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nCHAPTER 2.  DAMAGE TOLERANCE ASSESSMENTS \\n1. Approach . \\na. As described in AC 33.70-1, Probabilistic Damage Tolerance Risk Assessments \\n(PDTRA) is an acceptable method to assess the ability of a part to tolerate anomalies. The results of these assessments will provi de the basis for evaluating th e relative damage tolerance \\ncapabilities of candidate part designs and will al so allow the engine manufacturer to balance its \\ndesigns for both enhanced reliabil ity and customer impact. The results will be compared against \\ndesign target risk values (see paragraph 6, “D esign Target Risk,” in this chapter).   \\nb. The need for further risk reducing actions  on the part of the engine manufacturer is \\nbased on whether the design under consideration satis fies the desired DTR values. If the targets \\nare met, then the design is in compliance with § 33.70. The manufacturer has a variety of options \\navailable to achieve the required DTR and ma y conduct quantitative parametric studies to \\ndetermine the influence of key variables such  as inspection methods, inspection frequency, \\nhardware geometry, hardware processing, mate rial selection and lif e limit reduction. The \\nmanufacturer may make changes to the design, or field manageme nt of the part, or both, to \\nachieve the DTR values. \\nc. PDTRA will usually be performed during the engine component detail design phase.  \\nParagraph 2 of this chapter defines an asse ssment methodology applicable to manufacturing and \\nservice-induced anomalies and pr ovides a process to refine a design to achieve the desired DTR \\nvalues. \\n2. Methodology. \\na. Probabilistic risk assess ments may be conducted using a variety of methods, such as \\nMonte Carlo simulation or numeri cal integration techniques. When  performing a PDTRA, use of \\nthe standardized inputs and default data presente d in this AC will achieve consistent assessment \\nresults. \\nb. A list of standardized inputs is provided under paragraph “c” below. Default input data \\nis described in paragraphs 3 and 4 of this chapte r.  Use of this defau lt data in probabilistic \\nassessments requires no further demonstration of applicability or accuracy. However, when this \\ndata is used, the applicant should follow the guidelines accompanying this data to ensure applicability. Use of inputs other than these default values may require additional validation to verify applicability, adequacy, and accuracy. \\nc. Probabilistic risk assessments should inco rporate the following inputs as part of a basic \\nanalysis: component stress, surf ace area, material properties, cr ack growth (propagation) life, \\nanomaly distribution, design serv ice life, inspection PODs, an d maintenance exposure rate. \\n(1) Input. The following data sets are defined as basic input elements. \\n(a) Stress. This variable influences crack propagation life. Data input should \\nencompass the most limiting operational principa l stresses.  Engine cycle(s) for design LCF \\ncertification, or actual usage (i f known), should be used to es tablish the stress distribution. \\n3 \\n\\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nSurface assessments should incorporate the a ppropriate surface and near surface stress \\ndistributions, including the effects of stress  concentrations and vibratory stresses.   \\nNote: The method described in this AC  has been calibrated against industry \\nexperience without considering the effect  of shot peening and the resulting \\nbeneficial residual stresses on the crack propagation lives. As a result, with this \\nmethod it is inappropriate to include the beneficial effects of shot peening. \\n(b) Surface Area. This variable influences the probability of having a \\nmanufacturing-induced anomaly on the surface of  a specific component/component feature. For \\nhole features, this corresponds to the total surface area of on e hole in a given feature.  \\n(c) Material Cyclic Crack Growth Rate (CCGR) Data.  Use average crack growth \\nrate properties of the base material as the de fault condition to calculate  crack propagation life. \\n(d) Propagation Life. Nu mber of cycles for a given size anomaly to grow to a \\ncritical size. This is based on knowledge of pa rt stresses, including th e vibratory stresses, \\ntemperature, geometry, stress gradient, anomaly orientation, and material  properties. Linear \\nelastic fracture mechanics should be used fo r the calculation of propagation life. Default \\nconditions should assume anomalies to be in the worst orientation to the stress field. \\n(e) Anomaly Distribution .  For manufacturing-induced assessments, use the \\ndefault anomaly distributions outlined in paragraph 3 of this chapter or FAA-approved company-\\nspecific data. Company-specific da ta should be developed using the same process employed to \\nderive the default anomaly dist ributions.  For manufacturing-induced anomaly assessments, this \\nprocess is described in a technical paper titled “Development of Anomaly Distributions for \\nMachined Holes in Aircraft Engine Rotors” - see paragraph b.(2) in “References and Related \\nReading.” The paper also describes the process required to establish the potential benefits (e.g., \\nreduced anomaly size/frequency distributions) derived from the imposition of enhanced surface inspections during the manufacturing process. Note: In all assessments, anomalies will be treated as sharp propagating cracks from the first stress cycle. \\n(f) POD. Default PODs and instructio ns on use of individual company values are \\ncontained in paragraph 5 of this chapter. Fo r surface assessments, consider the effects of \\nfluorescent penetrant in spection (FPI) and eddy current in spection (ECI) as appropriate. \\n(g) Maintenance Exposure Interval. For the purpose of assessing inspection \\nbenefits, model exposure interval curves for the engine, module, or component in question in the \\nanalysis. \\n(2) Calibration.\\n (a) Each engine manufacturer should ca librate its analytical  prediction tools by \\nconducting the industry test cas e detailed in Appendix 1.   \\n(b) The manufacturing-induced anomal y test case in Appendix 1 consists of a \\nprobabilistic analysis of a simulated titanium ring disk with a row of ½\" diameter holes, using \\nspecified inputs and scenarios. Test case resu lts in the ranges from 2.58E-04 to 3.22E-04 events \\n4 \\n\\n     \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nwithin the service life of the part (for the “no inspection” case) and from 7.29E-05 to 2.25E-04 \\n(for the “with in-service inspecti on” case) are considered acceptable.  Test case results outside of \\nthese ranges may indicate deficiencies with either  the probabilistic assessment technique or the \\nassumptions made. \\n(3) Output: Manufacturing-Induced Anomaly Assessments.  Holes.   \\n(a) Applicability. This pr ocedure applies to ci rcular holes in rotor life-limited parts \\nwith the exception of the bore hole. The bore hole is specifically exempted because the \\nmachining anomalies observed in field events originating at the bore hole do not resemble the \\nanomaly types observed in drilled hole features, which suggests different damage mechanisms. \\n(b) Hole Feature Assessments.  The probabilistic assessments and prediction of \\nevent potential for a given hole feature should be calculated over the enti re anticipated service \\nlife of the part. This result should be expressed as the number of  predicted events for each cycle \\nand should be designated as the predicted “hole feature event rate.” The predicted hole feature \\nevent rate should then be compared to the hole feature level DTR value to assess design \\nacceptability.  \\n(4) General Comments. \\n(a) The FAA encourages engine manufac turers to incorporate fracture resistant \\ndesign concepts where possible. Credit may be gi ven for fracture resistant or burst resistant \\nengine design features, which cl early demonstrate, through both an alysis and test, a reduction in \\nthe potential for rotor failure due to the presen ce of unanticipated anom alies. Credit may be \\ndetermined using the probabilistic risk assessment methods contained with this AC and by data \\nwhich supports the fracture resi stant features of the design. \\n(b) Because the design of an aircraft turbine engine rotor is a lengthy process \\ninvolving numerous iterations, each of which can s ubstantially alter the initi al design risk value, \\nit is important that the design feature satisfy th e appropriate DTR value at the time of engine \\ncertification. Some risk assessments will be c onducted several years after the engine enters \\nservice due to in-service problems, changes in en gine service usage, improvements in analytical \\npredictive tools, or change s in engine component materials. In these instances, it is important to \\nnote that the DTR values should be satisfi ed throughout the life of the hardware. \\n(c) Etch inspection is widely used in the industry to evaluate  material quality on \\nrotor part surfaces. While etch inspections ar e not yet included in the damage tolerance \\nassessment, they have been identified as the foremost means of detecting non-geometric \\nanomalies (worked layers) in holes by the FAA Report number DOT/FAA/AR-06/3 “Guidelines \\nto Minimize Manufacturing Induced Anomalies in rotor life limited parts” – see paragraph a.(3) \\nin “References and Related Reading.” As such, etch inspections curren tly in-place perform a \\nvital role and should not be discontinued because of any damage tolerance analysis set forth in \\nthis AC. \\n(d) Crack propagation assessment guidelin es for consistent treatment of out of \\nphase stress vs. temperature history are included below.  These guidelines apply only to the \\nprobabilistic damage tolerance analysis. \\n5 \\n\\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\n1  Crack propagation under out-of-phase stress vs. temperature transient \\nloadings is a complex phenomenon.  Compared to isothermal tests, non-isothermal experimental \\nresults suggest that the crack propagation rate ca n be higher than predicte d at the temperature of \\nthe maximum stress when the maximum temperat ure during the flight is greater than the \\ntemperature at the maximum stress (see figure 2-1). \\n2  While some OEMs have developed m odels to predict this phenomenon, no \\nindustry standard is yet available. \\n3  The following design guidelines pr ovide a default approach for the \\nprobabilistic analysis de scribed in this AC. \\n4  Design Guidelines (Default Option).  These are not intended to become a \\ngeneral industry standard. For the major and minor stress cycles over the full flight, the \\ntemperature to consider is the most life limiting between:  \\n• Temperature at maximum stress during the cycle, and \\n• Maximum temperature during the flight \\n5  Design Guidelines (Alternative Option).  A crack propagation model \\naccounting for out of phase temperature vs. stress history for the full flight can be used if it is \\nvalidated with the OEM laboratory and fiel d experience on the considered material. \\nFigure 2-1.

Anomaly Distributions . \\na. A key input distribution a ssociated with PDTRA assessments is the size and rate of \\noccurrence of the anomalies. This type of information is statistica l in nature and can be presented \\nin a form that specifies the number of anomalie s that exceed a particular  size in a given amount \\nof surface area. \\nb. Manufacturing-Induced Anomaly Distributions.\\n (1) Manufacturing-induced anomaly distributions  that apply to circul ar hole features in \\ndisks have been developed to characterize the si ze (depth) distribution and frequency of said \\nanomalies (see Appendix 2). The distributions apply to circular holes machined in titanium, steel, \\nnickel, or powder nickel rotor components.  \\n(2) The anomaly distributions contained in Appendix 2 may be used to determine \\ncompliance with paragraph 6 (“Design Target Risk”) of this chapter. The background pertaining \\nto the development of these distributions is co ntained in the technical paper “Development of \\nAnomaly Distributions for Machined Holes in Airc raft Engine Rotors.” The distributions were \\ndeveloped by modeling crack sizes detected during component/engine te sting or through in-\\nservice experience using an EIFS (Effective Initia l Flaw Size) approach. The final distributions \\nwere validated based on OEM field experience. This process resulted in a probability of exceedance curve (see figure A2-1) that can be used to determine a relative risk reduction but not an absolute level of risk. \\n(3) Individual engine manufacturers who wa nt to use an alternate anomaly distribution \\nor an improved inspection capability, or extend the PDTRA process to features other than \\ncircular holes should use a methodology similar to that contained in the paper “Development of \\nAnomaly Distributions for Machined Holes in Ai rcraft Engine Rotors.” This paper contains \\ninstructions on how to develop an alternate di stribution, which must be substantiated by the \\nappropriate background data. Alte rnate manufacturing-induced a nomaly distributions should: \\n(a) include fracture and crack find data, \\n(b) include inspection POD data, and \\n(c) be based upon substantial field experience. \\n4. Manufacturing Credits Applicable to Ma nufacturing-Induced Anomaly Distributions . \\na. To encourage the use of best practices wh en manufacturing circular  holes in rotor life-\\nlimited parts, a process has been established to  take credit for available manufacturing process \\nvalidation and controls that reduce the risk of  hole damage during manufacture. This process \\nincludes: \\n(1) Process validation to a modern standard as described in FAA Report number \\nDOT/FAA/AR-06/3. \\n7 \\n\\n     \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  33.70-2 8/28/09 \\n(2) Single point boring as a me thod of finishing a hole.  This  is restricted to titanium \\nalloys. \\n(3) Honing all alloys as a method of finishing a hole. \\n(4) The provision of a coolant monitor to  ensure the flow of  coolant towards the \\ncutting edge. \\n(5) Power monitoring to a standard  detailed in the FAA Report number \\nDOT/FAA/AR-06/3. \\n(6) Other process monitoring, including feed force, vibrati on, etc., to a standard similar \\nto that for power monitoring above. \\n(7) Inspection for detecti on of non-geometric anomalies. \\nb. The degree of allowable manufacturing cred it is a function of which of the above \\navailable actions are actually em ployed during hole making. Calcula tion of manufacturing credit \\nis outlined in Appendix 6. The manufacturing-in duced probabilistic damage tolerance approach \\nhas been developed excluding the benefits of enhanced manufacturing validation and process \\ncontrols.  Hence, the credit is a pplied as a reduction f actor to the results of the manufacturing-\\ninduced probabilistic assessments prior to  comparing with the hole feature DTR.  \\n5. Default Input - Nondestructive Evaluation (NDE) POD . \\na. Detection of non-geometric anomalies, such as highly distorted grai n structure, white or \\namorphous layer, and bent grain, which have domin ated the experience of cracking in rotors, is \\nquite distinct from detecting cracks and geometric anomalies such as nicks or dents. Cracks that may develop from non-geometric anomalies can be detected by conventional methods, such as eddy current, penetrant or ultrasonic inspection, wh en the part is inspecte d at shop visit. These \\nmethods, however, may be of very limited benefit at new manufacture. If credit for inspection at \\nnew manufacture is claimed, applicants must dem onstrate that the capability of the technique on \\nthe target anomaly types.  The de fault POD data supplied in this AC in Appendix 4 only refers to \\nthe detection of cracks. \\nb. The capability of individual NDE proce sses, such as eddy current, penetrant, or \\nultrasonic inspection, for th e detection of local material anom alies (discontinuities or potential \\nanomalies), is a function of numerous parameters , including the size, shap e, orientation, location, \\nand chemical or metallurgical character of the anomaly. In addition, the following four \\nparameters should be considered when asse ssing the capabilities of an NDE process: \\n(1) The material being inspected (for example, its composition, grain size, conductivity, \\nand surface texture). \\n(2) The inspection materials or instrumenta tion (for example, the specific penetrant and \\ndeveloper, the inspection frequency, instrument bandwidth and linearity). \\n(3) The inspection parameters such as scan index. \\n8 \\n\\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\n(4) The inspector (for example, his or her visual acuity, atten tion span, and training). \\nc. The “default” POD data supplied with this AC are characteristic of inspection capability \\nthat has been measured under typical, well-cont rolled conditions. These default POD values are \\nprovided primarily to facilitate selection of nondestructive inspection t echniques that are best \\nsuited to support attainment of  damage tolerant inspections . Manufacturers should recognize, \\nhowever, that although properly app lied inspections should result in capability similar to these \\ndefault values, they are strictly  applicable only under the co nditions under which they were \\nacquired (see Appendix 3). POD curves are descri bed in Appendix 4, figures A4-1 and A4-2, as \\nlisted below: \\n(1) Appendix 4, Figure A4-1 . Mean POD for Fluorescen t Penetrant Inspection of \\nFinish-Machined Surfaces. \\n(2) Appendix 4, Figure A4-2 . Mean POD for Eddy Current Inspection of Finish \\nMachined Surfaces. \\nNOTE: Refer to Appendix 1 for an exam ple of the use of this data and to \\nAppendix 3 for the NDE Applicability of these POD curves. \\n6. Design Target Risk . \\na. The DTR is a benchmark relative risk leve l selected to enhance the overall safety of \\nhigh-energy rotating components. Since no machin e or device is 100-pe rcent reliable, it is \\ninappropriate to require a level th at is technologically unachievabl e. Nevertheless, the goal is to \\nachieve a significant and dis tinct improvement over and ab ove current rotor designs. \\nb. For manufacturing-induced anomaly asse ssments, designs must meet the specified \\nfeature DTR to be considered acceptable. (Note: Only circular hole feature assessments and \\nDTR’s are currently available.) \\nc. Design Target Risk values are specified in Table 2-1 below: \\nTable 2-1.

Approach . The overall life management process encompasses a wide spectrum of design, \\nmanufacturing, and product support i ssues.  This section addresses onl y one facet of that process, \\nthe assurance of structural inte grity using inspection techniques  and intervals derived from a \\ndamage tolerance (fracture mechanics-based) as sessment. The inspection philosophy is intended \\nsolely to protect against anom alous conditions. It is not inte nded to allow operation beyond the \\nsafe-life limit specified in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness. \\na. When probabilistic assessment indicates risk levels greater than the desired target, many \\nstrategies can be used to reduce the predicted risk to the appropriate level.  However, only the in-\\nservice inspection optio n is addressed here. \\nb. The industry data on uncontained fracture experience summarized in SAE reports AIR \\n1537 (1959 through 1975), AIR 4003 (1976 thro ugh 1983), and SP1270 (1984 through 1989) \\nwas used to guide the development of the insp ection philosophy. These reports indicate that \\nmaintenance-induced uncontained failure rates were comparable to the failure rates for \\nanomalous conditions (material a nd manufacture). This data sugge sts that additional inspection \\nrequirements, if not properly integrated into the normal maintenance scheduled for the engine, \\nwould have no net benefit to re duce uncontained failure rates. \\nc. The inspection philosophy presented here ev olved from the desire to easily integrate \\ninspections into the operation of the engine yet still achieve measurable reduction in the \\nuncontained failure rates. The inspection philoso phy advocates the use of opportunity inspections \\nrather than forced inspections at ‘not to ex ceed’ intervals. These opportunity inspections occur \\ndue to the ‘on-condition’ main tenance practices used by opera tors today. Although opportunity \\ninspections occur at random intervals, they can be treated statistically and used effectively to \\nlower the calculated risk of an uncontained event. \\nd. Opportunity inspection refers to those in stances when the hardware in question is \\navailable in a form such that the specified inspection can be performed. This condition is \\ngenerally viewed as being reduced to the piece part; however; opportunity inspections can be performed on assembled modules. For example, an ECI of a disk bore may be specified on an assembled module whenever the module is avai lable. This inspection is an opportunity \\ninspection based upon module availability ra ther than piece part availability.  \\ne. Whenever possible, the designs should use opportunity inspections to meet the DTR \\nlevels. However, in some instances, the probabilis tic analysis may indicate an unacceptable risk \\nlevel when using just opportunity inspections and some additional action may be required to \\nmeet the DTR. One of the options to mitigate th is risk is to force inspection opportunities by \\nspecifying disassembly of modules or engines wh en a cyclic life interval has been exceeded. \\nThere are many options on how to implement forced disassembly. Options range from mandatory engine removal and subsequent teardo wn at not to exceed cyclic limits (“hard-time” \\nlimits) to mandatory module teardown when the na turally occurring module availability exceeds \\nthe specified cyclic life inspecti on interval of one of the part s contained within that module \\n(“soft-time” limits). This AC advocates the use of  the piece part soft- time inspection option and \\n10 \\n\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nonly suggests that forced disassembly of modules be considered wh en it is required to meet the \\nDTR levels. \\nf. The soft-time inspection philosophy reta ins the “on-condition” maintenance practice \\nand minimizes the impact of additional module disassembly. The inspection requirement exists \\nonly after the engine has been removed from the aircraft for a reason other than the inspection \\nitself and is in a sufficient state of disassemb ly to allow access to the module containing the \\ncomponent in question. An available module contai ning a part with Cycles  Since Last Inspection \\n(CSLI) in excess of the soft-time interval must be disassembled to a condition that allows \\ninspection by the procedure spec ified by the engine manufacturer.  The engine manufacturer must \\nevaluate the risk associated with  parts that become available fo r inspection before the soft-time \\ninterval to determine if the CSLI can be reset. \\ng. The maintenance impact of the soft-time intervals should be considered during the \\ndesign phase. Use the probabilistic analysis, summ arized in Chapter 2, along with the anticipated \\nengine removal rate and the module and piece part availability to develop designs that not only \\nachieve the design target but also result in accepta ble soft-time intervals a nd procedures, if such \\naction is required. \\nh. When invoked, the soft-time inspection a pproach establishes interval limits beyond \\nwhich rotor components must be inspected when the rotors are available in modular form. The soft-time inspection requirement is not intended to affect the current practice of forced inspection programs to address safety of flight concerns th at arise in the course of engine operation and \\nmaturation. These safety of flight concerns shou ld continue to be addr essed through aggressive \\ninspection programs, which are communicated using service bulletins.   \\ni. Applicants should recognize that the in spection assumptions made in the probabilistic \\nrisk assessment must be communicated and implemented accurately to the field by using the ALS of the ICA. These assumptions must also be validated by the review of engine removal rates and module and piece part availability da ta. For example, the ALS must call out an eddy \\ncurrent inspection if that was an assumption in se tting the original soft-time interval.  Similarly, \\nthe amount of inspected material should correspo nd to the analysis assumptions.  Likewise, if \\nfield experience suggests that th e opportunity inspecti on intervals are in ex cess of the assumed \\nrates in the probabi listic risk assessment, then  appropriate corrective action, such as a modified \\ninspection plan, is required. \\nj. The soft-time inspection interval a nd reference to the corresponding inspection \\nprocedures must be specified in the ALS of the ICA. This information must be provided for all \\nrotor parts with specified retirement life limits that require any inspection plans beyond opportunity inspections to meet the DTR levels. The required inspection information should also \\nbe included in the individual ALS of the ICA wi th the other rotor inspection requirements. The \\nmanufacturer must also provide necessary information to focus the prescribed inspections to \\nthose areas of highest relative risk. \\n2. Inspection Scenarios . The following scenarios clarify th e action that should be taken at a \\nmaintenance inspection opportunity. Note that the inspection plans may vary for each part, \\ndepending on the outcome of the probabilistic assessments. \\n11 \\n\\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\na. Maintenance Opportunity - Hardware Av ailable For Opportunity  Inspection. Hardware \\navailable in the condition to pe rform the specified opportunity in spection must be inspected by \\nthe procedures specified in the ALS of th e ICA. This is a mandatory inspection.  \\nb. Maintenance Opportunity - Module Below So ft Time Interval. Hardware accessible in \\nthe assembled or partially disassembled module may be nondestructiv ely inspected by the \\nprocedures specified in the ALS of the ICA. The CSLI may be reset to ze ro, provided the engine \\nmanufacturer has assessed the risk impact associ ated with this action. Th is is a discretionary \\ninspection . \\nc. Maintenance Opportunity - Module Above So ft Time Interval. Hardware listed in ALS \\nof the ICA must be made available for nondestruc tive inspection, using the specified procedures.  \\nThis inspection must be performed whenever the module is available and the CSLI for any \\ncontained hardware that exceeds the inspection cycle limit. This is a mandatory inspection. \\n3. Soft Time Inspection Interval Example .

Test Case Input Data . \\na. Problem Description.  The test case geometry (figure A1-1) consists of a titanium ring \\ndisk under simple cyclic loading for 20,000 cy cles. The maximum speed is 5,700 RPM and an \\nexternal pressure load of 33 MP a (4.786 ksi) is applied on the out er diameter to simulate blade \\nloading. The disk contains 40 circular holes of ½ inch (1.27 cm) diameter at a radial location of \\n14.27 inches (36.2458 cm). \\nFigure A1-1 \\nGEOMETRY ROOM TEMPERATURE TEST CYCLE \\nP SPEED \\n5,700 rpm \\nL R1 \\nR2 Rbh \\nRING \\nR1 = 0.425m (16.732 in) L = 0.0254 m (1.00 in) o t\\n \\nR2 = 0.3 m (11.811 in) P = 33.0 Mpa (4.786 Ksi)\\n \\nRbh= 0.3625 m (14.27 in)\\n \\nb. Anomaly distribution curve.   The anomaly distribution is provided in Appendix 2. \\nFinished part manufacturing inspections are fully accounted for in this curve. No additional \\nmodifications are necessary. The anomaly distri bution is defined in terms of depth and is \\ndependent on the Length to Diameter (L/D) ratio  for the hole. The anomaly distributions should \\nbe linearly extrapolated when anomaly sizes ar e required outside the ra nge of data provided. \\nc. POD. The POD curves used to determin e the effect of an in-service inspection are \\ncontained in Appendix 4. The default curves to be used are the Mean (50 percent Confidence) \\nPOD for eddy current inspection of finish-machined surfaces with the reject  level set at one-half \\nthe calibration notch threshold response.

Test Case Analysis Guidelines . Analytical guidelines fo r probabilistic assessments are \\nprovided with the intent to minimize the variations of the manufacturer’s results due to analytical \\nassumptions. The case presented is based on a ty pical surface anomaly probabilistic fracture-\\nmechanics approach. The hole is subdivided into four locations as identified in figure A1-2; the \\n14 \\n\\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 1 \\nrelative risk or probability of fracture (POF) is calculated for each location. Results for the \\nhighest risk location are multiplied by the numbe r of holes and by the surface area per hole to \\narrive at the total hole set POF or relative ris k.  This analytical approach can be broken down \\ninto five basic steps (described furt her in paragraphs “a” through “e” below): \\na. Stress analysis, \\nb. Hole set definition including surface area and number of holes, \\nc. Crack growth model definition, \\nd. Crack growth calculations, and \\ne. Relative risk calculation. \\nFigure A1-2 \\n1 4 \\n3 \\n2 \\na. Stress analysis. The level of mesh refine ment of the part model is left up to the \\nindividual manufacturer’s discretion. However, the manufacturer should take steps to ensure that \\nthe final answer does not change by a significant amount (5-percent on relativ e risk or POF) if a \\nfiner mesh is chosen. The limiting operational principal stress is th e hoop stress. Component \\nstresses are determined in order to perform crack growth analysis. The disk is assumed to be at \\nconstant temperature. There are no thermal stresses. The stress model must include stress \\nconcentration at the hole. \\nNOTE: Typically a Kt would be applied to the rim stress due to the blade slot or a \\n3D model would include th e blade attachment slot. However, it has not been \\nincluded in the test case. \\nb. Hole set definition including surface area and number of holes. Hole sets are defined \\nfurther in Appendix 5. \\nc. Crack growth model definition. Construct cr ack growth models for each of the locations \\ndefined in figure A1-2. \\n15 \\n\\n    \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n   AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 1 \\n(1) Assume a 2:1 crack aspect ratio semi-circular crack for surface cracks, with surface \\nlength (2c) equal to  twice the depth.  \\n(2) Position one surface crack at the center of  the hole at the inner diameter and one at \\nthe center of the hole at the outer diameter. \\nNOTE: In design analysis of engine hardware, position the crack in the life-\\nlimiting location of the entire hole. \\n(3) Assume a 1:1 crack aspect ratio quarte r-circle crack for corner cracks, with surface \\nlength (c) equal to depth (a). \\n(4) The effect of surface enhancement, such as shot-peen, is not considered in the test \\ncase analysis. \\n(5) Position one corner crack at the life-limiting corner of th e hole at the inner diameter \\nand another crack at the life-lim iting corner of the hole at the outer diameter.  See Note in \\nparagraph 3.c.(2) above. \\nd. Crack growth calculations. Perform cr ack growth calculations using the predicted \\nstresses and crack growth rate data to determin e the residual life associat ed with each location.  \\nConduct the calculations for a range  of initial crack sizes to ensu re that the component service \\nlife is covered. The following guidelines apply to the test case crack growth calculations: \\n(1) All anomalies act as sharp propaga ting cracks (no incuba tion life assumed). \\n(2) The cracks are orientated normally to the maximum principal stress at the crack \\norigin. \\n(3) Consider the impact of stress gradie nts.  The stress direction should remain \\nconstant along the stress gradient. Use direct ional stresses normal to the max principal stress \\nplane at the crack origin for the stress gradients.   \\n(4) Use average crack growth data obtai ned in air (instead of in a vacuum). \\n(5) No surface enhancement effects. \\n(6) For surface cracks, consider a surface crack growth co rrection factor in the stress \\nintensity (K) solution. \\n(7) For corner cracks, consider a corner crack growth correction factor in the stress \\nintensity (K) solution. \\ne. Relative risk calculation. \\n(1) The POF for each location is calculated  by integrating the to tal surface area of all \\nthe holes in the feature, anom aly distribution, residual life, an d inspection POD (if applicable) \\nfrom the previous steps (see figure A1-3).  The POF of each hole can be calculated by either an \\n16 \\n\\n    \\n     \\n \\n   AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 1 \\nintegrated probabilistic met hod or a “Monte Carlo” method. In the Monte Carlo method, the \\nnumber of simulations required is  related to the computed risk. The general rule is that the \\nnumber of simulations should be at least 2 orders of magnitude higher than the computed risk. \\nFor example, if risk is 1 failure in 104 parts, the number of samples required is 106. This ensures \\nthat about 100 “failed” parts are involved in the assessment. The results for the limiting location \\nare multiplied by the number of holes in the feature to determine the total feature POF.   \\n(2) The disk probability of fracture will be calculated twice assuming:  (a) no in-\\nservice inspection, and (b) two in -service ECIs; one at 4,000 cycles and another at 8,000 cycles.  \\nThe “with inspection” POF calculations are pe rformed in the same manner as “without \\ninspection,” except the inspection POD data and cycles to inspec tion are included in the risk \\nintegration (see figure A1-4). The inspection P OD curve applies to 100 percent of the hole and \\nthe front and back surface area. Assume that 90 pe rcent of the parts are inspected at 4,000 cycles \\nand an independent 90 percent of the parts ar e inspected at 8,000 cycles. These inspection \\nintervals are provided for example purposes only. Inspection interval s for actual components \\nmay vary.   \\n17 \\n\\n    \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n           \\n  \\n  \\n AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 1 \\n1.E-05 \\n1.E-06 \\n1.E-07 \\n1.E-08 Probability of Exc eedance\\nper Unit Area (1 / in2) Figure A1-3 \\n2004 Default Distribution for Manufacturing Induced \\nAnomalies in Circular Holes \\n0.001 0.010 0.100 \\nDamage Depth (in) \\nRem aining Life Data \\nai \\nCycles σ1 σ2 σ3 σ4 σ5 \\nRisk \\nCalculation \\nService Life # Events per Service \\nLifetime \\n18 \\n\\n    \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n 0.010 0.100\\n Depth (in)AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 1 \\nInspection POD 2004 Default Distribution for Manufacturing Induced \\nAnomalies in Circular Holes \\n1.E-08 1.E-07 1.E-06 1.E-05 \\n0.001 \\nDamage Probability of Exceedance\\nper Unit Area (1 / in2 ) \\nRisk \\nCalculation \\nService Life Events/Service Life \\nRemaining Life Data \\nai \\nCycles \\nFigure A1-4 \\n19 \\n\\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 1 4.

This appendix defines conditions relevant to the use of accepted estimates of the \\nprobability of detection for specific type s of anomalies and specific nondestructive \\nevaluation/inspection techniques, which may be c onsidered as default values when applied under \\nappropriately similar conditions. The conditions defined in this appendix do not necessarily \\nguarantee the validity of these POD values. For example, if inspection parameters, such as \\npenetrant concentration or temperature, are in adequately controlled, the penetrant capability \\nshown in the accompanying figures in Appendix 4 will not be attained, even if the correct penetrant is selected. We recommend use of a written plan for controlling and monitoring \\ninspection processes (see para graph 3 of this appendix). \\nb. If the conditions described for each inspect ion are not satisfied, th e resultant inspection \\ncapability and reliability will be  reduced. Use of the default POD values in Appendix 4 would \\nthen be inappropriate and would result in an overly optimis tic damage tolerance assessment. \\n2. Demonstrations of Inspection Capability. \\na. For eddy current inspection techniques, a default POD curve is provided in Appendix 4. \\nUse of the default POD curve must be based on demonstration that the stated calibration and \\nreject signal levels are attainable on the com ponent being inspected, and, for example, are not \\nprevented by noise or geometrical features. Th e demonstration condition s should be appropriate \\nto the properties of the part inspected that may affect the inspectability, such as surface \\nconditions, depth to be inspected, or proximity to edges. No othe r demonstration of this default \\ncapability is necessary as long as the requirements for the specific inspection technique are \\nsatisfied (see paragraphs 3-5 of this appendix). \\nb. For specific inspection techniques applied under well-controlled c onditions, it might be \\npossible to achieve POD values that are signif icantly better than the default POD values.  \\nManufacturers may take advantage of any such impr oved capability and reliability only if it is \\nsupported by a well-documented demonstrati on program.  Similarly, a well-documented \\ndemonstration program may be necessary to m easure POD values appropriate to specific \\nconditions excluded from those default values  supported by explicit, reasonable assumptions. \\n3. General Restrictions and Applicability . \\na. The inspection process must be well controlled and performed in accordance with \\nacceptable procedures, such as those defined by the engine standard practices manual, and \\nconsistent with good industrial inspection pract ices, such as those de fined by MIL-STD’s or \\nequivalent industry standards. \\nb. Pertinent inspection process parameters such  as coverage, probe indexing, and scanning \\nspeeds (see paragraph 5 of chapter 2, and paragraphs 4-5 of this appendix), should be governed by written procedures. Inspection plans and any inspection fixturing should be designed to minimize human and other sources of variability. \\n25 \\n\\n    \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 3 \\nc. Inspectors must be fully qualified and tr ained for at least one of the following: NAS \\n410/prEN4179, MIL-STD-410, ASNT-TC-1A, ATA-105, or equivalent, and provided with \\nadequate training instructions in the specific inspection method. \\nd. The specified default ECI and FPI POD data apply to all materials. Geometric \\nconditions, such as radii and edges, can create  areas where inspections cannot be accomplished. \\nLimitations also exist relative to depth of pe netration and near surface resolution. Conditions \\nunder which the default POD data were acquired ar e outlined in paragraphs 4-5 of this appendix. \\nSeek advice about the equivalen ce of alternative conditions from those with expertise in NDE. \\nAreas of high compressive residual stress can have negative effects on th e capability of various \\nNDE techniques, most notably penetrant inspection. \\ne. Applicability of the default POD data is limited to components that exhibit no abnormal \\nsurface condition and that have been properly cl eaned for each shop manual requirements. No \\nother special pre-inspection clean ing or polishing is required. \\n4. Restrictions and Applicability:  ECI . \\na. Eddy current inspection is an inspection technique suitable for th e detection of surface \\nor near-surface anomalies.  For the purposes of th is AC, ECI is intended primarily for application \\nto engine-run components.  The default POD data were acquired under the following conditions: \\n• Probes containing absolute coils, with in spection frequency in the range 2-6 MHz. \\n• Probe fixturing is capable of following surface contours of the component being \\ninspected, with adequate control of attitude, lift-off and scan indexing.  Scan direction \\nwas parallel with any uniform feature changes. \\n• Provision was made for automatic recordi ng of the inspection process signals or \\nautomated alarm, or both, when the inspection threshold is exceeded. \\nb. The default POD data apply to surface-conne cted, low-cycle fatigue cracks.  Cracks are \\nassumed to have a 2-to-1 aspect (length:depth) ratio.  Crack sizes are ex pressed in terms of the \\nlength at the surface. Cracks must not be obscured by oxide, contaminants, etc.  Inspected \\nsurfaces should be flat or only moderately curved.  Choice of the appropriate POD curve from those provided must be based on component demonstration of the attainable inspection \\nsensitivity (see paragraph 2 of this appendix). \\n5. Restrictions and Applicability : Penetrant Inspection (PT/FPI) . \\na. PT is an inspection technique suitable fo r detection of anomalie s that are open to the \\ninspected surface.  For the purposes of this AC, PT is intended primarily for application to \\nengine-run components.  The default POD data  were acquired under the following conditions: \\n(1) Fluorescent penetrants were qualified as  level 4 by MIL-I-251 35, or equivalent, and \\nused with dry powder developer (as a minimum). \\n(2) Application of penetrant and deve loper was automated, or for each, standard \\npractices were employed. See, for example, MIL-STD-6866 and AMS-2847. \\n26 \\n\\n    \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 3 \\n(3) Manipulation of the part was possible to present to the inspector an unimpeded \\nview of the surface to be inspected. \\nb. The default POD data apply to surface-conne cted low-cycle fatigue cracks.  Cracks are \\nassumed to have a 2-to-1 aspect (length:depth) ratio.  Crack sizes are ex pressed in terms of the \\nlength at the surface. Cracks must not be obscured by oxide, contaminants, etc.  Inspected \\nsurfaces should be readily visible.  Choice of  the appropriate POD curve from those provided \\nmust be based on whether focused or full field inspection conditions apply, as those terms are \\ndefined in paragraph 4 (“Definitions ”) in the body of this AC.   \\n27 \\n\\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n          AC 33.70-2 8/28/09 \\nAppendix 4 \\nAPPENDIX 4.

MANUFACTURING CREDITS \\n1. This appendix contains the approach for taking credit for enhanced hole making \\nmanufacturing processes in the POF calculations  to meet the bolt hole feature DTR.  These \\ncredits were developed based on experience from a number of engine manufacturers. \\nTable A6-1. Process Controls, Cont rol Definitions and Credit Factor \\nProcess \\ncontrol Definition Credit Factor \\nProcess A procedure in which it is dem onstrated that the Manufacturing 5 \\nvalidation Process delivers parts consistent  with the Design Intent (see \\nFAA Report number DOT/FAA/AR- 06/3).  Process validation \\nis understood in this AC to incl ude an inspection of the part for \\ngeometric anomalies (cracks, scratches, dents, scores, etc.) \\nafter manufacture.  Such an inspection may be visual, enhanced visual, or semi-automatic such as ECI.  In addition, an implicit \\nconsideration in assign ing credit to the vari ous processes is that \\nsecondary operations such as  chamfering, edge breaking and \\nfinishing are controlled and subj ect to process validation as \\ndescribed in FAA Report number DOT/FAA/AR-06/3. \\nSingle The removal in a finishing ope ration of a small depth of 5 \\nPoint material, at least 0.004\" deep, in the bore of the hole by use of \\nBoring a single point boring tool. This credit is allowed for titanium \\nalloys only. \\nHoning The removal of a small dept h of material, at least 0.002\", by a \\nself-centering grinding operation.  This credit is allowed for all \\nmaterials. 5 \\nCoolant A device which ensures that th ere is a continuous flow of 5 \\nMonitor coolant with periodic check s on the pressure and the \\nconcentration of the coolant s upplemented with the training of \\noperators to ensure the direction of the flow towards the cutting edge (see FAA Report number  DOT/FAA/AR-06/3).  This \\ncredit is allowed for all materials. \\nPower Monitor A device that continuously monitors the power consumed by the machine tool and which must be shown to be sensitive to conditions such as worn tools, lo ss of coolant, etc., which give \\nrise to anomalies (see FAA Report number DOT/FAA/AR\\xad06/3). This credit is allowed for all materials. For the use of either a power monitor or a feed force monitor, 20. For the use of Feed Force A device that continuously monitors the feed force used by the \\nMonitor machine tool and which must be shown to be sensitive to conditions such as worn tools, lo ss of coolant, etc., which give \\nrise to anomalies (see FAA Report number DOT/FAA/AR\\xad06/3).

Generally, this would be an etch inspection specifically targeted at the hole and which must be \\nshown to detect such anomalies.  This credit is allowed for all materials. 5 \\n2. \\tRules for Applying Credits. \\na. Process validation is assumed to be mandatory on machining processes on all future \\nproducts. \\nb. Use of manufacturing cred its including process validati on should be part of the \\ncertification data submittal. \\nc. Coolant monitoring, power monitoring, and feed force monitoring should be used in \\nboth roughing and finishing operations. \\nd. Credit for process monitoring (power or f eed force) cannot be claimed unless coolant \\nmonitoring is also in use. \\ne. Credit for either single point bore or honi ng can be claimed, as appropriate, but not for \\nboth together. 3. \\tCredit Application Process. \\na. Decide which controls are to be applied. \\nb. Total the credit factors for the combination of controls. \\nc. Calculate the probability of bur st for the hole feature in the disc. \\nd. Divide the probability of burst by the total of the credit factors. \\ne. This reduced probability of burst  should be compared to the DTR. \\n4. Credit Examples.

GUIDANCE  CHAPTER 2\\n Continued Rotation (14 CFR 33.74).  2.1\\n General.  2.1.1\\n14 CFR 33.74 imposes a design requirement that basic continued rotation failure \\nconditions or events do not develop into a hazardous event over a sustained continued \\nrotation period.  Continued rotation refers to a condition in which any main rotating \\nsystem in an engine continues to ro tate after the engine has been shut down. Continued \\nrotation can be caused by windmilling or mechanical effects, or a combination of both.  \\nWindmilling is the rotation of a non -operating engine due to the airflow -induced \\nforces on the blades caused by the f orward motion of the aircraft.  Mechanical effects \\ninclude, for example, drive shaft clutch drag in some multiengine  rotorcraft \\ninstallations, which may result in continued rotation of the engine after it has been shut \\ndown.  \\n14 CFR 33.74 applies  to turbine engines installed in airplane s and rotorcraft s. \\nCompliance to § 33.74 can be by test, analysis, or any method we determine to be \\nacceptable.  \\n Installation Assessment.  2.1.2\\nTest, analysis, or other data that you use to demonstrate compliance , should represent \\nall planned or intended aircraft engine installations. When you conduct tests or \\nanalyses , ensure that the baseline certification assumptions address all intended aircraft \\napplications.  \\nAdditional compliance data may be necessary if a future installation is m ore critical \\nthan those assumed in the original certification basis . For examples:  two, rather than \\nfour, engine installation differences  which may impact airflow -induced forces  due to \\ndifferent aircraft speed ; different mission profile ; and i mplementation  of extended \\noperations (ETOPS) . \\n Failure Conditions.  2.1.3\\n2.1.3.1  General . \\nYou should address  any failure condition that results  in continued rotation  \\nafter the engine is shutdown , and show that it will not result in a hazardous \\ncondition.  Refer to the following subpar agraphs (subparagraph 2.1.3.2  \\nthrough subparagraph  2.1.3.6 ). \\n2.1.3.2  Applicable Failure Conditions . \\nThe following conditions may result in continued rotation  after the engine is \\nshutdown  (other conditions may also apply):  loss of rotor centerline support \\n(for example, main bearing failure, bearing support failure, fusing of \\nfrangible main bearing designs, etc.) ; engine rotor airfoil loss and resulting \\nunbalance effects, including § 33.94 fan and turbine blade -out conditions ; \\ncomplete loss of engine oil supply , oil quantity , or oil pressure ; and any \\n06/23/2016  AC 33.74/92 -1B \\n2-2 basic nonhazardous , in-flight shutdown (IFSD) cause, such as fuel \\nstarvation.  \\n \\n2.1.3.3  Inherently Hazardous Basic Engine Failures . \\nSection  33.74 generally does not consider c ertain inherently hazardous basic \\nengine failures , such as main rotor structure failures (disks, spacers, seals, \\nand shafts . etc. ), unless those failures  are considered initially nonhazardous ; \\nor would likely result in sustained continued rotation of the engine.  \\nFailure of such components usually results  in a limited period of rotation \\nafter the initial event.  \\n2.1.3.4  Rotor Locking Device Failure . \\nSection  33.74 generally does not consider r otor locking device failure \\nscenarios , since t he rotor locking device is expected to perform its intended \\nfunction  per the requirements of §  33.92 . Refer to  paragraph  2.2 for \\nguidance.  \\n2.1.3.5  Failed Airframe Structure  or Airframe Foreign Object Source Ingestion . \\nSection  33.74 does not  consider  ingestion of failed airframe structures  (for \\nexample, slat/flap or radome parts ); or s ignificant airframe foreign object \\nsources  (for example, lavatory ice ), if beyond the scope of part 33 type \\ncertification . \\n2.1.3.6  Effect of Continued Rotation on Other  Aircraft Structures, Systems, or \\nFlight Crew . \\nSection  33.74 does not apply to the effects of engine continued rotation on  \\nother aircraft structures ; other aircraft systems ; and the f light crew.  \\n Operating C onditions.  2.1.4\\n2.1.4.1  General.  \\nYou should determine the flight conditions that could occur during \\ncontinued rotation operations. This determination should include, but is not \\nlimited to, the criteria described in the following subparagraphs  \\n(subparagraph 2.1.4.2  through subparagraph 2.1.4.5 ). \\n2.1.4.2  Maximum Exposure Time for Continued Rotation for Individual Event.  \\nDetermination of t he maximum exposure time for continued rotation must \\nconsider all exposure time scenarios regardless of expected probability , and \\ntherefore : must not be based on the probability of occurrence as a function \\nof flight phase ; should consider  special operations , such as ETOPS, and \\nmust cover the maximum diversion time of the airplane during such \\noperations ; must address the maximum diversion time approved for the \\nengine, i f the engine is approved for Early ETOPS eligibility in accordance \\n06/23/2016  AC 33.74/92 -1B \\n2-3 with § 33.201 ; and s hould assume a  minimum diversion time of one hour for \\nall non -ETOPS aircraft applications.  \\n2.1.4.3  Turbine Rotor(s) Rotational Speeds within One -Engine Inoperative Flight \\nEnvelope.  \\nDetermination of t urbine rotor(s) rotational speeds within the one -engine \\ninoperative flight envelope  should  take into account significant flight phases \\n(takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing ). It should also \\nconsider the effect of engine damage on continued rotation rotor speeds.  \\n2.1.4.4  Unbalance Levels . \\nDetermi nation of u nbalance  levels  must consider the initial event and \\nsubsequent damage, as they apply to the failure condition that you are \\nevaluating . \\n2.1.4.5  Engines Certificated for Use on Supersonic Aircraft.  \\nYou must show compliance for the expected duration at supersonic and \\nsupersonic -to-subsonic transition flight conditions . This is in addition to \\nduration of continued rotation for the remainder of flight at subsonic speeds.  \\n Pass/Fail Criteria.  2.1.5\\nSection 33.74 defines the pass/fail criteria. The compliance deter mination should \\nconsider both the initial event and the duration of the continued rotation.  \\n Compliance Considerations.  2.1.6\\n2.1.6.1  General.  \\nYou should take into consideration the criteria in the following \\nsubparagraphs (subparagraph 2.1.6.2  through subparagraph 2.1.6.7 ) when \\nyou develop your analysis technique . \\n2.1.6.2  Fire Hazard s. \\nProtection against fire is especially important during extended continued \\nrotation periods.  Continued rotation of the main rotors , coupled with high \\nunbalance levels , could  produce high stress levels in flammable -fluid -\\nconveying parts at sub -idle natural frequencies.  Failure of such parts could \\nresult in leakage of hazardous quantities of flammable fluids and increased \\nfire hazard. For example, in some engine designs, continued rotation will \\nresult in continued main engine oil flow (no shutoff means) with the \\npotentia l for leakage if  certain oil system parts fail.  Continued rotation  could \\nalso r esult in “rubbing” of titanium rotor and stator components with the \\npotential for a titanium fire and increased fire hazard.  \\nYou should assess the applicable continued rotation conditions against the \\nfire protection requirements of § 33.17 and § 33.75. The fire protection \\nassessment should consider both the initial event and the duration of the \\ncontinued rotation.  \\n06/23/2016  AC 33.74/92 -1B \\n2-4 2.1.6.3  Fatigue Assessment.  \\nYou should perform a fatigue assessment for an installed engine over the \\nassumed diversion profile. This assessment should account for  transient \\nexposure to peak vibrations, such as the initial event . This assessment  \\nshould also account for s ustained exposure  to vibration loads over the \\nmaximum continued rotation period. Average material properties may be \\nused. \\nFor each component you evaluate, you should show the accumulated fatigue \\ndamage to be less than or equal to the fatigue damage to failure of the \\ncomponent, so that the conditions of § 33.75(g)(2)(i) through (vi) do not \\noccur over the continued rotation period. The fatigue assessment should \\nconsider both the initial event and the duration of the continued rotation.  \\n2.1.6.4  Loads.  \\nYou should determine loads on the engine structure by test, validated \\nanalysis, or both. You should determine t he steady and vibratory loads for \\nthe significant operating con ditions noted in  paragraph  2.1.4  of this AC, and \\ntake into consider ation : the range of continued rotation frequencies for the \\nvarious failure events ; continued rota tion periods ; aircraft accelerations ; and \\nambient temperature variation.  \\nLoad determination should consider b oth the initial event and the duration of \\nthe continued rotation.  \\n2.1.6.5  Electrical Discharge.  \\nYou should consider the potential hazard of electrical discharge from \\nignition exciters that, by design, continue to build a charge during continued \\nrotation. The objective is  to prevent ignition sources within the engine \\nnacelle that may affect maintenance p ersonnel after flight completion.  \\n2.1.6.6  Analysis Methodologies.  \\nYour a nalysis techniques must be able to provide sufficient detail to \\ndetermine the continued rotation loads on the installed engine. You must \\nadequately validate t hese techniques by demonstrating the capability to \\npredict dynamic results for the identified continued rotation conditions.  \\nBefore  you use an analysis to produce new certification compliance data to \\nrepresent new design features or new operating environment s or operating \\ncharacteristics , it must be calibrated and validated using data from one of, or \\na combination of , the following:  prior certification test ; field data ; \\ncomponent tests ; and /or acceptable component test or laboratory test.  \\nYou must examine any component or laboratory test or tests used to produce \\nnew data for  quality , applicability to the new product being certified , and \\nadherence to your established engineering and testing standards , or to \\naccepted industry standards.  \\nYou may need to use conservative assumptions regarding installation to \\ncover multiple installations.  \\n06/23/2016  AC 33.74/92 -1B \\n2-5 2.1.6.7  Engine Modeling.  \\nAny models you use should  be validated ; contain sufficient detail to \\naccurately conduct transient and steady state analys es; include all major \\nengine static and rotating components ; and p rovide for representative \\nconnections at the engine -aircraft interfaces.  \\n Rotor Locking  Device  (14 CFR 33.92) . 2.2\\n General.  2.2.1\\nA rotor locking device is defined as any flight crew -actuated, engine type design \\ncomponent or system that prohibits engine rotor rotation after engine shutdown.  \\nActivation of the rotor locking device stops and prevents continued rotation of the \\nengine rotor(s) during flight, when the engine is not operating.  You may incorporate a \\nrotor locking devi ce into the engine type design, or as an aircraft installation \\nrequirement.   \\nIncorporation of a rotor locking device  complies with the safety objective of §  33.74  \\n(refer to paragraph  2.1). Incorporation of a rotor locking device m ust satisfy the \\noperational and endurance test requirements identified in §  33.92, when the engine is \\nsubjected to the environmental conditions that result in the maximum torque. The \\nassessm ent of the maximum torque should consider both damaged and undamaged \\nengine rotors.  \\n14 CFR 33.92  applies to turbine engines installed in airplanes and ro torcrafts that \\nincorporate a means to stop and lock the rotor(s) to prevent continued rotation.  \\nCompliance to § 33.92  must be demonstrated by test, the means to stop and lock the \\nrotor if continued rotation is prevented.  \\n Reliability.  2.2.2\\nBecause the rotor locking device is not expected to be used frequently , you should \\nshow that under normal engine oper ating conditions, the device will not deteriorate \\nbeyond serviceable limits  or fail to perform the intended function.  \\nOverall reliability, as related to continued rotation related failure modes, should be \\nconsistent with § 33.75(a)(3) requirements for prot ection against hazardous effects.  \\n Design Criteria.  2.2.3\\nYou should  ensure that t he rotor locking device is designed so that the flight crew may \\nlock (to stop rotation) and unlock (to initiate engine restart attempts) the device in \\nflight, as required.  You shoul d also e valuate the effect an uncommanded activation of \\nthe rotor locking device in flight can have on continued safe flight and landing of the \\naircraft. Significant effects should be explained in the Installation and Operating \\nInstructions required by § 33.5. Finally, you should e valuate the various environmental \\nthreat effects  (for example, rain, hail, icing, and bird ingestion ) on rotor locking device \\nperformance over the engine operating envelope. Significant effects should be \\nexplained in the Installat ion and Operating Instructions required by § 33.5.  \\n06/23/2016 AC 33.74/92- 1B \\n APPENDIX A \\nA-1 APPENDIX A.

WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE ADVISORY CIRCULAR ? This advisory circular \\n(AC) provid es guidance and describes acceptable methods, but not the only methods, for \\ndemonstrating compliance with the safety analysis requirements of § 33.75 of Title 14 of the Code \\nof Federal Regulations (14 CFR).  The information provided in this AC replaces the guidance in AC 33.75-1, issued on March 4, 2005. \\n2. WHO DOES THIS AC APPLY TO? a. The guidance provided in this document is directed to engine manufacturers, modifiers, \\nforeign regulatory authorities, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engine type \\ncertification engineers and their designees. \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation.  It describes acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations.  The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may elect to present.  Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used.  While these \\nguidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the relevant regulations.  On the other hand, if the FAA becomes aware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance.  \\nc. This material does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n      \\n      \\n    \\n      \\n     \\n      \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n \\n \\n 2/20/15 AC 33.75-1A, Chg 1 \\n3.

For the purposes of this AC, the following definitions apply: \\na. Analysis . A specific and detailed qualitative or quantitative evaluation of the engine \\nrelative to the requirements of § 33.75.  Examples include:  Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure \\nMode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) and Markov Analysis. \\n2\\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  AC 33.75-1A 9/26/07\\n \\nb. Assessment . A more general or broad evaluation of the engine that may include the \\nresults of the analysis completed, as well as any other information, to support compliance with § 33.75. \\nc. Check . An examination, inspection, or test to determine the physical integrity or the \\nfunctional capability of an item. \\nd. Error. An omission or incorrect action by a crew member or person in charge of the \\nmaintenance, or a mistake in requirements, design, or implementation.

An occurrence that originates apart from the engine or aircraft (for \\nexample, icing or bird strikes). \\nf. Failure Condition. A condition with a direct, consequential engine- level effect, caused or \\ncontributed to by one or more fa ilures.  Examples include limitation of thrust to idle or oil \\nexhaustion. \\ng.

Redundancy . Multiple independent methods incorporated to accomplish a given \\nfunction, each one of which is sufficient to accomplish the function. \\ni.  System . A combination of inter- related items arranged to perform a specific function(s ). \\nj.  Toxic Products . Products that act as or have the effect of a poison when humans are \\nexposed to them. \\n5. BACKGROUND.  \\na. The ultimate objective of a safety analysis is to ensure that the risk to the aircraft from \\nall engine failure conditions is acceptably low.  The basis of a safety analysis is the concept that \\nan acceptable total engine design risk is achievable by managing the individual engine risks to \\nacceptable levels.  This concept emphasizes reducing the likelihood or probability of an event proportionally with the severity of its effects.  The safety analysis should support the engine design goals so that major or hazardous engine effects resulting from engine failure modes do not exceed the required probability of occurrence. \\nb. Engine manufacturers and modifiers may show compliance with § 33.75 through a \\nsafety analysis substantiated, when necessary, by appropriate testing, comparable service experience, or both.  Depending on the circumstances of the application or modification, a safety \\nanalysis can be: \\n• a report describing details associated with a failure condition; \\n• an interpretation of test results; \\n3\\n \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n \\n 9/26/07 AC 33.75-1A\\n \\n• a comparison of two similar components or assemblies;\\n \\n• other qualitative information; or\\n \\n• a detailed, in -depth analysis. \\nc. The analysis should consider the range of expected operations.  There are failure \\nconditions that only exist in certain aspects of operation or in certain missions; an analysis of the probability of their occurrence must consider the probability of that aspect or mission, combined with the subsequent probability of failure. \\nd. The depth and scope of an acceptable safety analysis also depends on the following: \\n(1)  The complexity and criticality of the functions performed by the system(s), \\ncomponents, or assemblies under consideration; \\n(2)  The severity of related failure conditions; \\n(3)  The uniqueness of the design and extent of relevant service experience; \\n(4)  The number and complexity of the identified failures; and \\n(5)  The detectability o f contributing failures. \\n6. SECTION 33.75 - GENERAL .  \\na.  Section 33.75 defines the engine- level effects and presumed severity levels.  The severity \\nclassifications of aircraft -level failure effects do not apply directly to engine safety assessments \\nbecause the aircraft may have features that could reduce or increase the consequences of an \\nengine failure condition.  Additionally, the same type- certificated engine may be used in a variety \\nof installations, each with its own aircraft- level severity classification of the same failure effect. \\nb.  Aircraft -level requirements for individual failure conditions may be more severe than the \\nengine- level requirements.  Therefore, the engine manufacturer and the aircraft manufacturer \\nshould coordinate with each other, as well as with the relevant FAA certification offices, to \\nensure that the engine may be installed in the aircraft.  Applicants should be aware of the possibility of more restrictive regulations in the installed condition. \\n7. SECTION 33.75(a)(1). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(a)(1) reads as follows:  “The applicant must analyze the \\nengine, including the control system, to assess the likely consequences of all failures that can \\nreasonably be expected to occur.  This analysis will take into account, if applicable: \\n(i)  Aircraft -level devices and procedures assumed to be associated with a typical \\ninstallation.  Such assumptions must be stated in the analysis. \\n4\\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33.75-1A 9/26/07\\n \\n(ii)  Consequential secondary failures and latent failures. \\n(iii)  Multiple failures referred to in paragraph (d) of this section or that result in the \\nhazardous engine effects defined in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.” \\nb. Guidance . \\n(1)  The reference to a typical installation in § 33.75(a)(1)(i) does not imply that the \\naircraft -level effects are known.  Instead, “typical installation” means that any aircraft devices \\nand procedures, such as fire-extinguishing equipment, annunciation devices, etc., that the safety analysis assumes to be present should be clearly stated in the analy sis.  The applicant should also \\ninclude such assumptions in the installation instructions under § 33.5(c).  Regulations that cover the certification of aircraft (14 CFR parts 23, 25, 27, and 29) contain aircraft- level device \\nrequirements.  These regulation s include xx.1305, Powerplant instruments. \\n(2)  A component level safety analysis may be an auditable part of the design process or \\nmay be conducted specifically for demonstration of compliance with this rule. \\n(3)  The applicant should include possible latency period of failures in the assessment of \\nfailure probabilities. \\n(4)  ‘Multiple failures’ are several components failing or malfunctioning independently \\nor in a cascading fashion. \\n8. SECTIONS 33.75(a)(2) and 33.75(a)(3). \\na. Rule Text .  Secti on 33.75(a)(2) reads as follows:  “The applicant must summarize those \\nfailures that could result in major engine effects or hazardous engine effects, as defined in \\nparagraph (g) of this section, and estimate the probability of occurrence of those effects. Any \\nengine part the failure of which could reasonably result in a hazardous engine effect must be clearly identified in this s ummary ” \\nb. Rule Text . Section 33.75(a)(3) reads as follows:  “The applicant must show that \\nhazardous engine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as extremely remote (probability range of 10\\n-7 to 10-9 per engine flight hour).  Since the estimated probability \\nfor individual failures may be insufficiently precise to enable the applicant to assess th e total rate \\nfor hazardous engine effects, compliance may be shown by demonstrating that the probability of a hazardous engine effect arising from an individual failure can be predicted to be not greater than 10\\n-8 per engine flight hour.  In dealing with probabilities of this low order of magnitude, \\nabsolute proof is not possible, and compliance may be shown by reliance on engineering judgment and previous experience combined with sound design and test philosophies.” \\n5\\n \\n      \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n 9/26/07\\t AC 33.75-1A\\n \\nc. Guidance . \\n(1) The occurrence rate for hazardous engine effects applies to each individual effect. \\nThe probability target of 10-7 or less per engine flight hour for each hazardous engine effect \\napplies to the summation of the probabilities of that effect arising from individual failure modes or combinations of failure modes other than the failure of critical components (that is, disks, hubs, spacers).  For example, the total rate of occurrence of uncontrolled fires, obtained by adding up the individual failure modes and combination of failure modes leading to an uncontrolled fire, should not exceed 10\\n-7 per engine flight hour.  If each individual failure is less \\nthan 10-8 per engine flight hour, summation is not required.  That is, compliance may be shown \\nby demonstrating that either:  \\n1.\\t each individual way of causing the particular hazardous engine effect is less \\nthan 10-8 per engine flight hour, or \\n2.\\t all ways combined of causing the particular hazardous engine effect sum to less than 10\\n-7 per engine flight hour.  \\n(2) There is inherent difficulty in demonstrating very low failure probabilities for the \\nprimary failure of single components or parts—for example, the primary structural failure of a disk.  This failure condition, which likely results directly in a hazardous engine effect, should be extremely remote.  However, the specific numerical probability cannot be reasonably estimated or demonstrated.  If the primary failure of critical single components or parts (disks, hubs, impellers, large rotating seals, and other similar large rotating components) is likely to result in hazardous engine effects, the applicant should rely on meeting the prescribed integrity requirements, such as those in §§ 33.15, 33.27, and 33.70. These requirements support a design goal, among others, that primar y low -cycles fatigue (LCF) failure of the component should be \\nextremely remote throughout its operational life . \\n(3) The primary failure of critical components such as disks, hubs, impellers, large \\nrotating seals, and other similar large rotating compon ents need not be included in the summation \\nrequired for each hazardous engine effect. \\n9. SECTION 33.75(a)(4). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(a)(4) reads as follows: “The applicant must show that major \\nengine effects are predicted to occur at a rate not in excess of that defined as remote (probability \\nrange of 10\\n-5 to 10-7 per engine flight hour).” \\nb. Guidance . Applicants may show compliance with (a)(4) by demonstrating that the \\nindividual failures or combinations of failures resulting in major engine effects have probabilities \\nnot greater than 10-5 per engine flight hour.  No summation of the individual failure modes or \\ncombinations of failure modes is necessary for the major engine effects. \\n6\\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n AC 33.75-1A 9/26/07\\n \\n10. SECTION 33.75(b). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(b) reads as follows:  “T he FAA may require that any \\nassumption as to the effects of failures and likely combination of failures be verified by test.” \\nb. Guidance . Prediction of the likely progression of some engine failures may rely \\nextensively upon engineering judgment and is not susceptible to absolute proof.  If the validity of such engineering judgment is in question to the extent that the conclusions of the analysis could be invalid, additional substantiation may be required.  Additional substantiation may consist of reference to previous relevant service experience, engineering analysis, material, component, rig or engine test or a combination of these.  If doubt of the validity of the substantiation exists, additional testing or other validation may be required.  \\n11. SECTION 33.75(c). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(c) reads as follows:  “The primary failure of certain single \\nelements cannot be sensibly estimated in numerical terms.  If the failure of such elements is \\nlikely to result in hazardous engine effects, then compliance may be shown by reliance on the prescribed integrity requirements of §§ 33.15, 33.27, and 33.70 as applicable.  These instances must be stated in the safety analysis.” \\nb. Guidance . The intent of this section is to take account of the inherent difficulty of \\ndemonstrating very low failure probabilities for the primary failure of single components or parts – for example, the primary structural failure of a disk.  The expectation is that this failure condition, which likely results directly in the hazardous engine effect of non-containment of high-energy debris, should be extremely remote, but the specific numerical probability cannot be \\nestimated or demonstrated. \\n12. SECTION 33.75(d). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(d) reads as follows:  “If reliance is placed on a safety system \\nto prevent a failure from progressing to hazardous engine effects, the possibility of a safety \\nsystem failure in combination with a basic engine failure must be included in the analysis.  Such a safety system may include safety devices, instrumentation, early warning devices, maintenance checks, and other similar equipment or procedures.  If items of a safety system are outside the control of the engine manufacturer, the assumptions of the safety analysis with respect to the \\nreliability of these parts must be clearly stated in the analysis and identified in the installation instructions under § 33.5 of this part.” \\nb. Guidance .   The safety system failure may be present as a latent failure or may occur \\nsimultaneously with, or subsequent to, the basic engine failure. \\n7\\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n      \\n 9/26/07 AC 33.75-1A\\n \\n13. SECTIONS 33.75(e) and (e)(1). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(e) reads as follows:  “If the safety analysis depends on one or \\nmore of the following items, those items must be identified in the analysis and appropriately \\nsubstantiated.” \\nb. Rule Text . Section 33.75(e)(1) reads as follows:  “Maintenance actions being carried \\nout at stated intervals.  This includes the verification of the serviceability of items that could fail in a latent manner.  When necessary to prevent hazardous engine effects, these maintenance \\nactions and intervals must be published in the instructions for continued airworthiness required under § 33.4 of this part.  Additionally, if errors in maintenance of the engine, including the control system, could lead to hazardous engine effects, the appropriate procedures must be included in the relevant engine manuals.” \\nc. Guidance . \\n(1) The analysis summary should include general statements that refer to regular \\nmainten ance in a shop as well as on the line.  The analysis should also note any specific failure \\nrates that rely on special or unique maintenance checks. \\n(2) The engine maintenance manual, overhaul manual, or other relevant manuals may \\nserve as substantiation for § 33.75(e)(1).  A listing of all possible incorrect maintenance actions \\nis not required. \\nd. Maintenance error lessons learned . Maintenance errors have contributed to serious \\nevents at the aircraft level.  Many of these events have arisen from similar maintenance being \\nperformed on multiple engines during the same maintenance availability by one maintenance crew and are therefore primarily an aircraft -level concern.  If appropriate, the applicant should \\nconsider communicating strategies against perfo rming maintenance on multiple engines installed \\non the same aircraft as part of the same maintenance action (see, for example, SAIB NE -00-12 on \\n“Multiple -engine Maintenance” or various requirements for Extended Operations (ETOPS) with \\nMulti-Engine Airplanes. The applicant should also consider mitigating the effects of maintenance errors in the design phase.  Components undergoing frequent maintenance should be designed to facilitate the maintenance and correct re-assembly of the component.  However, completely eliminating sources of maintenance error during design is not possible. \\n(1) The following multiple engine maintenance errors have repeatedly occurred in \\nservice and have caused one or more serious events: \\n(a) Failure to restore oil system or b orescope access integrity after routine \\nmaintenance (oil chip detector or filter check).  Similar consideration should be given to other systems. \\n(b) Misinstallation of O -rings. \\n8\\n \\n    \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n    AC 33.75-1A 9/26/07\\n \\n(c) Servicing with incorrect fluids. \\n(2) Improper maintenance on parts such as disks, hubs, and spacers has led to failures \\nresulting in hazardous engine effects.  Examples of this type of improper maintenance that have occurred in service are overlooking existing cracks or damage during inspection and failure to apply or incorrect application of protective coatings (for example, anti- gallant or anti- corrosive). \\n14. SECTION 33.75(e)(2). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(e)(2) reads as follows:  “Verification of the satisfactory \\nfunctioning of safety or other devices at pre-flight or other stated periods.  The details of this satisfactory functioning must be published in the appropriate manual.” \\nb. Guidance .  If the safety analysis relies on special or unique maintenance checks for \\nprotective devices, these assumptions should be identified in the analysis and appropriately substantiated by reference to the appropriate manuals. \\n15. SECTION 33.75(e)(3). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(e)(3) reads as follows:  “The provisions of specific \\ninstrumentation not otherwise required.” \\nb. Guidance . If the assumptions or provisions of the safety analysis rely on specific \\ninstrumentation not required elsewhere, the analysis should state that information. 16. SECTION 33.75(e)(4). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(e)(4) reads as follows; “Flig ht crew actions to be specified in \\nthe operating instructions established under § 33.5.” \\nb. Guidance. If the safety analysis relies on special actions by the flight crew, these actions \\nmust be specified in the operating instructions established under § 33.5. 17. SECTION 33.75(f). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(f) reads as follows:  “If applicable, the safety analysis must \\nalso include, but not be limited to, investigation of the following: \\n(1)  Indicating equipment; \\n(2)  Manual and automatic cont rols; \\n(3)  Compressor bleed systems; \\n(4)  Refrigerant injection systems; \\n9\\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n 9/26/07 AC 33.75-1A\\n \\n(5)  Gas temperature control systems; \\n(6)  Engine speed, power, or thrust governors and fuel control systems; \\n(7)  Engine overspeed, overtemperature, or topping limiter s; \\n(8)  Propeller control systems; and \\n(9)  Engine or propeller thrust reversal systems.” \\nb. Guidance .  The safety analysis is not limited to the items listed in § 33.75(f). \\n18. SECTIONS 33.75(g) and (g)(1). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g) reads as follows:  “Unless otherwise approved by the FAA \\nand stated in the safety analysis, for compliance with part 33, the following failure definitions apply to the engine:” \\nb. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(1) reads as follows:  “An engine failure in which the only \\nconsequence is partial or complete loss of thrust or power (and associated engine services) from the engine will be regarded as a minor engine effect.” \\nc. Guidance . \\n(1) Engine failures involving complete loss of thrust or power from the af fected engine \\ncan be expected to occur in service.  For the purposes of the engine safety analysis, the aircraft is assumed to be capable of controlled flight following such an event.  Therefore, for the purpose of the engine safety analysis and engine cer tification, engine failure with no effect other than loss of \\nthrust and services may be regarded as a comparatively safe failure with a minor engine effect. This assumption may be revisited during aircraft certification, when installation effects such as engine redundancy may be fully taken into consideration.  This reexamination applies only to aircraft certification and is not intended to affect engine certification. \\n(2) The safety analysis should cover the failure to achieve any given power or thrust \\nrating for which the engine is certificated.  Failur e to achieve power or rating is regarded as a \\nminor engine effect.  This assumption may be revisited during aircraft certification, particularly multi- engine rotorcraft certification.  This reexaminati on applies only to aircraft certification and \\nis not intended to affect engine certification.  \\n19. SECTION 33.75(g)(2). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2) reads as follows:  “The following effects will be \\nregarded as hazardous engine effects:” \\n10\\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n AC 33.75-1A 9/26/07\\n \\nb. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2)(i) reads as follows:  “Non-containment of high- energy \\ndebris;” \\nc. Guidance . \\n(1)  Uncontained debris covers a large spectrum of energy levels due to the various sizes \\nand velocities of parts released by the engine.  The engine has a containment structure that is designed to contain the release of a single blade and its consequences; it is also often adequate to contain additional released blades and static parts.  The engine containment structure is not expected to contain major rotating parts if they fracture.  Disks, hubs, impellers, large rotating \\nseals, and other similar large rotating components therefore always represent potential high -\\nenergy debris (and, thus, a hazardous engine effect).        \\n(2)  Uncontained blades from a multiple blade release are typically considered low -\\nenergy fragments because their energy has been significantly reduced in defeating the containment structure.  These events may typically be considered major engine effects. However, the release of significant numbers of blades (for example, corn-cobbed rotors) will likely include fragments exiting with high energy, and would therefore result in a hazardous engine effect. \\n(3)  Fan blades may have significant residual energy after defeatin g the containment \\nstructure, depending on the specifics of engine size, bypass ratio, and other design elements.  The applicant should carefully consider the inclusion of fan blade uncontainment under high energy debris (and thus, hazardous engine effects) or low energy debris (major engine effects). \\n(4)  The engine casings generally serve as the engine containment structure, as well as \\npressure vessels.  Thus, the rupture of an engine casing due to pressure loads is inherently not contained.  Service experience has shown that the rupture of the highest- pressure casings \\n(compressor delivery pressure) can generate high -energy debris; it should therefore be treated as \\na hazardous engine effect. \\nd. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2)(ii) reads as follows:  “Concentration of toxic products in \\nthe engine bleed air intended for the cabin sufficient to incapacitate crew or passengers;” \\ne. Guidance . \\n(1)  The generation and delivery of toxic products is considered a hazardous engine \\neffect if the toxic concen tration level results from abnormal engine operation and is sufficient to \\nincapacitate the crew or passengers during the subject flight . To be a hazardous engine effect: \\n(a)  The flow of toxic products would be so quick- acting as to be impossible to s top \\nbefore incapacitation occurred; or \\n(b)  There would be no effective means to stop the flow of incapacitating toxic \\nproducts to the crew compartment or passenger cabin; or \\n11\\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n    \\n  \\n 9/26/07 AC 33.75-1A\\n \\n(c)  The toxic products would be undetectable before incapacitation.  \\nToxic products could result from the degradation of abradable materials in the compressor when rubbed by rotating blades or from the degradation of oil that could leak into the compressor air flow.  \\n(2)  Applicants should not make assumptions about cabi n air dilution or mixing in this \\nengine-level analysis.  Those assumptions can only be properly evaluated during aircraft certification.  Applicants may show compliance with § 33.75(g)(2)(ii) through analyzing the relative concentration of toxic products in engine bleed air.  \\n(3)  Since these concentrations are of interest to the installer, the applicant should \\nprovide information on delivery rates and concentrations of toxic products in the engine bleed air for the cabin to the installer as part of the installation instructions. \\nf. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2)(iii) reads as follows:  “Significant thrust in the opposite \\ndirection to that commanded by the pilot;” \\ng. Guidance .  Engine failures resulting in significant thrust in the opposite directio n to that \\ncommanded by the pilot can, depending on the flight phase, result in a hazardous condition relating to aircraft controllability.  Those failures, if applicable to part 33 certification, that could be classified as hazardous engine events include: \\n(1)  Uncommanded thrust reverser deployment; \\n(2)  The unintended movement of the propeller blades below the established minimum \\nin-flight low -pitch position; and \\n(3)  High forward thrust when reverse thrust is commanded. \\nh. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2)(iv) reads as follows:  “Uncontrolled fire;” \\ni. Guidance . An uncontrolled fire is an extensive or persistent fire that is not effectively \\nconfined to a designated fire zone or that cannot be extinguished by using the aircraft means identified by the assumptions of the safety analysis.  Provision for flammable fluid drainage, fire \\ncontainment, fire detection, and fire extinguishing, may be considered when assessing the severity of the effects of a fire. \\nj. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2)(v) reads as follows:  “Failure of the engine mount \\nsystem leading to inadvertent engine separation;” \\nk. Guidance . Failure of the engine mount system leading to engine separation is \\nconsidered a hazardous engine effect since the separated engine may impact the aircraft and destroy critical systems or structures in flight.  Service experience has shown that this level of \\n12\\n \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n       \\n  \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n AC 33.75-1A 9/26/07\\n \\ndamage may occur during separations at high engine thrust levels.  Causes of engine mount system failure may include not only the high loads associated with severe engine damage, but \\nalso fatigue originating from handling damage, or from corrosion or inadequate strength associated with manufacturing or maintenance error. \\nl. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2)(vi) reads as follows: “Release of the propeller by the \\nengine, if applicable; and ” \\nm. Guidance . If the engine is designed for use with a propeller, release of the propeller \\ndue to engine failure modes is considered a hazardous engine effect. \\nn. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(2)(vii) r eads as follows:  “Complete inability to shut the \\nengine down.” \\no. Guidance . \\n(1) Complete inability to shut down the engine is considered a hazardous engine effect \\nbecause some circumstances of continued engine operation, even at low thrust or power, could represent a hazard.  These circumstances include the inhibition of the safe evacuation of passengers and crew, directional control problems during landing due to the inability to eliminate thrust or power, and the inability to ensure safe shut down when required following a failure. \\n(2) Allowing for aircraft -supplied equipment (fuel cutoff means, etc.) to protect against \\nthe “complete inability” to shut down the engine is acceptable.  A time delay of several minutes, but normally not more than 5 minutes, is acceptable between initiation of the shutdown and termination of the combustion cycle.  \\n(3) The inclusion of “complete inability to shut the engine down” as a hazardous \\nengine effect does not preclude hardware or software intended to protec t against inadvertent \\nengine shutdown, including aircraft logic to mitigate against the inadvertent shutdown of all engines. \\n20. SECTION 33.75(g)(3). \\na. Rule Text . Section 33.75(g)(3) reads as follows:  “An effect whose severity falls \\nbetween those effects covered in paragraphs (g)(1) and (g)(2) of this section will be regarded as a \\nmajor engine effect.” \\nb. Guidance .  Major engine effects are those effects likely to significantly increase crew \\nworkload or reduce the safety margins between the engin e operating condition and a hazardous \\nengine failure.  The items listed below represent a guide to the scope of major engine effects. Not all of these items apply to all engines due to differing engine design features, and the list does not include all possible effects. \\n13\\n \\n      \\n     \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n     \\n      \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n 9/26/07 AC 33.75-1A\\n \\n(1) Controlled fires (that is, those fires brought under control by shutting down the \\nengine or by on-board extinguishing systems). \\n(2) Case burnthrough when it can be shown that there is no propagation to hazardous \\nengine effects. \\n(3) Release of low -energy debris when applicants can show that the release does not \\nprogress to a hazardous engine effect. \\n(4) Vibration levels that result in crew discomfort. \\n(5) Concentration of toxic products in the engine bleed air for the cabin sufficient to \\ndegrade crew performance.  Note:  This is the same consideration as for a hazardous engine effect, but the toxic products are slow- enough acting or are readily detectable so that crew action \\nis able to stop the toxic product generation or delivery prior to incapacitation.  If appropriate, applicants should also consider the possible reduction in crew capabilities due to exposure while the crew is identifying and stopping the toxic products.  Because these concentrations are of interest to th e installer, the applicant should provide information on delivery rates and \\nconcentrations of toxic products in the engine bleed air for the cabin to the installer as part of the installation instructions. \\n(6) Thrust in the opposite direction to that commanded by the pilot, below the level \\ndefined as a hazardous engine effect. \\n(7) Generation of thrust greater than maximum rated thrust. \\n(8) Loss of engine support loadpath integrity without actual engine separation. \\n(9) Significant uncontrollable thrust oscillation. \\n21. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. \\na. Improper operation. Errors in engine operation have contributed to serious events at the \\naircraft level.  The applicant should consider mitigating the effects of improper engine operation \\nor providing operating instructions that reduce the likelihood of improper operation.  In particular, abnormal engine symptoms and the desired response or appropriate procedures for trouble-shooting these symptoms should be communicated to the installer (reference § 33.5). \\nb. Assembly . If the incorrect assembly of parts could result in hazardous engine effects, \\nthose parts should be designed to minimize the risk of incorrect assembly, or, if this is not practical, be permanently marked to indicate their correct posit ion when assembled.  \\n14\\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n AC 33.75-1A 9/26/07\\n \\n22. ANALYTICAL TECHNIQUES. \\na. The depth and scope of an acceptable safety assessment depends on the complexity and \\ncriticality of the functions performed by the system(s), components, or assemblies under \\nconsideration, the severity of related failure conditions, the uniqueness of the design and extent of relevant service experience, the number and complexity of the identified causal failure scenarios, and the detectability of contributing failures. \\nb. There are various techniques for performing a safety analysis; the ones listed below \\nrepresent two of the most commonly used methods.  An applicant may propose other comparable techniques, and variations or combinations of these techniques are also acceptable.  For derivative engines , limiting the scope of the analysis to modified components or operating \\nconditions and their effects on the rest of the engine is acceptable.  The applicant and the engine certification office should agree early in the certification program on the scope and methods of assessment to be used.  \\nc. Various methods for assessing the causes, severity levels, and likelihood of potential \\nfailure conditions are available to support experienced engineering judgment.  The various types of analyses are based on eit her inductive or deductive approaches.  Brief descriptions of typical \\nmethods are provided below; more detailed descriptions of analytical techniques may be found in the documents referenced in paragraph 3 of this AC. \\n(1) Failure Modes and Effects Anal ysis. An FMEA is a structured, inductive, bottom-\\nup analysis that is used to evaluate the effects on the engine system of each possible element or component failure.  When properly formatted, it will aid in identifying latent failures and the possible causes of each failure mode. \\n(2) Fault Tree or Dependence Diagram (Reliability Block Diagram) Analyses .  These \\nanalyses are structured, deductive, top-down analyses that are used to identify the conditions, failures, and events that would cause each define d failure condition.  These analyses are \\ngraphical methods of identifying the logical relationship between each particular failure condition and the primary element or component failures, other events, or their combinations that can cause the failure condi tion.  A Fault Tree Analysis is failure -oriented and is conducted from \\nthe perspective of which failures must occur to cause a defined failure condition.  A Dependence Diagram Analysis is success -oriented and is conducted from the perspective of which fail ures \\nmust not occur to preclude a defined failure condition. \\n//signed by Thomas A.

APPLICABILITY . This AC applies to electrical and electronic engine control (EEC) \\nsystems used on aircraft engines certificated under 14 CFR part 33 and intended for use in \\naircraft certificated under parts 23, 25, 27, and 29.  This document also applies to any electrical or electronic systems that control an engine function, for example overspeed or temperature limiting systems.  In some cases, controls for functions not normally covered under part 33 or required for engine control are integrated into the EEC (for example, propeller controls regulated under part 35).  In these cases, this document also applies to those functions integrated into the EEC system, but only to the extent that those functions affect part 33 requirements.

(2 pages) \\nPage vii (and viii) \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 1.  GENERAL \\n1-1. Background.\\n a. Section 33.28 was added to part 33, Airworthiness Standards for Aircraft Engines, as \\nAmendment 15 (58 FR 29095, 5/18/93) and became effective on August 16, 1993.  An \\naccompanying advisory circular (AC) was not issued at the time.\\n b. Initially, EEC technology was primarily applied to engines designed for large transport \\naircraft applications.  The certification practice and implementation of §33.28 was oriented toward these applications.  When the use of EEC technology was limited to a small group of manufacturers, the information and guidance provided in the rule itself was adequate.  Since the use of EEC controls has spread, a need for an AC has become evident in several recent engine certification programs.\\n c. In addition, industry representatives from the engine community that design engines for \\napplications other than large transport aircraft certificated under part 25 have questioned the criteria used to determine equivalence to the typical hydromechanical system.  A basic criteria for FAA acceptance of the replacement of hydromechanical technology with electronic technology for engine controls is that the new technology must have an equivalent level of integrity and reliability as the technology being replaced.  Because the data used to establish the criteria for equivalent reliability of a typical hydromechanical system was based on part 25 certification experience, other industry representatives have presented a valid argument that the equivalence criteria to a hydromechanical system should be based on data for hydromechanical control systems used in their respective part 23, 27, and 29 certifications. \\n1-2. Introduction. One of the objectives for the engine manufacturer in an engine certification \\nprogram is to show that the certificated engine will be “installable” in a particular aircraft or \\naircraft type.  If the aircraft application is unknown at the time of engine certification, the engine manufacturer should make reasonable installation and operational assumptions for the anticipated aircraft application.\\n a. To facilitate achieving this objective, the engine manufacturer should provide a document \\nthat describes the EEC system and its operation to both the engine certification office (ECO) and the aircraft certification office (ACO).  Using this document, along with other documentation and test results, the ACO will determine if the EEC system has reasonable assurance of being in compliance with the applicable aircraft certification regulations (§§ 901, 903, and 1309 of parts 23, 25, 27, 29).\\n b. Providing the EEC documentation to the ACO is particularly important when the system is \\nnovel or unique and differs from previously certificated systems.  The ECO will also coordinate with the appropriate FAA engine controls specialist(s) in this regard.  If these reviews indicate that the engine may not be installable in the intended aircraft type, the ECO will inform the applicant and the appropriate ACO of any potential certification issues.  The final determination for compliance with these aircraft regulations will be determined by the appropriate ACO at \\nPar 1-1 Page 1-1 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01\\n \\naircraft certification, when more complete test and analysis data is available.  This coordination \\nwith the ACO is only necessary for the initial aircraft application of the engine.  If an aircraft is not identified as the anticipated installation for the engine, a review may be conducted with the applicable Standards Staff.  Any installation limitations or operational issues will be noted in the engine Installation or Operational Manuals and the engine Type Certification Data Sheet (TCDS). Applicants should also be aware that the ACO may require flight testing to fully evaluate engine performance and operability characteristics for all operating modes. \\n1-3. Definitions.\\n a. Aircraft-Supplied Data . Aircraft-supplied data is information that is generated in the \\naircraft systems and used by the engine control system, but whose source is not controlled under \\nthe design authority of the engine certification applicant.  This does not include input from those sensors that are used by, and normally dedicated to, the engine control system but may be mounted in the airframe.\\n b. Aircraft-Supplied Power. Aircraft-supplied power is any electrical power source that is an \\nintegral part of the aircraft electrical system and whose primary function is to power aircraft systems (for example, an electrical bus).\\n c. Alternate Control Mode(s). For the purposes of this AC, an alternate control mode is one \\nin which the operating characteristics or capabilities of the engine control are sufficiently different from the “normal mode” that they may significantly impact or change the operating characteristics or capabilities of the aircraft, crew workload, or what constitutes appropriate crew procedures.\\n d. Commercial and Industrial Grade Electronic Parts. Commercial (consumer quality parts) \\nand industrial grade electronic parts have typical operating ranges of 0 degrees to \\n+70 degrees \\nCelsius and -40 degrees to +85 degrees Celsius, respectively.  Vendor parts catalogs typically \\ndefine commercial and industrial grade electronic parts in these temperature ranges.\\n e. Electronic Engine Control (EEC) System. The EEC system is the generic family of \\nelectrical/electronic engine control systems, including full authority digital engine controls, supervisory controls, and derivatives of these.\\n f. Fault or Failure. This is an occurrence that affects the operation of a component, part, or \\nelement such that it can no longer function as intended, and includes both loss of function as well as a malfunction. Errors that may cause failures are not considered as failures.\\n     g. Fault or Failure Accommodation. This term refers to the capability of the control system \\nor crew to mitigate, either wholly or in part, the failure condition. \\nPage 1-2 Par 1-2 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nh. Fault or Failure Condition. This is a condition having an effect on the airplane or its \\noccupants, either direct or consequential, that is caused or contributed to by one or more failures \\nor errors, considering flight phase and relevant adverse operational or environmental conditions, or external events.\\n i. Fault or Failure Detection. This term refers to the discovery of a fault or failure condition \\nand either announcement of that condition to the flight crew by instrumentation or storage of the detection of that condition, or its results, in a fault memory for later retrieval through a built-in test capability of that control.\\n j. Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC). FADEC is a control system in which the \\nprimary functions are provided electronically and the electronic unit has full-range authority over the engine power or thrust.  FADEC systems have been certificated that employ either two identical channels to provide full-operational capability after failure of one channel or a single channel with a simplified electronic or hydromechanical back-up to provide an alternate operating mode.  The “FADEC system” includes all the control elements identified in the instruction manual, including: sensors, wiring, mechanical, pneumatic, or hydromechanical components and other limiter or protection devices.  If the control requires data from aircraft computers to operate, this data is considered part of the EEC or FADEC system, and the interface requirements for this data should be specified in the engine instruction manual. Mechanical components, such as the fuel pump, that do not interface with the EEC system are generally not included in the definition of FADEC system components.\\n k. Full-up System or Configuration. For the purposes of the system safety assessment (SSA) \\nanalyses described in this AC, the “full-up system” is one that does not have any faults or failures present, detected or undetected, that affect the control of engine power or thrust, engine protection systems, indication of critical engine operating parameters or other safety features of the control. In a “full-up system,” everything is operative.\\n l. Loss of Thrust Control (LOTC). For engines intended for use in airplanes certified under \\npart 23 Commuter Category standards, or part 25 standards (Transport Category), and in rotorcraft certified under part 27 or part 29 standards, this term refers to the loss of capability to modulate and maintain thrust or power between flight idle and 90 percent of maximum rated power or thrust at all operating conditions.  For engines intended for use in airplanes certified under part 23 Normal, Utility, or Acrobatic standards, this term refers to the loss of capability to modulate and maintain thrust or power between flight idle and 85 percent of maximum rated power or thrust, at all operating conditions.  One engine inoperative (OEI) or automatic take-off thrust control system (ATTCS) ratings and implementations are exempted from an LOTC analysis, because the portion of time spent at these ratings is relatively small, and they are covered by aircraft level analyses.\\n m. Per Hour. When the term “per hour” or “per flight hour” is used in this AC, the definition \\nis “per engine flight hour.” \\nPar 1-3 Page 1-3 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nn. Range of Control. This term refers to modulation of the engine from idle to 100 percent \\nmaximum rated thrust or power and includes any red line or higher rotor speed protection \\ncontrols and any engine temperature, torque, and pressure limits set and implemented by the control.\\n o. Take-off Envelope. This term refers to the operation of the aircraft at or below 1500 feet \\nabove ground level (AGL) during take-off or landing approach.  When distant obstacle clearance is involved, the take-off envelope may be increased to a higher altitude than 1500 feet AGL.  For rotorcraft, the take-off envelope is 1000 feet AGL for Category A rotorcraft, and within the height-velocity envelope for all others.\\n p. Uncovered Fault. An uncovered fault is a fault or failure for which either a detection \\nmechanism does not exist or, if there is a detection mechanism, an accommodation does not exist.\\n q. Unsafe Condition. For purposes of this AC only, an unsafe condition is a condition that, if \\nnot corrected, is reasonably expected to result in one or more serious injuries.  In this definition, “reasonably expected” means a probability of occurrence unacceptable to both the long-term risk and the intent of the applicable Type Design Standards. \\nPage 1-4 Par 1-3 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 2.  SECTION 33.28(a) \\n2-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(a) provides that each EEC must: “Have the control system \\ndescription, the percent of available power or thrust controlled in both normal operation and \\nfailure conditions, and the range of control of other controlled functions, specified in the instruction manual required by §33.5 for the engine.” \\n2-2. Intent of Rule. Section 33.28(a) requires the applicant to provide the necessary information \\nin the form of manuals to ensure safe engine installation and safe engine operation.  The data \\nunderlying the information provided in the manuals should be created as part of the engine certification program.  The manuals should include the following:\\n a. EEC system information that provides a clear understanding of the control system in the \\nnormal and any alternate control or operating modes;\\n b. Any differences in operation in other than the normal mode;\\n c. Any subtle interface requirements, such as power interrupt tolerance of the EEC;\\n d. Percent of available power or thrust in both normal operation and any alternate modes;\\n e. Range of control of other controlled functions; and\\n     f.  The environmental limitations of the engine installation. \\n2-3. Compliance with §33.28(a). The following is a method, but not the only method, of \\ncompliance with §33.28(a):\\n a. Control System Description. The applicant should include a brief control system \\ndescription in the instruction manual and may incorporate a more detailed system description document by reference.  The applicant should also consider other functions integrated into the EEC system.  If functions other than those directly associated with the control of the engine are integrated into the EEC system, (such as thrust reverser control, propeller control, or automatic starting) the applicant should include descriptions of these functions in the instruction manual. Even if the FADEC control is integrated wholly or in part within an aircraft avionics system, the engine manufacturer should provide an engine control system description that meets part 33 engine certification requirements and should include the relationship of the engine control system and the aircraft systems.  Engine control systems that are embedded in aircraft avionics may require special conditions as prescribed under §21.16. \\nPar 2-1 Page 2-1 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nb. Interface Description. The instruction manual should include installation interface \\ndescriptions, limitations, and requirements of the engine control system.  For example, the \\ninstruction manual should clearly define the EEC power requirements and quality, including interrupt limitations, for the engine installer.  The manual should also specify the impedance and buffering limitations for the signals provided by the EEC system for display and instrumentation, or signals used by the EEC, such as air data information, to ensure that the EEC system is adequately isolated and unaffected by other systems using these signals.\\n c. Operational Description.\\n (1) The instruction manual should:\\n (a) Describe the control system operating characteristics in both the normal and \\nalternate control modes.\\n (b) Define restrictions in the flight envelope or unusual operating characteristics in \\nthese alternate modes.\\n (c) Identify any abnormal control characteristics in all operational or dispatchable \\nconfigurations that could have an impact on crew procedures, training, workload, or any other aspect of aircraft performance or operating characteristics, for evaluation during aircraft certification.\\n         (2) If dispatch of the control system with faults has been approved by a time-limited\\xad\\ndispatch (TLD) analysis or other analyses, the instruction manual, or other appropriate \\ndocumentation, should include the time limitations for this type of operation.  If TLD or other appropriate analysis or documentation is not submitted to substantiate the acceptability of dispatching the engine control with faults present or portions of the control inoperative, the control may be restricted to “full-up” dispatch only.\\n (3) Faults that leave the control in a condition that cannot meet part 33 performance and \\noperability requirements are generally considered non-dispatchable.  The instruction manual should indicate how the EEC system would announce that condition to the flight crew.  It should also describe how the control system provides output information for such a condition.\\n (4) The instruction manual should describe the availability of information about ECO-\\napproved dispatchable fault conditions, and the time limits approved for such operations.  ECO approval of a particular fault condition as dispatchable does not guarantee that the ACO or the operator’s certificate management office will approve that same condition as dispatchable for the aircraft or operator. \\nPage 2-2 Par 2-3 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nd. Substantiating Data. The instruction manual should include data from analyses conducted \\nto comply with §§33.28(b) and (c), data from the environmental testing conducted to comply \\nwith §33.28(d), and data from the software level determinations conducted to comply with §33.28(e). This data will assist the installer in safely installing the engine.  The applicant should have available and provide, as required, the following specific data:\\n (1) Data for all operating modes, to demonstrate that the control meets its design intent.\\n         (2)   Data to show that a progressive means of increasing power or thrust with throttle or \\nload demand is provided for all control modes.\\n (3) Data for the following:\\n (a) The software level (for each function, if necessary).\\n              (b)   The estimated failure rates for:\\n 1.Engine shut-down in-flight due to engine control causes.\\n 2.Loss of engine or propeller control or significant change in power or thrust.\\n 3.Failures to the back-up system.\\n 4.Transmission of faulty parameters that affect cockpit located engine displays, or \\nother safety critical functions.\\n 5.Loss of any critical safeguards, such as overspeed or valves needed for fire \\nprotection.\\n 6.Loss of any aircraft-supplied data or power required to assure proper engine \\noperation.\\n 7.Other safety significant failure conditions, such as the probability of an \\nuncontrolled overspeed and the other control system associated events as determined from the system safety analysis (SSA).  A control system event is one that the control system causes or is involved in preventing.\\n (4) The types and levels of environmental exposure for which the EEC system has been \\nsuccessfully qualified; for example, vibration, temperature, HIRF, and lightning. For new applications of a previously certified control system, substantiation of the environmental capability of the EEC system by similarity analyses, as well as tests, may be acceptable.  The certification approach to be pursued should be indicated in the certification plan.  For HIRF, lightning and electromagnetic interference (EMI) qualification tests, the interfacing aircraft cables used for the tests should be described. \\nPar 2-3 Page 2-3 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\ne. Fault Accommodation Logic Data . The applicant should have available and provide, as \\nrequired, the following:\\n (1) A tabulation of the fault accommodation logic for the critical parameters used by the \\ncontrol; and\\n (2) A tabulation of the “default” or “fail-safe” states of all EEC system outputs, and the \\nrationale for their selection. \\nPage 2-4 Par 2-3 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 3.  SECTION 33.28(b) \\n3-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(b) provides that each EEC system: “Be designed and constructed \\nso that any failure of aircraft-supplied power or data will not result in an unacceptable change in \\npower or thrust, or prevent continued safe operation of the engine.” \\n3-2. Intent of Rule. Section 33.28(b) requires that the engine and control system continue to \\nfunction in a safe and reliable manner in the event of the failure of aircraft-supplied power or \\ndata, or both, while providing sufficient flexibility to accommodate the increasing engine and aircraft integration that accrues from the use of electronic control technology.  For single engine installations, the effects should be reviewed as part of the overall safety and reliability objectives of §33.28(b).\\n a. Unacceptable Change in Power or Thrust. An “unacceptable change in power or thrust” is \\na change that has a significant impact on the performance margins of the intended application. Although the complete or partial loss or change of thrust or power in a single engine installed on a multi-engine aircraft is not necessarily an unsafe condition, the ECO will evaluate both partial and complete loss of power or thrust.  This evaluation includes the frequency, duration, and percentage of power or thrust change that results from the failure of aircraft-supplied data or power.  This evaluation also considers location in the flight regime at the time of the event.  The applicant should provide analytical or test data for this evaluation.  The data may include worst case plots of percentage power or thrust change over the declared operating envelope for failure of aircraft-supplied data or power.\\n b. Continued Safe Operation of the Engine. In case of loss, corruption or failure of aircraft-\\nsupplied data or power, the engine should continue to function in a safe and acceptable manner, \\nwithout unacceptable effects on thrust or power, hazardous engine effects, or loss of ability to comply with the operating requirements of §§33.51, 33.65 and 33.73. \\nPar 3-1 Page 3-1 (and 3-2) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 4.  COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 33.28(b):\\n \\nFAILURE OF AIRCRAFT-SUPPLIED DATA\\n \\n4-1. Failure of Aircraft-Supplied Data. The following guidance provides a method, but not the \\nonly method, of compliance with §33.28(b) for failure of aircraft-supplied data.  The applicant \\nshould define in the instruction manual the effect of the failure of aircraft-supplied data on the engine’s output power or thrust characteristic throughout the flight envelope.  That data should be provided for all allowable engine control and aircraft dispatch configurations in which the loss of aircraft power or data in that dispatch configuration would result in a different engine control system response. \\n4-2. System Configurations. Examples of system configurations that have been found to be \\nacceptable under §33.28(b) include the following:\\n a. Dual Sources. A system may use dual sources of aircraft-supplied data with local engine \\nsensors provided as “voters” and alternate data sources.  Sensors that act as “voters” provide a \\nmethod for the EEC system to determine if one of the primary data sources is providing erroneous data, and to then eliminate that erroneous source from consideration.  In the event of a failure in the aircraft-supplied data, the engine sensors act as the primary source of sensed data through the fault accommodation logic.  In the event of the loss of this engine-sensed data, the system uses modeled or synthesized parameters.\\n b. Synthesized Engine Parameters. In some cases, a system may use synthesized engine \\nparameters as voters.  The applicant should provide data that gives the worst case percentage change of power or thrust over the declared operating envelope when inaccuracies of the synthesizing process are considered, as well as the environmental effects on the sensors used in the synthesis.\\n c. Third Source. A system may use a third source of aircraft-supplied data as the voter \\ninstead of engine sensors.  In this case, when aircraft data is used exclusively, the applicant should address the following items, as applicable, in the SSA or other appropriate documents:\\n (1) Software in the data path to the EEC should be at a level consistent with that defined \\nfor the EEC. The data path may include other aircraft equipment, such as aircraft air data computers (ADC), thrust management computers, or other avionics equipment.\\n (2) The applicant should state in the instruction manual that the aircraft manufacturer must \\nensure that changes to aircraft equipment, including software, in the data path to the engine do not affect the integrity of the data provided to the engine as defined by the instruction manual.\\n (3) If dispatchability of the aircraft without the third source is anticipated, the applicant \\nshould provide analysis that demonstrates the acceptability of this dispatch configuration for the minimum maintenance equipment list (MMEL) or the TLD documents, as applicable. \\nPar 4-1 Page 4-1 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\n(4) Since aircraft-supplied data has an effect on EEC system operation, the applicant \\nshould supply the effects of faulty and corrupted aircraft data on the EEC system in the engine \\ninstruction manual. In the three ADC configuration the EEC system could be significantly affected by erroneous or faulty air data information; the engine could experience a significant thrust or power change during such a condition.  If this is the case, the applicant should indicate in the instruction manual that air data information, and any other aircraft information that could have a significant impact on engine thrust or power, is considered critical to EEC system operation. Therefore, the instruction manual should state that the installer should ensure that those sensors and equipment involved in delivering information to the EECs are capable of operating in the “severe” HIRF and lightning environments, as defined in the certification basis for the aircraft, without affecting their proper and continued operation.\\n (5) The applicant should state the reliability level for the aircraft-supplied data that was \\nused as part of the SSA and LOTC analysis as an “assumed value” in the instruction manual. \\n4-3. Complete Loss of ADC Inputs. The applicant should provide fault accommodation logic \\nfor the complete loss of ADC inputs or other aircraft-supplied data, even though this loss may be \\nextremely improbable.  In this case, the applicant should conduct sufficient testing or analysis, or both, on the fault accommodated control mode to establish that the engine operating characteristics comply with all operability requirements of part 33. \\n4-4. Common Mode Faults. In the exchange of data with the aircraft, consideration should be \\ngiven to elimination of unacceptable common mode faults affecting the operation of more than \\none engine or propeller.  This AC describes limits for unacceptable common mode faults that affect power or thrust in the discussion of §33.28(c).  Common faults that affect engine protection limit systems or could hazard the aircraft would generally be unacceptable.  The applicant should demonstrate the logic included in the control system to accommodate common faults. Any precautions needed to address common effects should be taken either through the aircraft system architecture or by logic internal to the engine control system.  This should be demonstrated as part of the software integration testing during the EEC software verification or EEC system validation test program.  Specifically, the applicant should consider the following cases:\\n a. Erroneous data received from the aircraft by the engine or propeller control system, if the \\ndata source is common to more than one engine or propeller; for example, air data sources, autothrottle systems, and synchronizing controls.\\n b. Control system operating faults propagating through data links between engine or \\npropeller; for example, maintenance recording, common bus, cross-talk, auto-feathering, and automatic power reserve system.\\n c. Loss or interruption of aircraft data or electrical power used by the engine control, when \\nthat loss or interruption is caused by the failure of another engine. \\nPage 4-2 Par 4-2 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nd. Exchange of data between engines to implement control functions, (for example, load \\nsharing and synchrophasing) should be shown to incorporate authority limits to prevent \\nunacceptable common mode loss of power or thrust. \\n4-5. System Integration. The trend toward system integration may result in EEC systems that \\nuse resources distributed within the aircraft in addition to aircraft-supplied data.  In these cases, \\nthe office responsible for certifying the engine would expect the engine manufacturer to specify the requirements for the EEC system and substantiate the adequacy of those requirements.  The engine manufacturer should specify these requirements in the engine instruction manual to ensure that the engine certification basis is maintained.\\n     a. Integration Activities.\\n (1) Aircraft Functions Integrated into the Engine Control System.  This activity involves \\nthe integration of aircraft and propeller control functions (that is, those that have traditionally not \\nbeen considered engine control functions) into the EEC system’s hardware and software.\\n (a) Examples of this integration include: thrust reverser controls; propeller speed \\ngovernors, which govern speed by varying pitch; and ATTCS systems.  When this type of integration activity is pursued, the EEC system becomes part of, and should be included in, the aircraft’s SSA.  Although the aircraft functions incorporated into the EEC system may receive review at engine certification, the acceptability of the safety analysis involving these functions would be determined at aircraft certification.\\n (b) The EEC system may be configured to contain only part of the aircraft system’s \\nfunctionality, or it may contain virtually all of it.  Thrust reverser control systems are an example in which only part of the functionality is included in the EEC system.  In such cases, the aircraft is configured to have separate switches and logic (independent from the EEC system) as part of the thrust reverser control system.  This separation of reverser control system elements and logic provides an architectural means to limit the criticality of the functions provided by the EEC system.\\n (c) However, in some cases the EEC system may be configured to incorporate virtually \\nall of a critical aircraft function.  Examples of this “virtual completeness” in aircraft functionality are EEC systems that contain full authority to govern propeller speed in turboprop-powered aircraft and ATTCS systems in turbofan-powered aircraft.\\n 1.The first of these is considered critical because, if an engine fails, the logic in the \\nengine control must be configured to feather the propeller on that engine.  Failure to rapidly feather the propeller following an engine failure results in excessive drag on the aircraft; such a condition could be critical to the aircraft. \\nPar 4-4 Page 4-3 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\n2.The ATTCS system in turbofan-powered aircraft is considered critical because it \\nis required to increase the thrust of the remaining engine(s) following an engine failure during \\ntake-off.  The increased thrust on the remaining engines is necessary to achieve the required aircraft performance.\\n (d) All of these examples of integration involve aircraft functions that would receive \\nsignificant review during aircraft certification.\\n (2) Engine Control Functions Integrated into Aircraft Systems. The trend toward systems \\nintegration may lead to aircraft systems performing functions traditionally considered part of the engine control.\\n              (a)   Some limited designs may have functions traditionally considered part of the \\nengine control system provided by the aircraft, but the EEC system itself, which is part of \\nthe type design, provides all the functions required to safely operate the engine in accordance with parts 33, 35, and other applicable regulations.  An example of such a “limited design” is an engine control that receives a torque output demand signal from the aircraft and responds by changing the engine’s fuel flow and other variables to meet that demand.\\n (b) Other designs may use aircraft systems to provide a significant number of \\nthe engine control system functions.  An example of this design is the complex integration of flight and engine control systems (integrated in aircraft avionics units) that govern engine speed, rotor speed, rotor pitch angle, and rotor tilt angle in tilt-rotor aircraft.\\n (c) Functions provided by the engine system, which is part of the engine type \\ndesign, would be certified with the engine; functions provided by the aircraft would be certified with the aircraft.\\n (d) In these designs, aircraft systems may be an integral part of engine \\nregulatory compliance.  In such cases, the engine applicant should specify the requirements for the EEC system and substantiate the adequacy of those requirements. The applicant should define these requirements in the engine instructions for installation; the requirements would then become part of the engine type design. \\nPage 4-4 Par 4-5 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nb. Certification Activities.\\n (1) Objective. To satisfy the aircraft requirements (§§ 901, 903, and 1309 of parts 23, 25, \\n27, and 29), the consequences of failures of the engine control system on the aircraft must be \\nanalyzed.  The engine manufacturer and aircraft manufacturer should ensure that the software levels and safety and reliability objectives for the EEC system are consistent with the associated aircraft requirements.  The use of electronic technology consistently results in greater integration of engine, propeller, and aircraft systems.  For example, in some applications the EEC unit may integrate the control functions for the propeller, or the aircraft computers may integrate the engine control and the propeller control functions.  The appropriate engine, propeller, and aircraft certificating offices should define the respective certification tasks of the engine, propeller, and aircraft manufacturers.\\n (2) Interface Definition and System Responsibilities. Interface definitions and system \\nresponsibilities should be identified in the appropriate documents for the functional and hardware and software aspects of the engine, propeller, and aircraft systems.  The applicants should summarize these responsibilities in the respective engine, propeller, and aircraft certification plans. Specifically, the engine/propeller/aircraft documents should identify:\\n              (a) Functional requirements and criticality (that may be based on engine, propeller and \\naircraft considerations).\\n (b) Fault accommodation strategies.\\n (c) Maintenance strategies.\\n (d) The software quality level (per function if necessary).\\n              (e)   The reliability objectives for:\\n 1.LOTC events; and\\n 2.Transmission of faulty parameters.\\n (f) The environmental requirements, including the degree of protection against \\nlightning or other electromagnetic effects (for example, the level of induced voltages that can be \\nsupported at the interfaces).\\n (g) Engine, propeller, and aircraft interface data and characteristics.\\n (h) Aircraft electrical power supply requirements and characteristics (if relevant). \\nPar 4-5 Page 4-5 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\n(3) Distribution of Compliance Tasks.\\n (a) The tasks for the certification of the aircraft propulsion system equipped with \\nelectronic controls should be shared between the engine, propeller, and aircraft manufacturers. \\nThe manufacturers should identify the distribution of these tasks in their respective certification plans for the approval of the appropriate engine, propeller, and aircraft authorities.\\n 1.The aircraft certification should address the overall integration of the engine and \\npropeller in compliance with the applicable aircraft requirements.\\n 2.The engine and propeller certification plans should address the functional aspects \\nof the engine and propeller control systems for compliance with the applicable engine and propeller control system requirements.\\n (b) Evidence provided for engine certification could be used for aircraft certification, if \\nappropriate. For example, if the applicant has demonstrated the quality of any aircraft-implemented software and aircraft/engine interface logic for engine or propeller certification, additional substantiation for aircraft certification should not be necessary.\\n (c) For example, if an EEC unit were performing the functions for the control of the \\nengine and the functions for the control of the propeller:\\n 1.The engine certification would address all general requirements such as software \\nquality assurance procedures, EMI/lightning protection levels, and effects of loss of aircraft supplied power.\\n 2.The engine certification would address the functional aspects for the engine \\nfunctions such as safety analysis, rate for LOTC events, and effect of loss of aircraft supplied data. For example, the fault accommodation logic affecting the control of the engine would be reviewed at that time.\\n 3.The propeller certification would similarly address the functional aspects for the \\npropeller control functions.  For example, the fault accommodation logic affecting the control of the propeller would be reviewed at that time.\\n 4.In this example, the propeller functions and characteristics that the propeller \\nmanufacturer defines as provided by the engine control system would normally need to be refined during flight test.  However, the propeller manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that these requirements that would be certificated as part of the engine certification program, although not refined during flight test, define an airworthy configuration.  The Engine and Propeller Directorate Policy Regarding Integrated Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FADEC) and Electronic Propeller Control (EPC) Systems, dated June 30, 1995, provides additional clarification. \\nPage 4-6 Par 4-5 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\n5.All manufacturers involved should agree on the change control process, so that \\nchanges to the engine control system that affect the propeller system or changes to the propeller \\ncontrol system that affect the engine control system do not lead to an inadvertent change to the type design of either system.\\n (d) For example, if an aircraft computer were performing the functions for the control \\nof the engine, the propeller, or both:\\n 1.The aircraft certification would address all general requirements such as software \\nquality assurance procedures and EMI/lightning protection levels.\\n 2.The aircraft certification would address the functional aspects for the aircraft \\nfunctions.\\n 3.The engine certification would address the functional aspects for the engine \\nfunctions (such as safety analysis, rate for LOTC events, and effect of loss of aircraft supplied data). For example, the fault accommodation logic affecting the control of the engine would be reviewed at that time.\\n 4.The propeller certification would address the functional aspects for the propeller \\ncontrol functions (such as safety analysis, contribution to LOTC events, and effect of loss of aircraft supplied data).  For example, the fault accommodation logic affecting the control of the propeller would be reviewed at that time. \\n4-6. Fault Accommodation Logic. The applicant should perform an SSA to determine the \\nadequacy of the EEC fault accommodation logic.  The applicant should also demonstrate the \\nfunctionality of the fault accommodation logic; this demonstration may be conducted as part of the system integration testing. \\n4-7. Control System Elements Mounted in the Aircraft. Elements of the control system that are \\nmounted in the aircraft may be powered by and dedicated to the EEC, such as a throttle position \\ntransducer. In this case, the element would be considered an integral component of the EEC system, and faults should be accommodated as part of the EEC, rather than accommodated as aircraft-supplied data.  The applicant should document the method used for addressing single and dual failures of these signals and demonstrate the fault accommodation for these signals.  The demonstration may be conducted as part of the software integration testing during the EEC software verification testing. \\nPar 4-5 Page 4-7 (and 4-8) \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 5.  COMPLIANCE WITH SECTION 33.28(b):\\n \\nFAILURE OF AIRCRAFT-SUPPLIED POWER\\n \\n5-1. Failure of Aircraft-Supplied Power. The following guidance provides a method, but not the \\nonly method, of compliance with §33.28(b) for failure of aircraft-supplied power for engines \\nintended for multiple engine installations.\\n a. The applicant should demonstrate that the EEC control system can continue to function \\nnormally with the failure or interruption of aircraft-supplied power at any point within the declared engine operating envelope.\\n b. The capacity of any engine dedicated power source required for compliance with \\n§33.28(b) should provide sufficient margin to ensure that the engine control system would continue to function in all anticipated engine operating conditions in which the control system is designed and expected to recover engine operation in-flight.  This margin should account for any other anticipated variations in the output of the dedicated power source, such as those due to temperature variations, manufacturing tolerances, and idle speed variations.  The applicant should substantiate the design margin by test, analysis, or a combination of both.  This substantiation should consider deterioration over the life of the engine. \\n5-2. All Engine Out Restart Requirement. If aircraft-supplied battery power is required to meet \\nan “all engine out” restart requirement, an analysis should result in a definition of the \\nrequirements for this aircraft-supplied power.  In any application in which aircraft electrical power is used to operate the engine control system (such as low engine speed in-flight re-starting conditions), the effects of any aircraft electrical bus-switching transients or power transients associated with application of electrical loads, which could cause an interruption in voltage or a decay in voltage below that level required for proper control functioning, should be considered. \\n5-3. Exceptions. Some engine control functions that have traditionally relied exclusively upon \\naircraft electrical power are excepted from compliance with this aspect of §33.28(b) because \\ntheir good service history indicates they provide an equivalent level of safety.  The loss of power requirement of §33.28(b) applies to the ability to control the functions exempted, for example, anti-icing and ignition.  The exception applies only to the electrical power necessary to drive the function. The applicant should define in the instruction manual the impact of the failure of aircraft-supplied electrical power on the output power or thrust characteristics of the engine throughout the flight envelope.  The following are examples of these excepted functions:\\n a. Non-critical functions;\\n b. Engine start;\\n c. Ignition;\\n d. Thrust reverser; \\nPar 5-1 Page 5-1 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\ne. Anti-icing; and\\n f. Fuel shut-off. \\n5-4. Aircraft-Supplied Power as Backup Power. In the event of an alternator failure, aircraft-\\nsupplied power may be used as a source of backup power for the dedicated engine-mounted \\nalternator. If the control is not required to have a dedicated power source and uses aircraft power as its normal power supply (such as a system with a full hydromechanical back-up), and the transition from the electronic to the hydromechanical control is acceptable, then this does not apply. \\n5-5. Control Systems Integrated with Avionics. For control systems integrated with avionics, \\naircraft-supplied power may be used as primary power for the EEC.  The power should be able to \\nmeet the EEC quality and reliability requirements for operating the engine under all normal electrical load conditions (such as no dropout during engine/APU start and bus switching).  The EEC should also have backup power from a battery capable of allowing a safe landing after loss of all generators and alternators, without loss of engine control.  The required amount of battery backup power should be determined from the maximum certificated altitude of the aircraft and should include at least one missed approach and go-around. \\nPage 5-2 Par 5-3 \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 6.  SECTION 33.28(c) \\n6-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(c) provides that each EEC must: “Be designed and constructed so \\nthat no single failure or malfunction, or probable combination of failures of electrical or \\nelectronic components of the control system, results in an unsafe condition.” \\n6-2. Intent of Rule. Section 33.28(c) ensures that the complete engine control system, including \\nthe electrical and electronic parts, provides a system that is considered equivalent in safety and \\nreliability to engine control systems that are based on hydromechanical technology.\\n a. Current regulations (based on hydromechanical technology) rely on testing and mechanical \\ninspection intervals to ensure control system reliability and airworthy operation.  Electronic technology does not lend itself to mechanical inspection.  Therefore, to ensure safe operation after an electrical or electronic component failure, redundancy techniques and self-monitoring have been required in EEC systems to achieve equivalent control system integrity.  The predicted reliability of the control system should be determined by completing a loss-of-thrust-control (LOTC) analysis of the system.\\n b. Previous EEC systems have used the design approach of showing that the EEC system is \\nessentially single fault tolerant with respect to electrical or electronic failures when establishing safety and reliability equivalence to conventional hydromechanical systems.  The word “essentially” is used because it may not be practical to accommodate all failures.  In the TLD analysis a two to five percent default value is assigned in some cases to these uncovered faults for a full dual channel redundant system.  The value used should be substantiated by tests, analysis, or both. \\n6-3. Compliance with §33.28(c). The objective in accepting the transition from \\nhydromechanical control (HMC) technology to electronic control technology is to maintain at \\nleast an equivalent level of system reliability and safety.  The following guidance provides a method, but not the only method, of compliance with §33.28(c).\\n a. Engine Controls for Different Aircraft and Rotorcraft Applications.\\n (1) Part 25 Aircraft Applications (and Part 23 Aircraft Applications Certifying to Part 25 \\nRules) . For engines intended for use in transport aircraft, the criteria used in early certification \\nprograms to establish that an EEC had an equivalent level of safety and reliability to an HMC was that an EEC system should not cause more than one LOTC event per 100,000 engine operating hours.  In addition, compliance with an LOTC criteria of 100,000 hours per event would generally meet the aircraft level requirement of §25.1309(b)(1).  This section requires that any aircraft system failures that would prevent continued safe flight and landing of the airplane must be extremely improbable.  EECs that comply with the LOTC criteria should comply with this aircraft rule (that is, have a failure probability of 10\\n-5 for a flight duration of one hour that \\nwould yield the probability (10-5)2 for the failure of both EECs.  This is less than the 10-9 failure \\nlimitation described in AC 25.1309-1A for catastrophic failures.  Redundancy techniques may be \\nPar 6-1 Page 6-1 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nprovided in the system by electronic, HMC, or other means.  Generally, engines designed for \\ninstallation on transport category airplanes use a fully capable dual channel FADEC or a single channel FADEC with a fully capable HMC.\\n (2) Aircraft Applications Other Than Transport Category Aircraft. For applications other \\nthan transport category airplanes, such as general aviation aircraft certified under part 23 and both normal and transport category rotorcraft, certified under parts 27 and 29, the LOTC rate should be one event per 100,000 engine hours.  However, criteria other than this rate may be appropriate, depending on the reliability demonstrated by the previous control systems used on those engines and provided that in-service experience has proven the reliability of those previous systems to be satisfactory. In this case, a rate equivalent to that of the HMC systems of more than one event per 100,000 engine hours may be acceptable.  An LOTC rate of 40,000 hours has been shown to be acceptable for airplanes certified in the Normal, Utility, or Acrobatic categories under part 23.  In addition, it may be acceptable to modify the upper limit of the LOTC criteria from the 90% defined for part 25 applications to 85%.  This modification would be acceptable because the loss of one magneto in a dual magneto system for reciprocating engines has usually resulted in a maximum power loss of 15% and has historically been determined to be acceptable by the FAA in general aviation applications.  Applicants proposing alternate LOTC rates should comply with guidance for hazard levels for system failures applicable to EEC system installation (see AC23.1309-1C).  Turbine engine powered rotorcraft certificated under parts 27 and 29 have demonstrated a need for controls systems with a higher degree of integrity.  The 100,000 hours integrity level would be appropriate for these applications.\\n b. Alternate Mode(s). The EEC systems should be essentially single fault tolerant with \\nrespect to electrical or electronic failures.  In these systems, transfer to an alternate mode(s) should not be considered an LOTC event in the analysis, if the alternate mode(s) does not exceed the applicable LOTC guidelines in this AC.  A functionally dissimilar hydromechanical or electronic system with reduced capability may be used to achieve an acceptable system reliability rate.\\n (1) The acceptability of these alternate modes should be assessed based on the following \\ncriteria:\\n (a) Compliance of the alternate mode with the requirements of part 33.  Any exceptions \\nshould be identified and assessed with respect to proposed operational usage.  Backup or alternate modes should not result in an unsafe condition.\\n (b) The failure rate from the primary control mode to the alternate mode.\\n (c) The LOTC rate of the control system. \\nPage 6-2 Par 6-3.a. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\n(d) Pilot workload and performance during transition to or operation in an alternate \\ncontrol mode. This issue may need evaluation at the aircraft level.  The engine manufacturer \\nshould coordinate with the aircraft manufacturer and the ACO to determine if the alternate control modes comply with the applicable aircraft certification standards.  These issues have been significant for some programs.\\n (2) The applicant should consider the following factors in the design and evaluation of any \\nalternate control mode(s):\\n              (a)   Automatic protection from surge or lean limit blow-out.\\n              (b)   Acceleration and deceleration times.\\n              (c)   Altitude relight capability.\\n (d) Dormant failures of the alternate control mode and documentation of any automatic \\nor manual checks to ensure the availability of the mode.              (e)   Dispatchability, if any alternate modes are intended to be dispatchable.\\n c. Control System LOTC Analysis. The applicant should submit a system reliability analysis \\nto substantiate the LOTC rate for the control system.  The analysis should be a numerical \\nanalysis, such as a Markov model, fault tree or equivalent approach.  The applicant should consider the following guidance for LOTC analyses:\\n (1) The analysis should address all components in the system that could contribute to \\nLOTC events.  This includes all electrical, mechanical, hydromechanical, and pneumatic elements of the system.  This should also include aircraft signals or data used by the engine control when the failure or malfunction of those signals or data can contribute to LOTC events. The analysis should also include failures and malfunctions that contribute to the transmission of incorrect information if that incorrect information would lead to a flight crew initiated engine shutdown or thrust reduction to a level within the LOTC definition.  The fuel pump is generally not included, as it is usually considered part of the fuel delivery system.  The system definition includes those sensors or elements that may not be part of the engine type design, but are dedicated to the system and contribute to LOTC events.  An example of this is the throttle or power lever transducer, which is usually supplied by the installer.  The engine instructions for installation should include reliability and interface requirements for these other than engine type design elements.\\n (2) The analysis should consider all fault types, including both covered and uncovered \\nfaults.\\n         (3)   The airworthiness limitations section of the engine instructions for continued \\nairworthiness (ICA) should contain periodic maintenance actions necessary for finding and \\nrepairing both covered and uncovered fault conditions to meet the LOTC rate. \\nPar 6-3.b. Page 6-3 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nd. System Safety Analysis (SSA).\\n (1) The applicant should complete and have available for review and acceptance an SSA \\nfor the EEC control system, addressing all declared dispatchable control configurations.  Data \\nused in the SSA should be substantiated. The SSA should include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following events caused by engine control system malfunctions:\\n (a) Failures affecting thrust:\\n 1.Loss of the ability to modulate power or thrust between the selected idle and 90 \\npercent of maximum rated power or thrust at all operating conditions.  This failure mode is considered an LOTC event.  A fault that increases idle thrust too much may be a concern in the aircraft approach configuration, because it affects the aircraft’s ability to maintain the desired approach angle or glide-slope.  A fault that decreases idle thrust too much may affect cowl anti-icing and go-around thrust capabilities.  Therefore, while faults that result in not setting the proper idle thrust do pose a concern, small deviations from the correct, selected idle thrust due to small sensor errors, for example, should be acceptable.  The engine failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA) and the aircraft SSA should examine these conditions.\\n 2.Engine shutdown (a subset of all LOTC events).\\n 3.Unwanted changes in magnitude or direction of power or thrust.\\n 4.Instability in the control of a critical function.\\n (b) Transmission of faulty parameters, including engine indications such as oil pressure, \\nrotor speed, inter-turbine or exhaust gas temperature, or the engine’s thrust parameter.\\n (c) Unwanted action of a critical control function, such as deployment of reversers.\\n (d) Degraded capability of executing a critical function, such as failure to auto feather.\\n              (e) Inability of the engine to meet part 33 requirements, such as loss of engine \\nprotection features.\\n (2) When applicable, the SSA should also provide failure rates for loss of ancillary control \\nfunctions and engine indications that directly or indirectly lead to engine shutdown, such as the following:\\n              (a)   Stability augmentation.\\n (b) Oil, engine case, or component cooling. \\nPage 6-4 Par 6-3.d. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1 \\n \\n(3) The SSA should consider the extent of power or thrust changes resulting from \\nundetected faults:\\n (a) When operating in the take-off envelope, an uncovered fault in the control system or \\nundetected fault in an aircraft signal used by the engine control system that results in a thrust or \\npower change of greater than 3% thrust loss would generally be considered unacceptable for engines in installations that are required to meet part 25 requirements that include “obstacle clearance” requirements.  The 3% requirement may not apply to engines for parts 27 and 29 rotorcraft and part 23 (non-commuter) aircraft installations. The applicant should still ensure that the full-up system is capable of providing the declared minimum rated thrust or power during take-off. Such faults should be random and should be detectable and correctable during routine inspections, overhauls, or power-checks.  The applicant may have valid reasons for proposing thrust change levels that result from faults in aircraft-supplied data instead of the levels in this AC. In addition, the applicant may show that the particular guidance is not applicable to the specific engine installation.  The ECO will consider these proposals and decide for each program, on a case-by-case basis, if they comply with the definition of unacceptable change in power or thrust.\\n (b) Undetected faults in an aircraft signal that result in a thrust or power change greater \\nthan three percent should be declared in the approved engine instruction manual.  This data should describe the magnitude of the thrust or power change and the flight condition associated with the condition. Undetected faults resulting in thrust or power changes larger than three percent have generally been considered acceptable when operating outside the take-off envelope. In previous aircraft applications, these “outside the take-off envelope” thrust or power changes have been limited to less than approximately 15 percent and have been allowed in conditions involving high altitude, high-speed aircraft operations, or both.\\n (4) During take-off, detected faults in aircraft signals used by the engine control system \\nthat result in a thrust or power change of less than or equal to 10 percent may be acceptable if their frequencies of occurrence are relatively low.  In previous applications, frequencies of less than 10\\n-5 events per flight hour have been accepted.\\n         (5)   Single or multiple electrical or electronic failures, as well as hydromechanical system \\nfailures, that cause a greater than 10 percent change in power or thrust should be included in the control system’s LOTC analysis.  A safety factor or margin should be used for the frequencies of occurrences for single electrical or electronic failures that result in a greater than 10 percent thrust or power change when a field service database is not available to support the data used in the analysis.  A factor of two is typically acceptable. If a single electrical or electronic failure can result in an engine configuration that does not comply with part 33, this should be included in the SSA. The frequencies of occurrence of single electrical or electronic failures that cause thrust or power changes of less than 10 percent, but greater than three percent, or result in the engine not meeting part 33 requirements, should be approved by the ECO. \\nPar 6-3.d. Page 6-5 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\n(6) The SSA should provide an allowance for uncovered faults and their effects on the \\ncontrol system.  This acknowledges the potential presence of faults that can affect thrust or \\npower yet may not be recognized in the FMEA and SSA and, therefore, for which no fault accommodation is provided.  Uncovered faults that can have a greater than 10 percent influence on engine thrust or power could lead to LOTC events.  Therefore, the fault rate for these uncovered faults should be included in the LOTC analysis, and the rate used should be substantiated.\\n (7) If the SSA assumes that a particular crew action would reduce the impact of a fault \\ncondition, that assumed crew action should be clearly detailed in the instruction manual.  This crew action may need to be validated at the aircraft level during aircraft certification.  If the applicant requires a particular crew action to avoid an unsafe condition, the applicant should specify the display requirements associated with the failure condition in the instruction manual.\\n (8) The SSA should consider potential faults in aircraft wiring associated with the engine \\ncontrol. The engine instruction manual should state the effect of a grounding or over-voltage condition on any EEC system wiring caused by opens or shorts in that wiring to other aircraft wiring or structures.  The manual should also note any dispatch configuration in which the open, short, or over-voltage condition would cause an LOTC event.  In addition, opens and shorts in the engine harness wiring should be shown to result in a safe engine response by test, analysis, or both.\\n (9) The applicant should have an FMEA available for review.  The FMEA can be based on \\na piece part failure analysis or a functional analysis.  Since FMEAs are usually completed from a complete type design configuration, performing an FMEA by completing a piece part failure analysis on redundant electrical or electronic components may not be particularly useful because the result for most of these failures is “no effect.”  To understand the failure modes of a redundant EEC system, the intent of the propulsion control system FMEA should be to understand the system with regard to single failures.  The analysis should be focused on those single elements of the control that cause an impact on the control system and, therefore, on engine operation.  Single electrical or electronic and mechanical or hydromechanical failures that affect the operation of the control system are of particular interest.  These may include undetected or uncovered faults, as well as detected faults.  Mechanical or hydromechanical failures that cause the engine to possibly increase in power or thrust and disable or reduce the capability of a protective function, like the overspeed protective function, should be investigated, and the design should be altered or changed to avoid such a situation.  The FMEA should determine the criticality of single failures.  Single electrical or electronic and mechanical or hydromechanical failures that should be considered include those that cause the control system to:\\n (a) Change engine power or thrust;\\n (b) Not respond to throttle inputs;\\n              (c) Lose the capability of shutting off fuel; \\nPage 6-6 Par 6-3.d. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\n(d) Cause the engine to overspeed;\\n (e) Cause loss of a protective function;\\n (f) Cause the control to “fail fixed” or change modes; and\\n (g) Cause the control to fail to a state that requires pilot intervention.\\n e. Control Mode Transitions. Systems that use alternate control modes as a backup system, \\nincluding supervisory control systems , should incorporate automatic control features to transfer \\nto the alternate mode when electrical or electronic failures that are otherwise not accommodated \\nin the normal mode are detected.  In some applications a “fail fixed” fuel flow followed by a manually activated switch to the alternate mode has been accepted.  In these applications, there should be provisions for announcing the “fail fixed” condition to the flight crew by cockpit instrumentation. The alternate mode may be implemented using hydromechanical, electrical or electronic means, or any combination of these.  The power or thrust change associated with an automatic transfer to the alternate mode should be declared in the approved engine instruction manual. Generally, designs involving automatic transfers have been limited to thrust changes of less than approximately 10 percent.  Thrust changes greater than 10 percent have been accepted when they result from a crew-selected transfer.  Acceptable transition between all control modes should be demonstrated for engine certification.  During development, transition between control modes should be flight-tested, if possible.  If pilot action is required in the fault accommodation and transfer of control, the faults involved in such a situation should be declared in the engine instruction manual, and the condition(s) should be evaluated during aircraft certification.  For transfers that occur automatically, the following factors should be considered:\\n (1) The frequency of occurrence of transfers to any alternate control mode.  Computed \\nfrequencies of transfer to any alternate control modes should be supported with data from endurance or reliability testing, in-service experience on similar equipment, or other acceptable data.\\n         (2)   Faults that would result in transfer to any alternate mode, and the capability for \\ndetection of these faults.\\n (3) Self-test coverage and diagnostics.  Sufficient self-test coverage and diagnostics should \\nbe provided to enable detection of error conditions that are critical to system performance.\\n (4) Time delays in the transfer of control.  The engine instruction manual should indicate if \\nthere are time delays in the transfer of control.  The engine certification engineer may not be able \\nto determine that the mode transition provides a safe and acceptable system in accordance with part 33 based solely on analytical or simulation data.  In those cases, the applicant should propose a brief flight test program to support the data.  In any case, such control transition delays may or may not be acceptable for aircraft certification, depending on the installation.  Therefore, \\nPar 6-3.d. Page 6-7 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nthe engine manufacturer should coordinate with the aircraft manufacturer and the aircraft \\ncertification office to evaluate this configuration early in the program.  Control mode transitions should also be fully evaluated during aircraft certification.\\n         (5)   Availability of the alternate mode.  If the alternate mode is not exercised during normal \\nmode operation, an inspection interval or procedure for exercising the alternate mode should be \\nspecified to ensure that it remains functional and available. Inspection intervals or procedures may result in an operational limitation and will require the approval of the ECO.\\n (6) Provisions for signal(s) to indicate a mode transition.\\n f. Overspeed Protection System Requirements. For engine designs that require an overspeed \\nprotection control function, two categories of overspeed malfunction should be considered: those caused by shaft failure or loss of load, and those caused by control or fuel system failures.  For shaft failure cases, the engine design may have some alternate methods of protection against rotor overspeed to comply with §33.75, such as “blade-shedding” or a “mash-and-clash” turbine design.  In cases in which the basic engine design protects the rotor from an overspeed above structural limits, a control system overspeed protection system is usually unnecessary. If a control system overspeed protection function is necessary, the overspeed protection system should be evaluated with regard to its functionality and reliability as part of the engine control system.\\n (1) For overspeed protection systems, the following guidance provides one method, but not \\nthe only method, of compliance with both §§33.28 and 33.75.\\n (a) The combined engine and overspeed protection system should be at least two faults \\nremoved from a potential rotor burst event, when one of the faults induces the overspeed.  In this respect, a potential rotor overspeed burst should only be possible as a result of a first fault inducing an overspeed and an independent fault preventing the overspeed protection system from operating.\\n (b) The analysis should show that the probability per engine flight hour of an \\nuncontrolled overspeed condition from any cause in combination with overspeed protection system failure is one event per 100 million hours (a failure rate of 10 \\n–8 events per hour). Due to \\nthe severity of an uncontained engine failure in some installations, certification of the aircraft may require the rate for this combined event to be demonstrated to be less than one event per billion hours (10\\n–9).\\n (c) The failure rate of the overspeed protection system, itself, should be on the order of \\none event per 10,000 hours (E10-4).\\n              (d)   The probability of an inadvertent activation of the overspeed protection system \\nshould be commensurate with the fault consequences.  The LOTC analysis should include the frequency of inadvertent activations of the overprotection protection system that cause a greater than 10% thrust or power change. \\nPage 6-8 Par 6-3.e. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1 \\n \\n(e) Overspeed protection is a necessary function for dispatch, required by §§33.28(c) \\nand 33.75. Therefore, when the overspeed protection function is part of the control system, and \\nits implementation involves the use of electrical or electronic components, a self-test of the overspeed protection system to ensure that the system is functional before each flight should be performed. Verification of the overspeed protection system at engine shutdown of the previous engine run has been acceptable.\\n (f) When multiple paths can invoke the overspeed protection system, a test of a \\ndifferent path should be performed each engine cycle, so that a complete test of the overspeed system can be achieved in a minimum number of engine cycles.  If a path is found to be inoperative, the failure rate of the remaining path(s) should be less than 10\\n-4 failures per hour, \\nand combinations of failure leading to an uncontrolled overspeed event should still be extremely improbable. The control system should not be knowingly dispatched with the overspeed protection system failure rate greater than 10\\n-4 failures per hour, or if the system is known to be \\ninoperative.\\n (g) The applicant may provide data that demonstrates that the mechanical part of the \\noverspeed protection system, such as the fuel shut-off mechanism, can operate without failures between stated periods.  The applicant may also propose establishing a periodic inspection and test interval for the shut-off mechanism instead of testing the shut-off mechanism operation as part of the self-test conducted for each flight.  When this approach is used, the self-test conducted for each flight should be limited to the electrical and electronic components of the overspeed protection system.\\n (h) Use of shared resources between the control system and the overspeed protection \\nsystem should be evaluated.  An analysis should show that the probability of faults of shared resources that could cause or contribute to an overspeed event as well as inhibit the overspeed protection function is extremely improbable, that is less than one event per billion engine flight hours (10E\\n-09). Single failures should not cause such a condition.  The overspeed protection \\nsystem should be independent from the normal control.\\n (i) When the overspeed control function is implemented through mechanical or \\nhydromechanical means only, such as a fly-ball governor system, a periodic inspection and test interval for compliance with the requirement for “continued system availability” is acceptable. The periodic inspection and test interval should be based on test or in-service data that demonstrates that the system operates without failure between intervals.\\n (2) The overspeed malfunctions used in the failure analysis should be addressed when \\ncomplying with §33.27. \\nPar 6-3.f. Page 6-9 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01\\n     g.   Guidance for Use of Commercial or Industrial Grade Electronic Parts. Two recently \\npublished documents provide guidance on the application of commercial or industrial grade \\ncomponents: IEC/PAS 62239, Electronic Component Management Plans, edition 1.0, dated April 2001, and IEC/PAS 62240, Use of Semiconductor Devices Outside Manufacturers’ Specified Temperature Ranges, edition 1.0, dated April 2001.  These should be used with the following guidance.  When the engine type design specifies commercial or industrial grade electronic components, the applicant should have the following data available for review, as required:\\n (1) For each commercial and industrial grade electrical component specified in the design, \\nreliability data that substantiates the failure rate for each component used in the EEC reliability analysis and the SSA.\\n (2) Procurement, quality assurance, and process control plans established for the vendor-\\nsupplied commercial and industrial grade parts.  These plans should assure that the parts would maintain the reliability level specified in the approved engine type design.\\n (3) Unique databases for similar components procured from different vendors, because \\ncommercial and industrial grade parts may not all be manufactured to the same accepted industry standard, such as military component standards\\n (4) Substantiation that the proposed extended range of the specified components is suitable \\nfor the application, if the declared installation temperature environment for the EEC is greater than that of the electronic components specified in the engine type design.  Additionally, if commercial or industrial parts are used in an environment beyond their specified rating and cooling provisions are required, the applicant should specify these provisions.  Failure modes of the cooling provisions that cause these limits to be exceeded should be considered in determining the probability of failure.\\n h. Consideration of Local Events. When designing an electronic control system to meet the \\nrequirements of §33.28, the engine manufacturer should provide a control system with at least an equivalent level of safety and reliability as that of engines or propellers equipped with HMC systems.  HMC systems have been shown to perform safely and reliably in the face of “local events.” In some cases, a comparison to HMC systems is not practical because the EEC system either provides functions not previously provided by HMC systems or is implemented differently.  In these cases the acceptability of the effect of local events should be based on their effect on aircraft safe flight and landing.  Examples of local events include: engine overheating conditions or fires, electrical problems, hydraulic and lubricating fluid leaks, and mechanical disruptions.\\n (1) Whatever the local event, the behavior of the EEC system should not cause a hazard to \\nthe continued safe flight and landing of the aircraft.  Effects such as the control of the thrust reverser deployment, an overspeed of the engine, transients effects, or inadvertent propeller pitch change under any flight condition should be considered. \\nPage 6-10 Par 6-3.g. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1 \\n \\n(2) When demonstrating that local events do not cause a hazard to the continued safe flight \\nand landing of the aircraft, the applicant should show that any other function necessary to \\nprovide protection would be available at the time of the local event and would not be rendered inoperative by the same local event (such as destruction of wires, ducts, or power supplies).  This includes proposed designs in which the engine manufacturer assumes that the aircraft (or aircraft components) provides the necessary protection.  This engine failure modes effects and criticality analysis (FMECA) should document this assumption.\\n         (3)   When the temperature to which the EEC is exposed is greater than the maximum safe \\ndesign operating temperature declared by the engine manufacturer, an overheat condition results. \\nThe electronic portions of the control should not cause a hazardous condition when the EEC is exposed to a continuous overheat or over-temperature condition, such as a duct burst or leak within a nacelle. Specific design features or analysis methods may be used to show compliance with respect to the prevention of hazardous effects.  When this is not possible due to the variability or complexity of the failure sequence, acceptable testing may be required.  Computer simulation techniques similar to those discussed for fire testing have also been acceptable.  The compliance criteria requires that when the EEC system is exposed to an overheat condition, the system should not cause the engine to behave in an unsafe manner and should allow a safe engine shut down.\\n (4) To show compliance with fire as a local event, the EEC system must comply with fire \\ntest requirements when the system is located in a fire zone.  Fire zones are defined in the appropriate aircraft certification standards.  Fire requirements for the electronic parts of the EEC system are not covered precisely in the regulations with regard to the length of time they are required to function when exposed to fire.  Therefore, the FAA has developed compliance criteria for EEC systems.  When exposed to fire, the EEC system should allow a safe engine shut down without an unwanted action during the exposure that could become hazardous to the aircraft.\\n (a) The fuel handling parts of the EEC system, including the fuel shut-off valve (SOV), \\nshould comply with §33.17, which requires that these parts be fire resistant.  Section 33.17 requires that the engine design minimize the probability of the occurrence and spread of fire. Therefore, consideration should be given to those parts of the EEC system that control airflow, which could fail and contribute to the fire when the system is exposed to fire.\\n (b) In addition, §33.75 requires that fire cannot cause the engine to lose the capability to \\nshut down. For system designs that depend on electric power to actuate the SOV, high temperature wire or other protective means should be used to ensure that the capability to shut down the engine is maintained when the EEC is exposed to fire.\\n (c) To demonstrate compliance with fire resistance requirements, computer simulations \\nof EEC exposure to fire may be used instead of fire tests on production hardware.  Approved computer simulations should be validated by analysis, test, or both, including all assumptions upon which the computer simulation is based. \\nPar 6-3.h. Page 6-11 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\n(d) Hardware emulations for use in fire tests may also be acceptable.  Approved \\nhardware emulations should be validated by analysis, test, or both.\\n (e) The engine manufacturer should note that as part of aircraft certification for \\ntransport aircraft, the Transport Airplane Directorate (TAD) has required actual fire tests on all \\nelements of systems in which there is the potential for fire causing a catastrophic failure, such as elements that could cause a catastrophic reverser deployment or an uncontained rotor burst.\\n (5) The applicant should demonstrate by analysis or test that when any EEC system \\ncomponent input or output electrical connection opens or shorts to ground, the system behaves in a safe and predictable manner.  In addition, the applicant should show that any EEC system component connector that becomes disconnected while the engine is operating does not cause a hazard to the continued safe flight and landing of the aircraft.\\n (a) EEC aircraft interface wiring should be tested or analyzed for shorts to aircraft \\npower; these “hot” shorts should result in an identified and non-hazardous effect.  When aircraft interface wiring is involved, the installer should be informed of the potential effects of wiring faults on aircraft interface wiring in the engine instructions for installation.\\n (b) When physical separation of conductors is not practical, the engine manufacturer \\nand the installer should coordinate to ensure that the potential for common mode faults between engine controls is eliminated and that the potential for common mode faults between channels on one engine is minimized.\\n (6) The applicant should demonstrate by analysis or test that hydraulic or lubricating leaks \\nimpinging on the EEC control system do not cause a hazard to the continued safe flight and landing of the aircraft.\\n (7) The applicant should demonstrate by test, analysis, or both, that mechanical disruptions \\nthat could sever connections or damage EEC system components do not result in a hazard to the continued safe flight and landing of the aircraft.  The evaluation of this design feature is installation dependent in many cases; these considerations in the design for mechanical disruptions should be considered on a case-by-case basis. \\nPage 6-12 Par 6-3.h. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 7.  SECTION 33.28(d) \\n7-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(d) provides that each EEC must: “Have environmental limits, \\nincluding transients caused by lightning strikes, specified in the instruction manual.” \\n7-2. Intent of Rule. Section 33.28(d) ensures that the engine and control system meet acceptable \\nenvironmental operating conditions.  The instruction manual should clearly define EEC system \\noperational limitations, for the benefit of the engine installer, and provide assurance that the EEC system is functional in a reasonably designed aircraft environment. \\n7-3. Compliance with §33.28(d). The following guidance provides a method, but not the only \\nmethod, of compliance with §33.28(d).\\n a. General Test Requirements. Section 33.28(d) requires that the EEC system have \\nenvironmental limits specified in the engine instruction manual, including those associated with \\nlightning and high intensity radiated fields (HIRF).  Environmental tests conducted on an individual system component basis in accordance with test procedures defined in RTCA Document DO-160D (see AC 21.16D), or equivalent, have been acceptable, except for temperature variation, HIRF, and lightning tests.\\n (1) A minimum of 10 temperature cycles should be performed for temperature variation \\ntests.\\n (2) Adaptations and combinations of the test procedures in RTCA Document DO-160D \\nshould be used for the HIRF, lightning, and electromagnetic interference (EMI) system tests. The test procedures in RTCA Document DO-160D are directed toward tests of individual pieces of equipment rather than systems, such as EEC controls.\\n (3) EMI tests conducted in accordance with MIL-STD-461/462 have been accepted as \\nproviding procedures and test levels equivalent to those in RTCA Document DO-160D.  When the two test procedures differ for a particular test case, the more rigorous test procedure should be used unless use of the alternate test can be justified.  HIRF and lightning tests should be conducted using the procedures described in paragraphs 7-3.b., 7-3.c., and 7-3.d. of this AC.\\n (4) Environmental tests in accordance with MIL-STD-810E may be accepted instead of \\nRTCA Document DO-160D tests when the MIL-STD-810E tests are equal to or more rigorous than those defined in RTCA Document DO-160D.\\n b. System Test Configuration Considerations. EEC manufacturers and engine manufacturers \\nhave conducted HIRF, lightning, and EMI tests as system tests on closed loop laboratory setups. The closed loop setup is usually provided with hydraulic pressure to move actuators to close the inner actuating loops.  A simplified engine simulation may be used to close the outer engine loop. \\nPar 7-1 Page 7-1 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\n(1) Open Loop Laboratory Tests.  In some cases, open loop laboratory setups with EEC \\ntest software have been accepted.  If the applicant conducts open loop setups, the following \\nfactors should be considered:\\n (a) The EEC test software should be developed and implemented by guidelines defined \\nfor software levels of at least Level 2 or Level C, in RTCA Document DO-178A and RTCA Document DO-178B, respectively. In some cases, the application code should be modified to include the required test code features.\\n (b) The system test setup should be instrumented to monitor both the output drive \\nsignals and the input signals.\\n (c) Anomalies observed on inputs or outputs should be duplicated on the engine \\nsimulation to determine if the resulting power or thrust perturbations comply with the pass/fail criteria.\\n (2) Pass/Fail Criteria.  The tests should be conducted with the EEC system controlling the \\nengine at the most sensitive operating point, as selected by the applicant.  This may be a different operating point for the three different tests.  The system should be exposed to the HIRF, lightning, and EMI environmental threats while operating at the selected condition.  The pass criteria for HIRF and lightning is that there is “no effect” on the operation or operational characteristics of the system.  “No effect” is defined as less than \\n±2 percent of power or thrust \\nchange from the normal control governing capability for a period of less than one second.  For EMI testing, the limits selected from the appropriate section of RTCA/DO-160D should be used. The following results are considered test failures:\\n (a) Transfers to alternate channels, backup HMC systems, or reversionary modes.\\n (b) Component damage.\\n (c) Significant fault codes recorded in the fault memory.\\n (d) False fault announcements to the crew that could cause unnecessary or \\ninappropriate crew action.\\n (e) Erroneous operation of overspeed or reverser circuits.\\n c. HIRF Test Requirements. For HIRF testing, systems have been accepted for engine \\ncertification using an interim high energy radiated fields (HERF) policy memo dated December 5, 1989. That interim policy memo served as the basis for Notice N8110.67, Guidance for the Certification of Aircraft Operating in High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF) Environments, which was later reissued as N8110.71 in April 1998.  Using 100 volts per meter average from 10 KHZ to 18 GHZ is an acceptable level for conducting HIRF bench tests for systems that perform critical functions. For rotorcraft applications, the HIRF bench test level should be 200 volts per meter average from 10 KHZ to 18 GHZ. \\nPage 7-2 Par 7-3.b. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\n(1) The Engine and Propeller Directorate has used 200 volts per meter average over the \\nentire frequency range from 10 KHZ to 18 KHZ as the standard for testing EEC systems.\\n (2) At a minimum, the modulations specified in RTCA Document DO-160D, Section 20, \\nfor categories W or Y should be used.  Additional modulations based on the EEC operating \\nfrequencies or control loop bandwidth should be used for the system HIRF tests.\\n (3) In many cases, additional pulse modulation tests in the microwave range are specified \\nby the aircraft manufacturers.  These additional tests are generally at field levels in excess of 1000 volts per meter. Experience to date has shown that EECs that pass 200 volts per meter average will also pass tests at the higher pulse modulated field levels at the higher frequencies. However, it should not be assumed that the system is hardened to these levels without completing the high-level pulse tests.  Test procedures generally follow the guidelines of Section 20 of RTCA Document DO-160D.\\n d. Lightning Test Requirements. Lightning tests should follow the guidelines of AC 20-136 \\nand Section 22 of RTCA Document DO-160D.  Multiple stroke (MS) and multiple burst (MB) tests should be conducted on the system connected on the test bench (see paragraph 7-3.b. of this AC).\\n (1) EEC MS Lightning Tests.  Low-level lightning test(s) should be conducted to establish \\nthe engine cable shield current levels.  Low-level tests have been used to establish the waveforms and current levels coupled on to the cables for the MS tests.  The shield current level for large engines has been on the order of 1000 to 2000 amperes.  For smaller engines, shield current levels have been higher.  These levels are typically determined by low current level lightning tests on the engine without the full benefit of nacelle attenuation and, therefore, should be conservative. Although the shield current level is not a requirement of an MS lightning test, the applicant should demonstrate that it is a realistic level for the category of engine and its application.\\n (2) EEC MB Lightning Tests.  Past MB tests have been conducted using the chattering \\nrelay test defined in Section 19.3.4.1 of RTCA Document DO-160D.  However, the chattering relay test has been superseded by MB tests using Waveform 3 or Component H (see AC 20-136).\\n (3) EEC Pin Injection Tests (PIT).  PITs should be conducted on the EEC.  PIT levels \\nshould be appropriately selected from the tables of Section 22 of RTCA Document DO-160D. PITs should be conducted on other system components as required. \\nPar 7-3.c. Page 7-3 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\n(a) PITs should be used to verify that equipment does not exhibit permanent upset or \\ndamage when subject to the pin-injected transient waveforms.  During these tests, the transient \\nwaveforms are applied directly to the designated pins on the equipment connector, normally between each pin and the equipment chassis ground, as described in Section 22 of RTCA Document DO-160. This method assesses the dielectric withstand voltage or damage tolerance of the equipment interface circuit.  For equipment electrical interface circuits that are electrically isolated from the equipment chassis or grounds, the applicant can perform a dielectric withstand or high-potential (hi-pot) test that meets or exceeds the peak transient waveform voltage amplitude in place of the PIT.\\n (b) Equipment interface circuits with low impedance with respect to the equipment \\nchassis should be subjected to the PIT.  For pin injection purposes, low impedance should be considered less than 100 ohms at any frequency below 10 KHZ.  Shunt filters and transient suppression devices such as Tranzorbs(tm) normally produce low impedance to chassis to provide transient protection and should be subjected to the PITs at the selected waveform levels.\\n (4) Aircraft and Engine Certification Lightning Tests.\\n (a) For engine-mounted EECs, lightning tests conducted on an EEC system may be \\nadequate to cover aircraft certification, as well as engine certification, provided the aircraft-engine interface cables and current levels are adequately represented in the test.  The test levels should be at a level compatible with the installation.  The applicant and the ECO should mutually agree on the test level in the test plan.  To account for the aircraft contribution to the test levels, the applicant should coordinate with the ACO to determine a mutually acceptable test level for the category of aircraft involved.\\n (b) The engine manufacturer should note that each aircraft manufacturer installing an \\nengine must determine the levels to which the installed engine and EEC system will be exposed for the particular aircraft.  The aircraft manufacturer should demonstrate that these levels are \\nequal to or less than the levels used for engine certification testing. If the aircraft manufacturer cannot demonstrate this, then EEC system lightning tests may be needed to show compliance with aircraft certification standards.\\n e. Maintenance Requirements. Section 33.4 and Appendix A to part 33 require that the \\nengine manufacturer prepare ICA for all engine parts.  A maintenance plan must be part of the ICA.  Therefore, as part of the environmental protection system that is part of the engine type design and is used to protect the EEC system from HIRF and lightning, a maintenance plan must be provided to ensure the continued airworthiness of the installed systems.  Notice 8110.71 provides some guidance that can be used to meet the ICA requirement.  Maintenance requirements may include periodic inspections or tests for required structural shielding, wire shields, connectors, and equipment protection components.  The applicant should provide the engineering validation and substantiation of these maintenance requirements. \\nPage 7-4 Par 7-3.d. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nf. Environmental Testing . All components of the EEC system, including all electronics units, \\nsensors, harnesses, hydromechanical elements, and any other relevant elements or units, should \\nbe tested to establish that they will operate properly in their declared environment.  When applicable, tests defined in RTCA Document DO-160D have been accepted.  Environmental test plans should be approved by the ECO before the tests are conducted.\\n (1) Although environmental test limits are not specified in this AC, environmental tests \\nshould be representative of the environments that are expected to be encountered in the engine installation. Special attention should be given to any condition that could affect more than one engine or propeller control system, such as a faulty operation during hot day ambient conditions. The environment for which the component is qualified should be entered into the instruction manual and is considered an installation limitation for the installer.\\n (2) The applicant should prepare an environmental test plan summarized in an \\nenvironmental test matrix that defines the method to be used to qualify the component for each of the environments. The environments and test procedures defined in RTCA Document DO\\xad160D have been acceptable to the FAA for electrical and electronic components.  Generally, only the environments that are expected to be encountered should be tested.  The matrix can note other environments as “not applicable.”  The components should be qualified by test, similarity, analysis, or any combination of these.\\n (3) The applicant should provide the proposed test plan for approval before conducting \\ntests of fuel handling, hydraulic, and pneumatic components, such as the fuel metering unit (FMU) and actuators.  These components should be qualified by test, similarity, analysis or any combination of these. In some cases, the testing required for the engine block tests under §§33.49 or 33.87 may be adequate to qualify these components.  Otherwise, additional tests are required under §§33.28(d) and 33.91(a).\\n (4) The explosion proof testing verifies that a component cannot cause an explosion of \\nflammable fluids or vapors. If applicable, explosion proof testing may be performed as defined in Section 9 of RTCA DO-160. Section 9 of DO-160D applies to demonstrating compliance with §§33.28 and 33.91. DO-160D defines Environment I as equipment mounted in fuel tanks or within fuel systems and Environment II as an atmosphere in which flammable mixtures can be expected to occur as the result of a “fault causing spillage or leakage.”  These definitions for the equipment environment may not be in complete agreement with definitions for aircraft engine installations.\\n (a) For installations in designated fire zones as defined in §§23.1181, 25.1181, 27.1181, \\nand 29.1181, the fire zone should have extinguishing provisions so that the explosion proof test given by Section 9 of Environment II of DO-160D would be adequate.  However, flammable fluid leakage areas as defined in §25.863 and other sections may not have fire extinguishing provisions or any of the other safety requirements associated with fire zones, due to the assumption that there are no ignition sources in those areas.  In these cases, the applicant should be aware that the explosion proof test given by Section 9 of Environment I of DO-160D, \\nPar 7-3.f. Page 7-5 \\n\\n AC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nalthough not a requirement for engine certification, might be a requirement for aircraft \\ninstallation. The applicant may also demonstrate by test or analysis that the EEC system is not an ignition source.\\n (b) The applicant should state the type of explosion proof test that has been conducted \\nin the installation instructions. In addition, if the applicant anticipates installations in a zone where flammable fluid requirements may be imposed, the test or analysis that demonstrates that the EEC system is not an ignition source should be referenced or included in the installation instructions.\\n     g.  Time Limited Dispatch (TLD) Environmental Tests. Although TLD is not a requirement \\nfor certification, HIRF and lightning tests for TLD should be conducted with the tests conducted for certification.  To get approval for the use of TLD, applicants should demonstrate that dispatchable EEC configurations continue to meet the environmental requirements of the certification basis.  SAE Document ARP 5107 contains applicable TLD information.  For HIRF and lightning, applicants have usually determined that the single channel dispatch configuration is the worst case dispatch configuration; they have conducted HIRF and lightning tests with one channel inoperative to demonstrate compliance.  For other environments, the applicants have complied by analysis and statements of compliance. \\nPage 7-6 Par 7-3.f. \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nCHAPTER 8.  SECTION 33.28(e) \\n8-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(e) provides that each EEC must: “Have all associated software \\ndesigned and implemented to prevent errors that would result in an unacceptable loss of power or \\nthrust, or other unsafe condition, and have the method used to design and implement the software approved by the Administrator.” \\n8-2. Intent of Rule. Section 33.28(e) requires that electrical and electronic engine control \\nsystems have all associated software designed and implemented to prevent errors that would \\nresult in a unacceptable loss of power or thrust, or other unsafe condition, and have the method used to design and implement the software approved for the application. \\n8-3. Compliance with §33.28(e). The following guidance provides a method, but not the only \\nmethod, of compliance with §33.28(e).\\n a. Software Level Requirements. Software should be designed and implemented according \\nto the standards established as Level 1 or Level A, as provided in RTCA documents DO-178A \\nand DO-178B, respectively; the applicant should complete any additional testing required by the Administrator. RTCA Document DO-178A has been superseded by RTCA Document DO178B; engine certification projects with a date of application after January 11, 1993, should use RTCA Document DO-178B.  Part 23 applications not intended to be certificated to part 25 requirements should use the standards of DO-178B level B or C for the control.  The applicant should coordinate this with the airframe manufacturer and the ACO early in the certification program.\\n b. Software Partitioning . It may be possible to partition non-critical software from the \\ncritical software to allow the non-critical software to be designed and implemented at a lower level than that established in the RTCA documents. Applicants should substantiate the adequacy of the partitioning method and should consider if the lower levels of the partitioned software are appropriate for the anticipated installations.  If the criticality level requirement were higher in subsequent applications, it would be difficult to raise the software level without repeating the software life cycle processes for the new level.\\n c. Software Integrity .  RTCA Document DO-178B provides guidance for software used at \\nspecified hazard levels.  As with all guidance in this document, this may be modified due to future events or advancements in technology.\\n d. Programmed Logic Devices. Due to the nature and complexity of systems containing \\ndigital logic, programmed logic devices should be developed using a structured development approach, equivalent to the hazard associated with failure or malfunction of the system in which the device is contained.  Programmed logic devices include application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) and programmable logic devices (PLDs).  An ASIC is defined as any masked programmed integrated circuit that requires physical customization of the device die by an ASIC \\xad\\nPar 8-1 Page 8-1 \\nAC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nvendor. Gate array, cell-based and custom designs are included, as they involve some level of \\ncustomization of the mask sets used in the fabrication of the devices.  A PLD is defined as any device that is purchased as an electronic part and altered to perform an application specific function. PLDs usually require programming by the equipment manufacturer.\\n         (1)   PLDs include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n (a) Programmable array logic (PAL) devices;\\n (b) Programmable logic array (PLA ) devices;\\n (c) General array logic (GAL) devices;\\n (d) Field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices; and\\n (e) Electrically or erasable programmable logic devices (EPLD).\\n (2) RTCA Document DO-254 provides guidance for the criticality, failure condition \\ncategories, and design assurance levels associated with development of programmed logic \\ndevices.  This is an acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance with §33.28(e).\\n (3) For off-the-shelf equipment or modified equipment, service experience may be used to \\ndemonstrate compliance.  This should be acceptable if the worst case failure or malfunction of the device for the new installation is not more severe than that for the original installation of the same equipment on another application.  The applicant should also consider significant differences related to the environmental or operational category of the aircraft in which the original system was installed and certified. \\nPage 8-2 Par 8-3 \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 6/29/01 AC 33.28-1\\n \\nAppendix 1 \\nAPPENDIX 1.  REGULATORY BASIS FOR REQUIRING\\n \\nAN EEC SSA AND LOTC ANALYSIS UNDER §33.28\\n \\n1. This appendix explains the basis for requiring an SSA as part of an applicant’s demonstration \\nof compliance with §33.28. Before §33.28 was added to part 33, EEC systems were certified \\nonly upon demonstration of complete redundancy in the electronic portions of critical loops of the system.  Applicants that did not perform an SSA were required to demonstrate sufficient similarity to earlier EEC accepted designs that had adequate redundancy.  Section 33.28 codified for general applicability the practices used in these early EEC engine certification programs.  If changes in EEC design make it no longer possible to accept EECs based on similarity with earlier accepted designs, then future applicants must, in order to demonstrate compliance with §33.28, submit an SSA for each EEC design. \\n2. The FAA will accept new technologies on the basis that the safety and reliability of that new \\ntechnology are equivalent to, or an improvement over, current technologies.  On this basis the \\nEECs were accepted in place of HMC designs after establishing the basis for comparison as one LOTC event per 100,000 hours of service.  An LOTC event is one in which there is a loss of the ability to control engine thrust from flight idle to 90 percent of maximum rated thrust.  This basis for comparison was established after extensive review, by FAA and industry, of in-service reliability data of existing engine control systems.  The results of that review were documented in issue papers and technical memoranda. \\n3. To meet this reliability standard, early EEC systems were designed with dual channel \\nredundancy from the sensed inputs to the dual output devices for the critical control loops, \\ndefined as the fuel, stator vanes, and bleed control loops.  Parts of the engine control system that remained with HMC technology generally were not made redundant. \\n4. A means, but not the only means, of compliance with §33.28 is provided in this AC through \\nanalysis that demonstrates that the proposed EEC system meets the LOTC criteria and that the \\nEEC system has adequate redundancy and fault accommodation. \\n5. Section 33.28 provides that “no single failure or malfunction or probable combination of \\nfailures of electrical or electronic components of the control system, results in an unsafe \\ncondition.” The term unsafe condition as used in this context is not limited to those specific conditions described in §33.75. While changes in thrust alone, however, will not always constitute an unsafe condition, the FAA will continue to evaluate unwanted changes in thrust or power with regard to the frequency of those events, their magnitude, and their occurrence in the flight envelope in determining whether an LOTC constitutes an unsafe condition for a particular engine design.  New technology electrical and electronic EEC systems introduce potential failures that could result in unsafe conditions requiring an SSA under §33.28.  Those failures include, but are not limited to, the following:\\n a. Complete loss of control over the engine.\\n b. Instability in the control of a critical function of the engine. \\nPage 1 \\nAC 33.28-1 6/29/01 \\nAppendix 1 \\nc. Unwanted change in magnitude or direction of power or thrust in some operating \\nconditions.\\n d. Unwanted action of a critical control function, such as the uncommanded deployment of \\nthrust reversers. \\n6. Early EEC system designs have full redundancy on electronic parts of the system that control \\ncritical loops and, therefore, were found to provide reliability equivalent to the HMC systems \\nthey replaced based on the established reliability criteria of one LOTC event in 100,000 hours of service. These systems are essentially single fault tolerant.  They cannot be considered fully single fault tolerant because a small percentage of failure types either cannot be addressed or are not detectable and as such cannot be accommodated.  Using this criteria, subsequent systems can be accepted based on their similarity in design with these early redundant EEC systems.  In recent certification programs, however, applicants have proposed engine designs using EEC systems that offer less than full redundancy. In these newer EEC designs significant unwanted changes in thrust or power could occur as a result of single system failures.  Therefore, since these newer systems were not similar in design and did not meet the LOTC reliability criteria equivalent to HMC systems, the FAA could not accept these systems without an SSA to demonstrate compliance with §33.28. \\n7. The FAA has recognized that a uniform method for demonstrating how newer EEC systems \\ncomply with §33.28 would both promote safety in air commerce and aid industry.  This AC \\nprovides that method based on meeting the LOTC reliability criteria for HMC designs through tests, analysis, or both.  The FAA also recognizes that the LOTC reliability criteria for HMC designs was established through review of service experience data for aircraft certified under part 25 only, and an acceptable reliability criteria for aircraft certified under other standards (parts 23, 27 or 29) may differ from the part 25 criteria.  Applicants are cautioned, however, that engines certified under part 33 are generally not restricted to a specific operational use.  Therefore, the FAA may have to apply the more conservative part 25 criteria in a particular certification program if it determines that the engine involved in that program may be eligible for installation on an aircraft that may be certified under part 25. \\nPage 2 \\n \\n      \\nSubject:  GUIDANCE MATERIAL FOR  \\n14 CFR §33.28, RECIPROCATING ENGINES, \\nELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONI C ENGINE \\nCONTROL SYSTEMS.

EEC technology was initially applied to turbine engines designed for large transport \\naircraft applications.  Th erefore, th e infor mation and guidance for showing com pliance with \\n§33.28 provided by the F AA was oriented toward th ese applications.  However, the increasing \\nuse of EEC system s in reciprocating piston engi nes has created a need for guidance s pecifica lly \\nfor reciprocating engines.   \\n \\n     b.  The application of  electronic tec hnology to reciprocating engine control system s \\nintroduces system s safety considerations: \\n \\n         (1)  A greater dependence of the engi ne on aircraft system s due to the use of electrical \\npower or data supplied from  the aircraft; \\n \\n         (2)  A risk of signif icant failures co mmon to m ore than one engine of the aircraft that \\nmight, for e xample, occur as a result of the following: \\n \\n              (a)  Insufficient protection from  electrom agnetic disturban ce (lightning, internal or \\nextern al radiation effects ); \\n \\n              (b)  Insufficient inte grity of the aircraft electrical power supply; \\n \\n              (c)  Insufficient in tegrity of  data supp lied from the aircr aft; \\n \\n              (d)  Hidden design faults or discrepancies contained within  the design of the propulsion \\nsystem  control software; or \\n \\n              (e)  Om issions or errors in the system /software specification.  \\n \\n     c.  This AC provides guidance an d acceptable m ethods, but not th e only methods, for \\ndemonstrating com pliance with §33.28 that address these issues.  This guidance is consistent \\nwith the FAA objectiv e of isolat ing the engine from  the effects of airplane system  failures. \\n \\n1-2.  Limitations .  The engine Type Certificate Data Sh eet (TCDS) or engine Supplem ental Type \\nCertificate (STC) issued by the FAA upon approv al of an EEC system  substantiated in \\naccordan ce with this AC  should specify the follo wing lim itation: \\n \\n“Installation of this engine is not appr oved for airplanes certificated under part 23 \\ncommuter or part 25 transport categories.” \\n \\n1-3.  Definitions.  The following definitions apply to reciprocating engines and m ay not be \\nappropriate for turbine engines. \\n \\nPar 1-1  Page 1 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n     a.  Aircraft-Supplied Data.  Aircraft-supplied data is inform ation that is generated in the \\naircraft system s and use d by the engine control system , but whose source is not controlled under \\nthe design authority of the engine  certification a pplican t.  Th is does not include input from  those \\nsensors that are used by, and norm ally dedicate d to, the engine control system  but m ay be \\nmounted in the airfram e. \\n \\n     b.  Aircraft-Supplied Power.  Aircraft-supplied power is any elec trical power source that is an \\nintegral part of the aircraft electrical system  and whose primar y function is to power aircraft \\nsystem s (for exam ple, an electrical b us). \\n \\n     c.  Alternate Control Mode(s) .  For the purposes of this A C, an alternate control m ode is \\ncharacterized by engine control operating characteristics or capa bilities that are sufficiently \\ndifferent from the “normal m ode” and m ay signifi cantly affect the operating characteristics or \\ncapabilities of  the airc raft, crew workload, or an ything th at constitu tes ap propria te crew \\nprocedures.  \\n \\n     d.  Back-up System.  A back-up system  is a different type of system  that is used as a stand-by \\nor alterna te contro l mode to the p rimary or norm al control m ode or system. \\n \\n     e.  Commercial and I ndustrial Grade Electronic Parts .  Comm ercial and industrial grade \\nelectronic p arts are not manufacture d to m ilitary  standard s. \\n \\n     f.  Degraded System or Configuration .  A degraded system or conf iguration is an EEC system \\nthat has faults or failures present that have no effect on engine operation but m ay cause a loss of \\nredundancy in the system. \\n \\n     g.  Destructive Event.  A destructive event is any m alfunc tion or failure of the EEC system  \\nthat could result in a condition in which the engi ne, or any of its com ponents, causes physical \\ndamage to the airplane structure or its occupant s that could potentially im pact continued safe \\noperation of the airplane.  For exam ple, engine  separation from its m ounts, uncontrolled fire, \\ninability to s hutdown the engine, gen eration of toxic products , or destructive engine ex plosion. \\n \\n     h.  Electronic Engine Control (EEC) System .  The EEC system  consists of system s or \\nsubsystem s, with f ull or lim ited-autho rity functional capability, whic h have the following \\ncharacteristics:  \\n \\n         (1)  Modulation of one or m ore engine control param eters; \\n \\n         (2)  Logic that discrim inates the de sired condition of an engine control param eter; and \\n \\n         (3)  Electronic im plem entation of logic. \\n \\n     i.  Failure Condition .  A failure condition is an abnorm al or non-operating state of the engine \\nthat is caused by or contributed to by  one or m ore faults or failures. \\n \\n     j.  Failure Event.  See definition for “failure co ndition. ” \\nPage 2  Par 1-3 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n \\n     k.  Fault or Failure.  A fault or failure is an o ccurrence that affects the operation of an engine \\ncomponent, part, or elem ent so that it cannot f unction as intended (thi s includes both loss of \\nfunction and m alfunction).  Software errors m ay cause failures, but are not considered faults. \\n \\n     l.  Fault or Failure Accommodation.  This te rm ref ers to the  capability o f the contro l system  or \\nflight cr ew to m itigate, e ither entire ly or in par t, the f ault or failure. \\n \\n     m .  Fault or Failure Detection.  This term  refers to the discovery of a fault or failure or the \\nresulting condition. \\n \\n     n.  Full Authority Digital Engine Control (FA DEC).  FADEC is an engine control system  in \\nwhich the prim ary functions are provided usi ng digital e lectronics and the EEC unit has f ull-\\nrange authority over the engine power.  \\n \\n     o.  Full-up System or Configuration .  The full-up system  or configuration is an EE C system  \\nthat has no faults or failures present, detected or undetected, that affect  the control of engine \\npower, engine protection system s, indication of critical engine operating param eters or other \\nsafety features of the engine control system . \\n \\n     p.  Local Events.  Local events are failures of aircraft  system s and components, other than the \\nEEC system, that m ay affect the installed env ironment of  the EEC. \\n \\n     q.  Loss of Power Control (LOPC).  LOPC is an EEC f ailure even t resulting in the inability to \\nattain at least 85% of rated power, or the inability to m odulate power at all norm al operating \\nconditions. \\n \\n     r.  Minor Power Loss (MPL).  MP L is an EEC f ailure ev ent resulting in the ability to  attain \\ngreater than 85%, but less th an 95%, of rated power.    \\n \\n     s.  Primary Mode .  This is the m ode of operation intended to control the engine.  This is often \\nreferred to as the “norm al mode.” \\n \\n     t.  Programmed Logic Device.  A programm ed logic device is a custom  micro-coded \\ncomponent, such as application specific integr ated circuits (ASIC) or programm able logic \\ndevices (PLDs). \\n \\n     u.

SECTI ON 33.28(a) \\n \\n3-1.  Rule Text.  Section 33.28(a) provides that each EEC system : “Have the control system  \\ndescription, the percent of ava ilable power or thrust controll ed in both norm al operation and \\nfailure conditions, and the range  of control of other controll ed functions, specified in the \\ninstruction m anual required by §33.5 for the engine.” \\n \\n3-2.  Intent of Rule.  Section §33.28(a) requires the applicant to provide the engine installer with \\nenough inform ation about the EEC system  to integrate the E EC-equipped engine system  into the \\nairplane design.  A successful propulsion system  installation requires a clea r understan ding of all \\naspects of the control system  in nor mal and a lternate con trol modes.  The instruction m anual \\nspecified in §33.5 includes both installa tion and operation instructions.   \\n \\n     a.  General.  To show com pliance with 33.28(a), th e applicant m ay subm it installation and \\noperation manual sections for the engine m anual or separ ate insta llation and operation manuals \\nfor the EEC system .  The m anual(s) should include descriptive, interface, and operating data in \\nenough detail to support airplane ce rtification.  Lim itations specifi ed in the m anual(s) should be \\nconsistent w ith those stated on the type cer tificate data sh eet (TCD S), amended TCDS, or \\nsupplem ental type certificate (STC ), as applicable.  These instal lation and operation instructions \\n(or a sep arate Certification Data  Interface Docum ent) should also include the cert ification data \\nspecified in section 3-3d of this  AC, to ensure that the part 33 certification is not invalidated \\nwhen the en gine is inst alled on the airplane.   \\n \\n     b.  Airplane Installation and Certification.  Subpart E of part 23 provides regulations for the \\ninsta llation of  a certif icated engin e into an airp lane.  The installed engi ne is defined as the \\npowerplant system .  These regulat ions require that the powerplan t system design m eet all the \\nrequirem ents, procedures, lim itations, and assump tions specif ied in the engine instruction \\nmanual and the engine TCDS or STC.  The app licant should coordinate this data with the \\nprospective airplane designer and the appropriate FAA certif ication of fice.  If  the applic ation is \\nunknown or not defined at the tim e of engine certification, the EEC system applicant should \\nsubstantiate any installation and operational a ssumptions m ade during the EEC system design.  \\nAs part of the airplane certific ation program , the FAA m ay require flight-testing to f ully evalua te \\nengine perform ance and operability charac teristics for all operating m odes.  See §23.939. \\n \\n3-3.  Guidance.  The following is a m ethod, but not  the only m ethod, for dem onstrating \\ncompliance with §33.28(a).   The applicant should include this da ta in the engine installation and \\noperation in structions su bmitted to s how com pliance with §3 3.5.  See appendix 1 for a lis t of \\ncompliance docum ents that m ay be subm itted f or this se ction.  \\n \\n     a.  Control System Description .  The applicant should incl ude a brief  control system  \\ndescription in the instruction m anual and m ay refe rence a m ore detailed system  description.

Installation Requirements.  The instruction  manual sho uld spec ify all of  the phy sical, \\nelectrical, and functiona l insta llation r equirem ents and lim itations of the EEC system .  For \\nexam ple, the instruction m anual should include: \\n \\n         (1)  Electrical Interface.  Th e instruction m anual should define the following: \\n \\n              (a)  EEC system electri cal power requirem ents and quality, including interrupt \\nlimitations, and grounding requirements.  This s hould also include stead y-state and transient \\nunder-voltage and over-voltage lim its for the equi pment.  The power input requirem ents of DO-\\n160D, Section 16, provide an accep table definition of such requirem ents.  If DO-160 is used, th e \\nmanual should state any exceptions to the power quality requirem ents cited in DO-160 for the \\nparticular category of equipm ent specified. \\n \\n              (b)  Im pedance and buffering lim itations for the signals prov ided by the EEC system  for \\ndisplay and instrum entation. \\n \\n              (c)  Signals used by the EEC sy stem , such as air data infor mation, to ensure that the \\nEEC system is adequately isolated and una ffected by other system s using these signals. \\n \\n              (d)  Im pedance, buffering, and range limitations for aircraft  data signals used by the \\nEEC system. \\n \\n              (e)  Subtle in terface requ irements, such as power interrupt tolerance of the EEC system . \\n \\n              (f)  EEC system power supply requirements and back up power reliability, if th e backup \\nelectrical supply is not ce rtified as part of the engine.  The manual shou ld clearly s tate that the \\nbackup electrical supply should be  independent and isolated from  the airplane bus system  or \\nsystem s. \\n \\n              (g)  Enduran ce of the battery, if a ba ttery is certified with th e engine as a source of \\nelectrical power for the EEC syst em.  The endurance of the battery should be consistent with the \\nairworthiness standards a pplicable to the intende d installation.  The m anual should also specify \\nprovisions for m onitoring the hea lth status of the battery.   \\n \\n         (2)  En gine control lever(s) inte rface requ irements, including electrical and m echanical \\ncharacteristics. \\n \\n         (3)  Unique fuel system  requirem ents, such as f iltratio n and f uel inlet cond itions (flow and \\npressure). \\n \\n         (4)  Any unique engine inst rumentation cockpit display requirements.  \\n \\nPage 8   Par 3-3 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n     c.  Operational Requirements.  The instruction  manual sho uld contain a description of the \\ncontrol system operating proce dures and lim itations in both th e norm al and alternate control \\nmodes.  For exam ple, the instruction m anual should provide:  \\n \\n         (1)  Restrictions in  the flight envelope or unusual operating characteristics in these alternate \\nmodes.   \\n \\n         (2)  Abnorm al control characteristic s that could have an im pact on crew procedures, \\ntraining, workload, or any other as pects of aircraf t perform ance or  operating characteristics, for \\nevaluation during airc raft certification.  \\n \\n         (3)  Control system  output inform ation to the cockpit, su ch as fault indication or control \\nmode status.  \\n \\n         (4)  General inform ation to help  the pilot de termine th at the engine is actually producing \\nthe comm anded power, s uch as the p ercent of av ailable power in both norm al operation and any \\nalternate m odes. \\n \\n         (5)  General inform ation associated with engine para meters that have lim iting functions, \\nincluding range inform ation on those param eters.  The instruction m anual should specify those \\nparam eters that ar e within the pilot’ s contro l (suc h as engine rpm ) and thos e tha t are n ot (such as \\nfuel flow, manifold air pressure (MA P), cylinder head tem perature (CHT), exhaust gas \\ntemperature (EGT) ), as well as rang e of control.  \\n \\n         (6)  General inform ation associated with op eration le an of the EGT peak, including the \\nallowable CHT or EGT range and transient behavior.  \\n \\n         (7)  General info rmation about autom atic engine lim iting functions independent of the \\npropeller governor, such as speed, MAP, CHT,  and EGT.

If a pplicable, the instruction m anual should identify the \\noperating lim itations associated with EEC system faults such as: \\n \\n              (a)  Unlim ited operation; \\n \\n              (b)  Tim e-limited operation (TLO); and \\nPar 3-3  Page 9 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n              (c)  No take-of f perm itted.  \\n \\n     d.  Certification Data Interface Docum ent (CDID) .  The applicant should subm it a docum ent \\nthat includes data from  safety analyses, envi ronm ental testing, and software validation and \\nverification that is neces sary fo r system s analysis  of the power plant installation and any other \\nassociated aircraft system.  In lieu of a separa te docum ent, this data m ay be included in the \\ninstruction m anual.  If the appli cant subm its this data in a sep arate document, the instructions for \\ninstallation should reference the docum ent to ensure that the data is integrated into the airplane \\ndesigner’s powerplant system  safety analysis.  The CDID should include, but is not lim ited to, \\nthe followin g specif ic data:  \\n \\n         (1)  Failure of Aircraft Power An alysis.

Section 33.28(b) provides that each EEC  system :  “Be designed and constructed \\nso that any failure of aircraft-s upplied power or data will not resu lt in an unacceptable change in \\npower or thrust, or prevent conti nued safe operation of the engine.” \\n \\n4-2.  Intent of Rule.  Section 33.28(b) requires that the EEC  system  maintain a level of self-\\nsufficiency and isolation from  the aircraft, or ensure a level of redundanc y, that will enable the \\nEEC system to accommodate aircraft electrical a nd data system  failures.  Convention al magneto \\nignition and m echanical fuel system s curren tly ha ve the cap ability to acco mmodate these aircraft \\nfailures.  \\n \\n4-3.  Guidance.  The following is a m ethod, but not  the only m ethod, for dem onstrating \\ncompliance with §33.28(b).  See appendix 1 for a list of com pliance docum ents that m ay be \\nsubm itted f or this sec tion. \\n \\n     a.  General. \\n \\n         (1)  Any LOPC event represents an unacceptable change in power.  Therefore, the \\nobjective of both analyses described in this chapte r should be to substantia te that the failure of \\naircraft-supplied power or data  does not cause an LOPC. \\n \\n         (2)  However, aircraft-supplied power or data failure events that re sult in engine effects less \\nsevere than an LOPC, such as an M PL, do not  represen t unacceptab le changes in po wer.  The \\nanalyses in this chap ter and the ins tallation ins tructions should identify these types of events \\nalong with their effect on engine operation.  Th is data can then be used in the powerplant \\ninstallation safety analysis requi red under the airplane airworth iness standards of part 23 to \\nevaluate the im pact of thes e failures on airplane operation. \\n \\n     b.  Failure of Aircraft-Supplied Power.  The applicant should provi de an analys is, validated \\nby engine or bench testing, that substantia tes the f unction of the EEC system with a failure or \\ninterruption of an aircraft-supplied power sour ce at any point within the declared engine-\\noperating envelope.  The following are acceptab le design con cepts :  \\n \\n         (1)  Engine Self-C ontained E lectrical Power System . \\n \\n              (a)  This type of system  is an  integral part of the engine  design and is both functionally \\nand physically isolated from  the ai rcraft electrical power system. \\n \\n              (b)  This type of  electrical power system  is considered part of the EEC system; its \\npredicted failure event rate should be include d in the EECSA of chapter 5 of this AC. \\nPar 4-1  Page 13 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n              (c)  Back-up electrical power is  not necessarily required w ith this type of system .  \\nHowever, if the applican t elects to us e aircra ft power as a back-up source of power, then the \\napplicant sh ould provid e detailed electrical sy stem interface requirem ents in the installation \\ninstructions and dem onstrate that abnorm al beha vior of the aircraft source cannot upset the EEC \\nsystem .  The predic ted failure event r ate of this back-up power system  does not have to be \\nincluded in the EECSA of chapter 5 of this AC. \\n \\n              (d)  Power from an engine-mounted alternator or generator that is routed directly to the \\naircraft m ain power bus and then in turn used to power the E EC system  is considered part of that \\naircraft bus and not a self-contai ned engine power source.  H owever, EEC system  power from  a \\ndedicated winding on an alternator with dual wind ings is considered a self-contained engine \\npower source, even if the alternate winding is us ed to provide power fo r aircraft sys tems.  \\n \\n         (2)  Aircraft-Supplied Power System (s) for EEC Syste m Electrical P ower. \\n \\n              (a)  Aircraft-supplied power is a ny electrical power so urce th at is an integral part of the \\naircraft electrical sys tem and w hose prim ary function is to power aircraft system s (for exam ple, \\nan electrical bus). \\n \\n              (b)  A f ailure of  a single airc raft bus on a n aircraft equipped with multiple air craft buses \\nis not cons idered a loss o f aircraft po wer if the bu ses are independent and isolated fro m each \\nother and if each of the buses power the EEC system  separately.  Theref ore, a backu p source \\ncould be an alternate aircraft bus, su ch as an es sential bus, that is indepe ndent and isolated from  \\nthe bus serving as the prim ary power source.  An essential bus is an isolated bus that services \\nonly electrical loads required for continued safe operation.  \\n \\n              (c)  When the EEC system  design relies on an aircraf t electrical p ower system  for \\nprim ary power, backup power, or both, the appli cant should provide detaile d electrical system  \\ninterface req uirements in  the installation instructions. \\n \\n              (d)  For EEC system s that rely on aircraf t electrical power system s for prim ary power or \\nbackup power, a m aximum  allowable failure event ra te should be derived for that system  such \\nthat the to tal EEC system f ailure ev ent ra te, in cluding the aircraft power source, rem ains within \\nthe EECSA criteria for full-up and d egraded sys tems of chapter 5 of this AC.  This maxim um \\nallowable failure event rate requirement for the aircraft electrical pow er system (s) should be \\ndefined in th e instruction s for insta llation in chapter 3 of this AC.    \\n \\n              (e)  If aircraft-supplied power, su ch as th e aircraft bu s and battery  system , is used as the \\nprim ary power source, then the EE C system  should have a backup power source that is isolated \\nfrom  the prim ary source.  This backup power source can be integral to the engine EE C system  or \\nprovided by the airplane. \\n \\nPage 14  Par 4-3 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n                   1.  Integral EEC Syste m or Engine E lectrical Backup Power.  Generators or battery \\nsystem s certified with the engine should be physically and functionally separate from  the \\nprim ary EEC power system . \\n \\n                       (aa)  The engine  instructions f or installation should specify in stallation and \\ninterface req uirements for the backup  system . \\n \\n                       (bb)  The applican t should provide instructions fo r continued airworthiness (ICA) \\nand provisions for system m onitoring, to ensure that the back up system  is capable of powering \\nthe EEC system  for continued safe flight.  Fo r exam ple, a battery system  should incorporate \\nprovisions for charge level m onitoring and the ICA should include m aintenance procedures to \\nensure th at the charge level is ad equate to power the EEC system .  \\n \\n                   2.  Airplane System  Electrical Backu p Powe r, such as Altern ate Buses, E ssential \\nBuses, or Battery System s.  The engine instruct ions for installation shou ld specif y the f ollowing: \\n  \\n                       (aa)  A requirem ent that the backup system  is an essential system  physically and \\nfunctionally separate from th e prim ary EEC power system ; \\n \\n                       (bb)  The interface and reliability requirem ents for the airplane system  to m eet \\noverall EEC system  objectives; \\n \\n                       (cc)  System  charge level or power requi rements and health monitoring \\nrequirem ents to ensure that power or charge level is available. \\n \\n                       (dd)  For battery sy stem s, a requirem ent to isolate the backup battery system  from  \\nthe engine starting battery system . \\n \\n         (3)  Mechanical Alternate Control M ode.  A backup electrical power  source is not required \\nfor hybrid system s that incorporate a full m echani cal alternate control m ode.  For these system s, \\nthe applicant should substantiate that the tran sition from  the electronic-powered m ode to the \\nmechanical control m ode can be perfor med wit hout the aircraft-supplied power and without the \\noccurrence of an LOPC. \\n \\n         (4)  New and Novel Design Concep ts.  Technological advan ces in electrical power-\\ngenerating com ponents and in the associated  system s may allow for new and novel design \\nconcepts to m eet the requirem ents of §33.28(b) .  The following are exam ples of possible EEC \\nelectrical po wer system  concepts :  \\n \\n              (a)  Use of an engine alternator , or alternators, to provide power to both the airplane bus \\nsystem  and the engine E EC system .  This woul d require substantiation of the ability of the \\nalternator to continue to supply the E EC system  power in the event of an  airplane bus failure. \\n \\nPar 4-3  Page 15 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n              (b)  Use of an existing airpla ne backup essential battery sy stem  to also provide backup \\npower for the EEC system.  This would requir e a re-ev aluation of the elec trical load \\nrequirem ents and the consequent battery enduran ce.  The battery system  would have to be \\nessential and could not be the sa me battery used to start the e ngine.  In addition, the battery \\nsystem  woul d need to be isolated and inde pendent from  the airplane bus system (s).  \\n \\n         (5)  Non-Critical Engine Control F unctions.  Som e non-critical  engine control functions, \\nsuch as engine starting, that have tradition ally relied ex clusively upon ai rcraft electrical power \\nmay not have to m eet the requirem ents of §33.28(b). \\n \\n     c.  Failure of Aircraft-Supplied Data.  The applicant should provide an analysis, based on \\ncomponent, system , or engine tes ting, as required, that evaluates the im pact of the failure of \\naircraft data on the engine’s perform ance and ope rability throughout the flight envelope.  This \\nanalys is sho uld addres s all a llowa ble engine control and aircraft di spatch configurations in which \\nfailure of aircraft data in that dispatch c onfiguration would impact engine control system \\nresponse.  F ailure of aircraft data  includes airplane system  failure events that either prevent data \\nfrom  being transm itted o r resu lt in th e transm ission of incorrect data.  Th is analysis s hould \\nconsider the following:     \\n \\n         (1)  The analysis should evaluate the engine control responses to aircraft data inputs and \\nshould include an evaluation of the effect of fa ulty and corrupted aircraft-supplied data on the \\nengine control system . \\n \\n         (2)  For EEC system s in which the th rottle or power lever comm and system  is not included \\nin the EEC system  design, thrust and power comm and signals sent from  aircraft should not be \\nincluded in this analysis.  If the aircraft thrust  or power comm and system is configured to m ove \\nthe engine thrust or pow er levers or transm it an electronic sig nal to co mmand a thrust or power \\nchange, the engine control system  merely respon ds to the command and changes engine thrust or \\npower as appropriate.  T he engi ne control system  design should  not a ttempt to dif ferentiate \\nbetween correct or erroneous throttle or power lever comm ands.  Evaluation of this type of \\nsystem  is perform ed under the aircraf t powerplan t insta llation certif ication.  However, for EEC \\nsystem s in which the p ower leve r command is  included in the EEC system  design to be \\ncertificated under part 33, the analysis should include the thrust and power command signals. \\n \\n         (3)  The design of EEC systems inte nded for use on multi-engine airplanes should include \\nan evaluation of the potential fo r common mode faults affecting the operation of m ore than one \\nengine.  The instruction m anual should identify data transfers a nd exchanges between engines, \\nand between the airplane and engines, that could produce common mode faults.  The following \\nare exam ples of potential comm on mode fau lts that the analys is should address: \\n \\n              (a)  A single er roneous data s ource trans mitted f rom the aircr aft to m ultiple e ngines and \\ntheir associated EEC system s (for exam ple, air data sour ces, or auto throttle system s). \\n \\n              (b)  Control system  operating faults spread through data links between engines (for \\nexam ple, m aintenance recording, common bus, cross-talk, or auto matic power reserve system ). \\n \\nPage 16  Par 4-3 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (c)  Loss or interruption of aircra ft data or electrical power used by the engine control, \\nwhen that lo ss or in terruption is cau sed by the failure of another engine. \\n \\n         (4)  The applicant should include an evaluation of the EEC system  fault accommodation \\nlogic for coverage of aircraft-supplied data failure s.  Testing or analysis should be conducted on \\nthe fault accommodated contro l mode to es tablish that the engine ope rating characteristics \\ncomply with all operability requ irements of pa rt 33.  Precautio ns for addressing common effects \\nmay be incorporated in the aircraft s ystem  architecture or in the EEC system  itself.  The \\nfollowing are exam ples of po ssible accommodation m eans: \\n \\n              (a)  Alternate control m odes that are independent fr om aircraft-supplied data. \\n \\n              (b)  Dual sources of aircraft-s upplied sensor data with loca l engine sensors provided as \\nvoters and alternate data sources. \\n \\n              (c)  Use of synthesized engine param eters as voter s.  When synthesized param eters are \\nused for control or voting purposes, the analysis should consider the im pact of tem perature and \\nother environm ental effects on those sensors whose da ta is us ed in the syn thesis.  The analysis \\nshould also assess the variab ility of  any data or in formation necessary  to relate the data from  the \\nsensors used for the synthesized param eters. \\n \\nPar 4-3  Page 17 (and 18) \\n \\n \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\nCHAPTER 5.  SECTI ON 33.28(c) \\n \\n5-1.  Rule Text.  Section 33.28(c) provides that each EEC system  must:  “Be designed and \\nconstructed so that no single fa ilure or m alfunction, or probabl e com bination of failures of \\nelectrical or electroni c com ponents of the control system , results in an unsafe condition.”  \\n \\n5-2.  Intent of Rule.  Section 33.28(c) addresses the uni que, random  nature of EEC system  \\nfailures as com pared to the progressive, wear-out nature of mechanical co ntrol sy stem  failures.  \\nThese rando m failures can be accom modated by de signing redundancy an d reliability into th e \\nsystem .  A r eliability an d safety analysis can substantiate tha t the system  design m eets this \\nintended purpose.  Two key term s that are used when evaluating sys tem safety are “s ingle-fault \\ntolerant” and “uns afe co ndition. ”   \\n \\n     a.  Single-Fault Tolerant.  To m eet the intent of 33.28(c), th e engine control system  should be \\nessentially single fault tolerant of  electrical and electr onic component failures  that can cause an \\nunsafe condition.   \\n \\n         (1)  Achieving com plete single fault to leran ce could req uire a trip licate design approach, or \\na design approach with 100% fault detection.  The FAA has determ ined that it m ay be \\nappropriate for the applicant to om it som e coverage because d etection or accommodation of \\ncertain electrical or elec tronic faults m ay not be practical.  In these cases,  single, sim ple electrical \\nor electronic com ponents or circuits can be us ed in a reliable m anner;  requiring redundancy in \\nsome situations m ay add unnecessary com plexity.  \\n \\n         (2)  E EC system s that are equipped with dual, redundant channels  or with backup system s \\nthat do not provide com plete coverage of fa ults have been approved by the FAA and have \\ndemonstrated excellent in-serv ice safety and re liability.  However, these F AA approvals were \\nbased upon a detailed review of each of these uncovered faults. \\n \\n     b.  Unsafe Condition.  Engine power loss events are not typically considered unsafe \\nconditions when evaluating airpla ne safety.  However, if the frequency of these events is \\nexcessive relative to the safe ty objectives of the intended ap plication, then they can be \\nconsidered unsafe conditions.  Consequently, en gine power losses and shutdowns are included in \\nthe followin g failure con ditions and c ategor ies that are considered  unsafe conditions for \\nreciprocating engines:  \\n \\n         (1)  Destructive events (DE). \\n \\n         (2)  Excessive num ber of LOPC events. \\n \\n         (3)  Excessive num ber of MPL events. \\n \\nPar 5-1  Page 19 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n5-3.  Compliance . \\n \\n     a.  Section 33.28(c) refers only to electr ical and electronic com pone nts; it does not address \\nmechanical control system com pone nts.  The rule  also does not specifica lly address operations \\nwhen faults are present in the EEC system .  However, service experience with EEC system s \\nindica tes tha t to be e conomically v iable, EEC  system  equipped engines must be per mitted to \\noperate f or lim ited tim e periods with  faults pres ent in th e system  (that is, perm itted to operate in \\na degraded state).  In additi on, a thorough system safety analys is should include all of the \\ncomponents of the control system , including the mechanical components.  To address these \\nissues as well as m eet the intent of the rule , the F AA has developed a method, but not the only \\nmethod, for dem onstrating com pliance that allows fo r operation with certain faults (that is, in a \\ndegraded state) and that a ddresses the m echanical com ponents of the control system .  \\n \\n     b.  This m ethod consists of an engine c ontrol system  safety analys is with both quantitative \\nand qualitative elem ents.  The quantitative elem ent com pares the predicted  num ber of failu re \\nevents of the electrical or elec tronic com ponents with established criteria that represents unsafe \\nconditions.  Both full-up and degr aded configurations are evalua ted, but those degraded system  \\nconfiguratio ns that are f ound acceptable are li mited to 20 ho urs of operation.  Mechanical \\ncomponent reliability is evaluated through th e test and analyses required by §§33.19, 33.49, and \\n33.53.  The qualitative elem ents provide an evalua tion of the entire engine control system .   \\n \\n5-4.  Guidan ce.  Instead of addressing all form s and levels of safety analyses, the FA A has \\ndeveloped a m ethod, but not the on ly method, for dem onstrating com pliance that m eets the intent \\nof §33.28(c) and ensures an accep table lev el of safe ty.  The applican t may use a different m ethod \\nof showing com pliance; alternat ive m ethods should be reviewed and accepted by the FAA as \\nearly as possible in the project.  The appli cant can subm it an EECSA to comply with §33.28.  \\nThe m ethod of showing com pliance described in this chapter allows fo r FAA approval of tim e-\\nlimited flight operations with cer tain EEC system faults.  A tim e limit of 20 hours was derived \\nfrom  the unsafe conditio n criteria es tablish ed for a degraded EEC system to ensure an  acceptable \\nreliability level is m aintained  during this type of o peration.  See appendix 1  for a lis t of \\ncompliance docum ents that m ay be subm itted f or this se ction.     \\n \\n     a.  EECSA General.  The EECSA includes a quantitative el ement that is intend ed to  evaluate \\nthe pred icted reliability of  the elec trical or  electronic com ponents of  the EEC system and \\ncompare it to the system safety criteria incl uded in this AC.  The EECSA also includes a \\nqualitative elem ent that provide s an evaluation o f certain asp ects of the control system.  \\n \\n         (1)  The EECSA quantitative analysis will d etermine the  instan taneo us failure ev ent ra tes in \\nboth the full-up system  and degraded system .  These even t rates are then com pared to the unsafe \\ncondition criteria for both the full-up and degrad ed system s.  The quantitative analysis should \\nconsist of the following analyses: \\n \\n              (a)  Nu merical fault tree analysis (FTA); \\n \\n              (b)  Failure m odes and effects analysis (F MEA); and \\nPage 20  Par 5-3 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (c)  Markov or sim ilar type of  analysis to evaluate the EEC system in a degraded \\ncondition.   \\n \\n         (2)  The EECSA qualitative analysis co nsists of design appraisals of certain asp ects of the \\nEEC system.  Paragraph 5-3e of this AC provides a detailed over view of these analyses.  The \\nqualitative analyses should include the following reports: \\n \\n              (a)  Alte rnate co ntrol m ode(s ) characteris tics; \\n \\n              (b)  Control m ode transition; \\n \\n              (c)  EEC system output data content; \\n \\n              (d)  Existing subsystem s; \\n \\n              (e)  Local events analysis; \\n \\n              (f)  Comm ercial, autom otive, or industrial grade elec tronic parts analysis; and \\n \\n              (g)  Programm ed logic device usage. \\n \\n     b.  EECSA Assumptions .  The EECSA shoul d explain any assum ptions m ade regarding \\nairplane installation a nd operating conditions.  These assum ptions should be consistent with \\ncorresponding data contained in  the ICAs and the instructio ns for installation.  These \\nassum ptions could include, but are not lim ited to, the following: \\n \\n         (1)  Maintenance actions and associated intervals; \\n \\n         (2)  Airplane system s or equipm ent response; \\n \\n         (3)   P owerplant installation design and environm ent; and \\n \\n         (4)  Latent failure exposure period. \\n \\n     c.  EECSA Quantitative Analysis.  The quantitative analysis is intended to supplem ent, but \\nnot rep lace, qualitative m ethods based on engineer ing and op erational jud gement and experience.  \\nIn general, the depth and  scope of an acceptable s afety analys is depends o n the com plexity and \\ncriticality of the functions perform ed by the system  and can vary considerably for different types \\nof system s.  Because th is analys is is lim ited to  reciprocating engine el ectronic control system s, \\nthe cr iteria provided in th is AC  can be m ore specific.  The quantitative analysis should \\nencom pass all elem ents of the contro l system , elect rical or electronic and mechanical.  However, \\nthe analysis should only consider failure rates from th e electrical or elec tronic com ponents for \\npredictions of system  reliability.  Th e analys is should not consider the reliability of m echanical \\ncomponents, because it is assum ed that they are n ot subject to  random  failures.  The d urability of \\nthe m echanical com ponents should be evalua ted during the certifi cation block testing. \\nPar 5-4  Page 21 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n         (1)  E ECSA Sa fety Criteria.  This AC provides safety criteria, expr essed in ter ms of events \\nper m illion hours, that h as been found acceptable for EEC system s installed on recip rocating \\nengines.   \\n \\n              (a)  The safety criteria is pr ovided for each of the two m ajor control subsystem s (fuel \\nand ignition ), and also f or any other subsystem .  This is in tended to acco mmodate varying \\ndegrees of system  functionality by in creas ing the allowable f ailure event rates as subsystem s or \\nfunctions ar e added to the tota l system definition.  However, once the to tal num ber of  \\nsubsystem s is defined and the associated m aximum failure ev ent rates are calcu lated, these \\nfailure rate s are a lloca ted across the total sy stem  and not to the i ndividual subsystem s.  \\n \\n              (b)  Criteria is also provided for both full-up and de graded configurati ons.  Criteria other \\nthan that presented in this AC m ay be appropria te if data is a vailab le that substantia tes the \\nalternative r eliability ob jectiv e. \\n \\n              (c)  The FAA consulted with industry representatives and analyzed available service \\ndata to estab lish th e reciprocat ing engine control system  failure  event rates.  This included a \\nreview of the FAA service difficulty reports (S DR) databas e, the Nation al Transpor tation Saf ety \\nBoard (NTSB)/FAA accident database, and the Ai rplane Op erato rs and Pilots Association \\n(AOPA) accident data.  SDR even ts relating to fuel system  or ignition sy stem  failures were \\ntabulated and corrected f or known underreporting of events, and assum ptions were m ade \\nregard ing th e event da ta to estim ate the actua l rate.  This reciprocating en gine in-service data was \\nthen review ed with reciprocati ng engine industry repr esentatives and compar ed to the turbine \\nrequirem ent of one Loss of Thrust Control (LOT C) event per 100,000 hours.  After an evaluation \\nof the respec tive c riticality of  these two types of engines in their typica l installations, the f ailure \\nevent rates of tables 5-1 and 5-2 were found to be consistent with FAA safety objectives for \\nreciprocating engines. \\n \\n         (2)  Full-Up System Analysis Methods  and Criteria.  This anal ysis should be used to \\nconfirm  that the full-up s ystem  meets the system  safety criteria specif ied in table 5 -1.  The \\napplicant should perform both a num erical FTA and an FMEA.  An FMEA is a structured, \\ninductive, b ottom-up analysis u sed to evaluate th e effects of each possib le failure of the contro l \\nsystem  on engine operation.  An FTA is a stru ctured, deductive, top-down analysis used to \\nidentify the conditions, failu res, and events that would cause each defined failure ev ent.  An FTA \\nis a graphic m ethod of identif ying the logical relationship be tween each particular failure \\ncondition and the prim ary elem ent or com ponent fa ilures, other events, or com binations of both \\nthat can cause the failure condition.   \\n \\n              (a)  Mechanical com ponents should be in cluded in th e structure o f each of these \\nanalyses, but only to evaluate  the interrelationships am ong th e EEC system com pone nts.  \\nHowever, reliability va lues should not be assigned to the m echanical components, and they \\nshould not be included in the cum ulative event rate for the system . \\n \\nPage 22  Par 5-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (b)  Table 5-1 provides safety criteria for the full-up s ystem .  Each of these sy stem  \\nelem ents is additive; “o ther” app lies to each subsystem  in addition to the f uel and ign ition \\nsystem s.  For exam ple, an EEC system com prised of fuel, ignition, and wastegate control \\nfunctions sh ould m eet a total system  reliabi lity of  15+15+15= 45 LOPC events per m illion hours \\n(and 450 M PL events p er million h ours).  This criter ia is th en applied to the entire system  and \\nnot allocated to each of the s ubsystem s.  Note that a m aximum of 45 LOPC and 450 MPL events \\nper m illion hours are allowed, regard less of the num ber of subsyste ms.  For exam ple, if the EEC \\nsystem  inclu des more than three sub system s, the sum  of the LOPC rates f or the tota l system  \\nshould not exceed 45 L OPC or 450 MPL events pe r million hours for all of  the electrical and \\nelectronic elem ents.    \\n \\n              (c)  The event rates in table 5- 1 should be applied to the hi ghest appropriate system  or \\nsubsystem  level and not, for exam ple, to individual com ponents of the sam e syste m. \\n \\n         (3)  Degraded System  Analysis Met hods and Criteria.  This an alysis should be used to \\nconfirm  that the system  meets the system  safety cr iteria state d in tab le 5-2 with an ex isting f ault \\nor faults in the system , when tim e lim ited operations with that fault or faults is desired.  If the \\nexisting fault or faults does not a ffect engine operability and the crit eria of table 5 -2 are m et, then \\nTime-Limited Operations (TLO) m ay be approved  for these fault conditions.  The analysis \\ndeterm ines the instantaneous failure rate with one or m ore failures in the system .  A Markov \\nanalysis, or channel failure analysis  for sim ple system s, may be used. \\n \\n     d.  TLO Implementation Requirem ents.  FAA acceptance of the EECSA is based upon \\nincorporating provisions in the EEC system  design for the following:   \\n \\n         (1)  All EEC system faults should be grouped into one of the following three operating \\nlimitation ca tegor ies: \\n \\n              (a)  No Take-Off (NTO).  Take-o ff is not acceptable f or total sys tem faults that result in \\ncalcu lated event rates th at exceed  the degraded system  limits or when the system  does not have \\nsufficient resources to o perate the en gine prope rly.  These system  faults are defined as NTO \\nfaults. \\n \\n              (b)  TLO.  Twe nty hours of ope ration with total system faults is acceptab le when the \\ncalcu lated e vent ra tes are grea ter tha n the f ull-up  limits but le ss than th e degraded sys tem limits.  \\nThese system faults are defined as T LO faults .  In addition, the total system  LOPC and MPL \\nrates should not be greater than 450 and 4500 events  per m illion flight hours, respectively, for \\nthe system  to considered  acceptable f or TLO operations. \\n \\n              (c)  Unlim ited Operation (U LO).   Unlimited ope ration is acc eptable when the  calcu lated \\nevent rates are les s than the full-up sy stem  anal ysis lim its (this m ay apply to degraded system  \\nwith cer tain m inor f aults). \\n \\n              (d)  The system  limits are ad ditive (from table s 5-1 an d 5-2) f or all subsystem s included \\nin the applicant’s EEC system  design. \\nPar 5-4  Page 23 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n         (2)  The EEC system design should in clude provisions for separate  cockpit indications for \\nTLO faults and NTO faults, such as: \\n \\n              (a)  I ndicator lights, codes, etc.; and \\n \\n              (b)  Confir mation of  indicator function duri ng the pre-flight check. \\n \\n         (3)  Engine airworthiness lim itations  and operating lim itations for T LO faults, NTO faults, \\nand ULO fa ults should be specified in  the following certification docum ents:   \\n \\n              (a)  Airworthiness Lim itatio ns Section (ALS) of the In structions for Continued \\nAirworthine ss (ICA) is sued for the t ype certificate (TC) or S TC; and  \\n \\n              (b)  TCDS and STC lim itations; and \\n \\n              (c)  Instructions for installation. \\n \\n         (4)  The lim itations should then be  published in the airplane m aintenance m anual and \\nestab lished as powerpla nt limitation s in the Airp lane Flight Manual (AF M) or Pilot Operating \\nHandbook (POH). \\n \\n         (5)  Inf ormation regarding m aintenan ce actions associated with EEC system  faults should \\nbe included in the troubleshooting procedur es of the Engine Maintenance Manual. \\n \\n \\nTABLE 5-1  \\nFull-Up Sys tem Safety Crite ria \\nElectrical or Electronic Com ponents \\n(Events per Million Hours) \\n \\nSubsystem Maximum Total \\nSystem \\nMaximum \\n \\nFailure \\nCondition Ignition Fuel Other System  \\nDestructive \\nEvent <0.001 <0.001<0.001 <0.003 \\nLOPC 15 15 15 45 \\nMPL 150 150 150 450 \\nNo Effect - - - - \\n \\n \\nPage 24  Par 5-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n \\nTABLE 5-2  \\nDegraded System  Safet y Criteria \\nElectrical or Electronic Com ponents \\n(Events per Million Hours) \\n \\nSubsystem Maximum Total \\nSystem \\nMaximum \\n \\nFailure \\nCondition Ignition Fuel Other System  \\nDestructive \\nEvent <0.001 <0.001<0.001 <0.001 \\nLOPC 150 150 150 450 \\nMPL 1500 1500 1500 4500 \\nNo Effect - - - - \\n \\n \\n \\n     e.  EECSA Qualitative Analyses .  These analy ses com plement the quantitative an alyses and \\nsubstantiate that the applican t has evaluated all aspects of the EEC system design.  These \\nanalyses should include the m echanical com pone nts as well as the electrical and electronic \\ncomponents. \\n \\n         (1)  Alternate Control Mode A nalysis .  Alternate or backup control m odes or system s are \\nusually necessary to m eet the essentially si ngle f ault tolerant requirem ent of §33.28(c).  \\nHowever, unlike engines for transport category aircraft, the backup m odes for reciprocating \\nengines m ay have lim ited control authority. \\n \\n              (a)  If the alternate control m ode does not affect engine opera bility, and if  the p redicted \\nevent rate of  the control mode does not exceed  the criteria of table 5 -2, then 20 hours of \\noperation is perm itted in this m ode. \\n \\n              (b)  The acceptability of these alternate system s should be based on the follo wing \\nfactors: \\n \\n                   1.  Effect on engine operability; and   \\n \\n                   2.  Characteristics of the trans ition to  the altern ate contro l mode. \\n \\nPar 5-4  Page 25 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n              (c)  Factors relating to engine operability that s hould be considered in the design and \\nevaluation of any alternate ope rating mode(s) should include , but are not lim ited to, the \\nfollowing: \\n \\n                   1.  Maxim um power level achievable in the alternate operating m ode; \\n \\n                   2.  Engine control range in the a lternate ope rating mode; \\n \\n                   3.  Altitud e restart cap ability ; \\n \\n                   4.  Dor mant failures of the alternate operating m ode, and docum entation of any \\nautom atic or  manual che cks to ensu re the ava ilability of  the mode; and \\n \\n                   5.  Throttle motion restriction or any other envelope restrictions. \\n \\n         (2)  Control Mode Transition A nalysis.  Th e EECSA should evalu ate system s that use \\nalternate control m odes as backup system s, including  fail-fixed or fail-to-m anual control \\nsystem s, to determ ine acceptab ility of the m ode transfer m echanism .    \\n \\n              (a)  A m anually activ ated sw itch to transition to the alternat e mode m ay be acceptab le if \\nthe instruction m anual docum ents this em ergency procedure and it is eval uated in the EECSA.  \\n \\n              (b)  In som e turbine applica tions th e FAA has accepted a “fail-fixed” fuel flow followed \\nby a m anually activated switch to the  alternate mode.   If this type  of alternate control mode is \\nincorporated in a reciprocating engine, the applicant should m ake provisions for indication of the \\n“fail-fixed” condition to  the flight crew.  \\n \\n              (c)  The alternate mode m ay be im plemented using hydrom echanical, \\nelectrical/electron ic, manual m eans, or any com bination of these m eans.  The engine instruction \\nmanual should state the power change associated with an autom atic tran sfer to the alternate \\nmode.   \\n \\n              (d)  Power changes during auto matic transfer to backup s hould be lim ited to less than \\n15%.  Power changes g reater than 1 5% may be accepted if they result from  a crew-s elected \\ntransfer.   \\n \\n              (e)  Acceptable transition be tween all con trol m odes should be demonstrated to the \\ngreatest extent possible.  Deve lopm ent flight-testing should be used for further evaluation, if \\navailable.  If pilot action is re quired in the f ault detection and transfer of control, the engine \\ninstruction m anual should declare the faults involved in such a situation and the aircraft \\ncertification program  should ev aluate the condition(s).   \\n \\nPage 26  Par 5-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (f)  For transfers that occu r automatically , the f ollowing f actors should be considered: \\n \\n                   1.  The frequency of occurrence of tran sfers to an y alte rnate control m ode.  \\nCom puted frequency of transfer  to any alternate c ontrol m ode should be supported with data \\nfrom  endurance or reliability tes ting, in-service experience on sim ilar equipm ent, or other data \\nacceptable to the FAA. \\n \\n                   2.  Faults th at would res ult in tran sfer to any alternate m ode, and the capab ility of \\ndetec ting th ese faults. \\n \\n                   3.  Self-test coverage and di agnostics.  Sufficient self-tes t coverage and diagnostics \\nshould be provided to allow detectio n of erro r conditions critical to system perfor mance. \\n \\n                   4.  Tim e delays in the transfer of cont rol.  The engine installation m anual should \\nspecif y time delays in th e transf er of control.  In som e cases, the certification engineer m ay not \\nbe able to determ ine if the m ode transition p rovides a safe and  acceptable s ystem  in accordance \\nwith part 33 based solely on analyt ical or sim ulation data.  An engi ne test or fli ght test program  \\ncould be used to provide additiona l data.  In any case, such cont rol transition delays m ay or may \\nnot be certifiable at the aircra ft level depending on the installa tion.  The aircraft certification \\nprogram  should fully evaluate any control m ode transition.  \\n \\n                   5.  Availability of the alternate m ode.  If the alternate m ode is not exercised during \\nnorm al mode operation, an inspectio n interval to uncover latent fa ilures in the alternate m ode \\ncomponents, or a procedure for ex ercising the alternate m ode, should be specified to ensure that \\nthe alternate m ode is functional and available.  Any inspection interval or procedure requires \\nFAA approval.  This should be included in the O perating Instructions and in the Engine \\nMaintenance Manual. \\n \\n                   6.  Provisions for signal(s) to indicate a m ode transition. \\n \\n              (g)  Pilot workload and perf ormance during transition to or  operation in an alternate \\ncontrol m ode m ay need evaluati on at the aircraft level.  Th e applicant sh ould rev iew the \\napplic able a ircraf t certification requirem ents and coordinate with  the installe r, if known, to \\ndeterm ine if any alternate operating modes w ould com ply with the app licable a ircraft \\nrequirem ents.  These issues have been significant for som e program s. \\n \\n         (3)  E EC System  Output Data An alysis.  T he EECSA s hould include inform ation about \\nfaults or f ailures tha t could cause the transm ission  of faulty or drifting engine param eters to the \\naircraft system s, including a prediction of the ra te of occurrence.  The following engine output \\nparam eters are exam ples of param eters th at could be addresse d in this ana lysis: \\n \\n              (a)  Oil pressure; \\n \\n              (b)  Engine speed; \\n \\n              (c)  Manifold pressure;\\nPar 5-4  Page 27 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n              (d)  Cylinder head tem perature; \\n \\n              (e)  Turbine inlet tem perature; \\n \\n              (f)  Exhaust gas tem perature; \\n \\n              (g)  Calculated engine  power param eters (horse power or torque, etc.); \\n \\n              (h)  Com bustion pressure; and \\n \\n              (i)  Engi ne detonation (sometim es called knock). \\n \\n         (4)  Existing Subsystem s Analysis .  The EE CSA should include an evaluation of the \\nfunctional interaction of  any exis ting m echanical contro l syste m elem ents that rem ain on the \\nengine after incorporatio n of the EEC system  or subsystem .  The existing subsystem s analysis \\nshould: \\n \\n              (a)  Address existing m echan ical subsystem s such as carburetors, m agneto ignition, \\nturbo m echanical was tegates, and m echanical fuel injection;   \\n \\n              (b)  Substantiate interface and installation requirements related to these ex isting \\nmechanical system s or com ponents; and \\n \\n              (c)  Address effects on the EEC  system  of failures of these m echanical system s.  \\n \\n         (5)  Local Events Analysis.  W hen the in stallation env ironment is m ore seve re than the \\ndeclared env ironm ental lim its, the EECSA safet y criteria does not apply.  Occurrence of severe \\nenvironm ental events would norm ally be lim ited to  one engine and are referred to as “local \\nevents.”  A local event is not usually consider ed a common mode event;  comm on mode threats, \\nsuch as HIRF, lightning and rain ar e not consid ered local events.  (There m ay be installations in \\nwhich m ultiple engin es are af fected by the sam e local event.  Such insta llations shou ld be \\nconsidered by the engine m anufacturer and will  be reviewed during ai rcraft certification.) \\n \\n              (a)  Exam ples of local events: \\n \\n                   1.  Fluid leaks or m echanical disruptions that could lead to  dam age to control system  \\nelectrical h arnesses, con nectors, o r the contro l unit(s);   \\n \\n                   2.  Fires; and  \\n \\n                   3.  Overheat conditions, for exam ple, t hose resulting from  hot air duct bursts. \\n \\nPage 28  Par 5-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (b)  Consideration of Local Events.   \\n \\n                   1.  Whatever the local event, the resultant  behavior of the E EC system  should not \\ncause a destructive event.   \\n \\n                   2.  If accommodation of a particular local ev ent is based on th e assum ption that there \\nis another function that affords the necessary pr otection, it should be shown that this function is \\nnot rendered inoperative by the sam e local event on  the engine (including destruction of  wires, \\nducts, or power supplies). \\n \\n                   3.  For the purposes of this AC, an overhea t con dition exis ts when the temperature o f \\nthe system  components is greater than the maximum  design operating tem perature for the \\ncomponents, as declared by the engine m anufacturer  in the engine instruct ions for installation.  \\nThe electronic portions of the c ontrol system  should not cause a hazardous engine effect when \\nthe electronic com ponents or units  of the system  are exposed to  a continuous overheat or over-\\ntemperature condition.  Specific de sign features or analysis m ethods should be used to show \\ncompliance with respect to the prevention of hazardous  effects.  W hen this is not possible, due to \\nthe variability or the com plexity of the failure sequence, for exam ple, the FAA m ay require \\ntesting.  \\n \\n              (c)  Fire Testing.  Exposure of  the electrical and electronic parts of the EEC system  to \\nfire should n ot intensify the severity o f the fire condition.  If the EEC system  is located in a fire \\nzone, the applicant should perform  either an analysis of system effects due to fire dam age, or fire \\ntesting.  Fire zones are defined in ap propriate aircraft design regulations. \\n \\n                   1.  The fire requirem ents do not specify th e length  of tim e that elec tronic p arts are \\nrequired to f unction when exposed to fire.  Th e FAA has developed an acceptance criteria for \\nEEC systems that sp ecifies either that the control system  must maintain the ability to s afely shut \\ndown the engine when exposed to fire, or that th ere m ust be an alternate m ethod, such as a fuel \\nshutof f valve, that allow s the pilot to  safely shutdown the engine when there is a fire in the \\nengine com partment.  In addition, the fire analysis or fire test should verify that when exposed to \\nfire for a five m inute period the system does not take unwanted action that could be hazardous to \\nthe aircraft. \\n \\n                   2.  The fuel handling parts of the EEC syst em, including the fuel injector valve parts \\nthat are directly in contact with the fuel, should com ply with the requirements of §33.17, which \\nrequires these parts to be fire re sistant and shielded or located to guard against the ignition of \\nleaking flam mable fluids. \\n \\n                   3.  The FAA has accep ted com puter sim ulations of EEC syst em exposure to fire \\ninstead of fire tests on production hardware as demonstration of compliance with fire \\nrequirem ents.  The computer sim ulation should be  validated by analysis or test, or both, and \\nshould be approved by the FAA.  The  FAA s hould also approve all assumptions upon which \\nconstruction of the com puter sim ulation is based.   \\nPar 5-4  Page 29 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n                   4.  Hardware em ulations for use in fire  tests are also acceptab le.  Hardware \\nemulations should be validated by analysis or test, or both, and should be approved by the FAA. \\n \\n              (d)  Probability of Local Events .  There is no probability a ssociated with the occurrence \\nof local events.  Therefore, all foreseeable local events should be considere d.  It is difficult to \\naddress a ll possible loca l events in th e intend ed aircraft insta llation a t the tim e of engine \\ncertification.  Therefore, s ound engineering judgem ent should be applied to identify the \\nreasonab ly foreseeable local even ts.  \\n \\n                   1.  Each wir e interfacing  with the e lectronic control unit should be tested or analyzed \\nwith respect to wiring faults.  These faults should include open s and shorts to ground, and the \\ntest o r analy sis should sh ow that the f ault re sults in an identified and non-hazardous engine \\nresponse.   \\n \\n                   2.  Aircraft wiring th at interfaces with the EEC system  should be tested o r analy zed \\nfor shorts to aircraft power.  These “hot” shorts shoul d result in an identified and non-hazardous \\neffect.  The engine instructions for installation should state the pot ential effects of wiring faults \\non aircraft interface wiring.  The installer is respo nsible for en suring th at there are no wiring \\nfaults that could affect more than one engine , and if practical, m ore than one EEC system  \\nchannel of a single engine by isolation and separation of the relevant wiring/conductors. \\n \\n                   3.  When the physical separation of c onductors is not practical, the engine \\nmanufacturer and installer should coordinate with each other to ensure th at the po tential for \\ncommon m ode faults between engi ne contro ls is e liminated an d that the po tential f or common \\nmode faults between channels on one engine is minim ized.   \\n \\n              (e)  Fluid Susceptibility.  The applicant should assess th e effects of hydraulic or \\nlubricating leaks im pinging on com ponents of th e EEC system by analysis or test.  These \\nconditions should not result in a hazardous engine effect, nor s hould the fluids be allowed to \\nimpinge on circuitry or printed ci rcuit boards and result  in a potential latent failure condition.  \\nRefer to RTCA Docum ent num ber DO-160D for te st procedures for fluid susceptibility.   \\n \\n         (6)  Guidance for Use of Comm ercial  or Industrial Grade Electronic Parts.  When the \\nengine type design specifies comm ercial or industrial grade elect ronic components, the applicant \\nshould have the following data ava ilable for review, as applicable: \\n \\n              (a)  Reliability data that subs tantiates the failure rate f or each com ponent used in the \\nEEC system reliability analysis and the EEC SA for each com mercial and industrial grade \\nelectrical component sp ecified in the design. \\n \\n              (b)  The EEC system  applican t’s procurem ent, quality assurance, and process control \\nplans for the vendor-supplied commercial and industr ial grade parts.  Th ese plans sho uld ensure \\nthat the par ts will be able to m aintain the re liability level sp ecified in the approved en gine type \\ndesign. \\nPage 30  Par 5-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (c)  Unique databases for si milar com ponents obtain ed from  different v endors, because \\ncommercial and industrial grad e parts m ay not a ll be m anufactured to the sam e accepted industry \\nstandard, su ch as m ilitary com ponent stand ards. \\n \\n              (d)  Substantiation that the proposed extended range of the specif ied com ponents is \\nsuitable for the application, if the declared in stallation tem perature environm ent for the EEC \\nsystem  is greater than that sp ecified by the m anufacturer of th e electronic com ponents specified \\nin the eng ine type des ign.  Addition ally, if  commercial or in dustrial pa rts are used in  an \\nenvironm ent beyond their specified rating and cooli ng provisions are requir ed in the design of \\nthe EEC system , the applicant should specify these provisions in the instruc tions for installation.  \\nFailure m odes of the cooling pr ovisions included in the EEC system  design that cause these \\nlimits to be exceeded sh ould be cons idered in determ ining the  probability of failure. \\n \\n              (e)  Two recently publishe d docum ents provide gu idance on the application of  \\ncommercial or industrial grade com ponents: \\n \\n                   1.  IEC/PAS 62239, Electronic Com ponent Ma nagem ent Plans, edition 1.0, dated \\nApril 2001. \\n \\n                   2.  IEC/PAS 62240, Use of Se miconductor Devices Outside Manufacturers’ \\nSpecified Temperature R anges, edition 1.0, dated April 2001 . \\n \\n         (7)  Programm ed Logic Devices.  Due to the nature and com plexity of system s containing \\ndigital logic, programm ed logic devices should be developed using a structured developm ent \\napproach, eq uivalen t to the hazard as sociated with  failure o r malfunction of the system in which \\nthe device is contained.  Progr amm ed logic dev ices include application s pecific in tegrated \\ncircu its (ASICs) and pro gramm able logic devices (PLDs). \\n \\n              (a)  ASICs are defined as integr ated circuits that are deve loped to im plement a function, \\nincluding, but not lim ited to: gate arrays , standard cell and full custom  components \\nencom passing linear, digital and m ixed m ode technologies.  \\n \\n              (b)  A PLD is defined as any devi ce that is purchased as an el ectronic part and altered to \\nperform  an a pplication specific function.  PLDs  usually require programming by the equipm ent \\nmanufacturer.  PLDs include, but are not lim ited to, the follow ing: \\n \\n                   1.  Programm able array logic (PAL) devices;  \\n \\n                   2.  Programm able logic array (PLA) devices; \\n \\n                   3.  General array logic (GAL) devices;  \\n \\n                   4.  Field programm able gate array (FPGA) devices; and  \\n \\n                   5.  Electrically or erasable progr ammable logic devices (EPL D).   \\nPar 5-4  Page 31 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n              (c)  RTCA Docum ent DO- 254 provides g uidance for the criticality , failure con dition \\ncategories, and design assurance levels associ ated with developm ent of programm ed logic \\ndevices.   \\n \\n              (d)  For off-the-shelf equipm ent or m odified equipm ent, se rvice experience m ay be used \\nto dem onstrate com pliance.  This should be accepta ble if  the worst-ca se failure or m alfunction of \\nthe device for the new installation is not m ore severe  than th at for the o riginal insta llation of  the \\nsame equipm ent on another application.  The ap plicant should also consider significant \\ndifferences related to the environm ental or ope rational ca tegor y of the airc raft in which  the \\norigin al sys tem was installed and cer tified. \\nPage 32  Par 5-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\nCHAPTER 6.  SECTI ON 33.28(d)  \\n \\n6-1.  Rule Text.  Section 33.28(d) provides that each EEC  system  must:  “Have environm ental \\nlimits, inclu ding tr ansie nts caused b y lightn ing strikes, spec ified in the in struc tion m anual.” \\n \\n6-2.  Intent of Rule.  Section 33.28(d) ensures that the environm ental ope rating lim itations of the \\nEEC system are spe cified in the c ertification da ta as installation requirements for the installer.  \\nSection 33.28(d) com plements §33.53, reciprocati ng engine com ponent te st, which requires the \\ncorresponding environm ental testi ng used to establish the envi ronm ental lim itations.  Both \\n§§33.28(d) and 33.53 encom pass electrical environm ental co nditions such as ligh tning, HIRF, \\nEMI, as well as physical environm ental conditions  such as temperature, hum idity, vibration, and \\nwater.  The applic ant sh ould substan tiate the declared electrical envi ronmental lim itations by \\ncomponent and system  tests of the E EC system .  The engine enduran ce test of §33.49 provides \\nsome substantiation of the physical environm ental conditions.  However, for those physical \\nenvironm ental and installation conditions not simulated during the engine endurance test, the \\napplicant should  conduct tests or analyses to establish th at both the individual com ponents and \\nthe system  will operate properly ov er the full ran ge of these conditions.    \\n \\n6-3.  Guidance.  Although the FAA does not specify the test lim its, the conditions declared by \\nthe applicant should  represent environm ents that would be en countered in the engine installation.  \\nDue to the obvious overlap of §§33.28(d) and 33.53, this AC provides guidance for the tests used \\nto establish the environm ental lim itations.  Th is guidance provides a m ethod, but not the only \\nmethod, for dem onstrating com pliance with §33.28(d) .  See appendix 1 for a list of compliance \\ndocum ents that m ay be subm itted f or this se ction.  \\n \\n6-4.  Electrical Environmental Li mitations .  Ele ctrical envir onmental lim itations in clude \\nlimitations f or the effects of HIRF, lightning, and EMI. \\n \\n     a.  Declared Levels. \\n \\n         (1)  If the installation is known, the engi ne control system should be tested at levels that the \\nengine and aircraft m anufacturers have agreed up on.  W ith this agreem ent, the installation should \\nmeet the aircraft certification requirem ents.  Successful com pletion of the testing to the agreed-\\nupon levels would be accepted for engine type certification.  Th is, however, m ay limit the engine \\nto a specific aircra ft installation.   \\n \\n         (2)  If the aircraft  application is not known or defined at  the tim e of the engine certification, \\nthe engine m anufacturer m ay use the default values defined in this paragraph and use assum ed \\ninsta llation attenu ation ef fects. \\n \\n              (a)  HIRF Default Values.  The FAA has established re comm ende d minimum default \\nlevels for system  laboratory HIRF tests:  \\n \\n                   1.  For frequencies from  10 kHz to 700 MHz,  the m inimum test level should be 100 \\nvolts per m eter av erage.  \\nPar 6-1  Page 33 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n                   2.  For frequencies from  700 MHz to 18 GHz, the m inimum test level should be 200 \\nvolts per m eter av erage.  \\n \\n              (b)  EMI and Lightning Default Values.  AC 20-136 and RTCA Docum ent DO-160 \\nprovide appropriate test values.  \\n \\n     b.  Test Procedures. \\n \\n         (1)  General.  The installed engine controls system , including representative engine-aircraft \\ninterface cables, should be the ba sis for certification testing.  \\n \\n              (a)  EMI.  EMI tests procedures  and test levels should fo llow the g uidelines of  RTCA \\nDocum ent DO-160,  MIL-STD-461, or  MIL-ST D-462.  However, the applicant should provide \\nthe rationale for conducting a test using the MIL-STD-461 or MIL-STD-462 procedure if that \\ntest procedure differs from the corres ponding RTCA Docum ent DO-160D procedure.  \\n \\n              (b)  HIRF.  The applicant shoul d use th e HIRF test g uidelin es provided in Section 20 of \\nRTCA Docum ent DO-160D, or the equivalent.  However, the test s defined in RTCA Docum ent \\nDO-160D a pply to a component test level, requiri ng the applicant to adapt these test procedures \\nto a system  level HIRF test to m eet the intent of §33.28(d). \\n \\n              (c)  Light ning.  Lightning tests should follow the guidelines provided in AC 20-136 and \\nSection 22 of RTCA Docum ent DO-160D.  Pin in jection tests (PIT) shou ld be conducted on the \\nEEC unit and other system com pone nts as required.  PIT levels should be appropriately selected \\nfrom  the tables of Section 22 of RTCA Docu ment DO-160D.  Environm ental tests that follow \\nthe guidelin es of MIL-STD-810E may be accep ted instead of RTCA Doc ument DO-160 tests if \\nthe MIL-ST D-810E tests are equal to or m ore rigorous than those defined in RTCA Docum ent \\nDO-160D. \\n \\n         (2)  Open Loop Versus Closed Loop Testing. \\n \\n              (a)  HIRF, lightning, and EMI tests should be conducted as system tests on closed loop \\nor open loop laboratory set-ups.  The applicant should provide the closed loop set-up with the \\nnecessary mechanical means to actuate any syst em m echanical com ponents to close the inner \\nactuating loops.  The applicant m ay use a sim plified engine simula tion to close the outer engine \\nloop.  Testing should be conducted w ith the engi ne control system  controlling at the most \\nsensitive operating point, as sele cted by the applicant.  The system  should be exposed to the \\nHIRF, lightning, and EMI environm ental threats while operating at the selected condition.  The \\nHIRF, lightning, and EMI environm ental thre ats m ay have differe nt operating points. \\n \\nPage 34  Par 6-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (b)  If th e applicant conducts tests in open loop set-ups, the following factors should be \\nconsidered:  \\n \\n                   1.  If special EEC system test software is  used, that software should be developed \\nand im plemented by guidelines defined for softwa re leve ls of at leas t Level C in R TCA \\nDocum ent DO-178B, or the equivalent.  In som e cases, the application code should be m odified \\nto include the required test code features. \\n \\n                   2.  The system test set-up should be inst rumented to m onitor both the output drive \\nsignals and the input signals. \\n \\n                   3.  Anom alies observed on inputs or output s should be duplicat ed on the engine \\nsimulation to determ ine if the resulting power or thrust perturbations comp ly with th e pass/f ail \\ncriteria. \\n \\n     c.  Pass/Fail Criteria. \\n \\n         (1)  HIRF and Lightning.  The cont rol system operation should not experience any adverse \\neffects when exposed to the conditions of th e HIRF and lightning tests.  The following are \\nconsidered adverse effects:  \\n \\n              (a)  A greater than +/-10% change of rated power or thrust change from  the norm al \\ncontro l governing cap ability for a p eriod of m ore than one second; \\n \\n              (b)  Com ponent dam age; \\n \\n              (c)  False fault annunciation to  the crew that continues beyond the duration of the HIRF \\nor lightning event and could cause unnecessa ry or inappropriate  crew action; and \\n \\n              (d)  Erroneous operation of engine protection circuits. \\n \\n         (2)  E MI.  RTCA Docum ent DO-160D provides pass criteria for EMI testing. \\n \\n     d.  Component and S oftware Design Changes .  Hardware or soft ware design changes \\nimplemented after initial qualification should be evaluated for their effects on the EMI and HIRF \\nand lightning environm ent.  Appr opriate testing or analysis, or both, should be defined to ensure \\nthat the original basis for certification is m aintained.  The applicant should conduct component \\nlevel testing for these purposes. \\n \\n     e.  Maintenance Requirements.  Section 33.4 and appendix A to part 33 require that the \\napplicant prepare ICA for all engi ne parts to ensure the continue d airwor thiness of  the insta lled \\nsystem s.  AC 33.4-1, “Instructions f or Conti nued Airworthiness,” provides guidance for \\npreparation of ICAs.  These instructions s hould include m aintenance requirem ents for the \\nelectrical environm ent protection features because these features  depend, to som e extent, on the \\nphysical integrity of the design.  The m aintenanc e requirem ents for HIRF protection f eatures to \\nPar 6-4  Page 35 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\nbe considered during certification include period ic inspec tions or tes ts for required structural \\nshielding, wire shields, connect ors, and equipm ent protection com ponents.  The applicant m ust \\nprovide the engineering valida tion and substantiation of these m aintenance requirem ents.  \\nParagraph 7 of  AC 20-136, “Main tenance and Su rveillanc e,” provides ad dition al guid ance f or \\ncontinued airworthiness of syst em lightning protection features. \\n \\n6-5.  Physical Environmental L imitations .  Physical env ironmental lim itations inclu de lim itation s \\nfor the effects of physical environm ental factor s such as tem perature, humidity, vibration, and \\nwater.  The applicant should substantiate all com ponents of  the EEC system , including all \\nelectronic units, sensors, harnesses, hydrom echanical com ponents, electrom echanical \\ncomponents, and any other associated com ponents,  for proper operation over the full range of \\nphysical env ironm ental conditions.   For t hose co mponents th at undergo testing, the \\nenvironm ental lim iting conditions should be sim ulated in a laboratory test fixture.  If possible, \\nthe com plete engine should be tested. \\n \\n     a.  Environm ental test requirem ents ar e specified in RTCA Docum ent DO-160 and listed in \\ntable 6 -1.  Acceptab le test procedu res for each ite m are referenced in the sam e table.  Not all \\ntests are applicable to all com pone nts.  The applicant should provide  rationale for the selection of \\napplicable tests for each com ponent. \\n \\n     b.  Use of the pre-established envir onmental classifications of RTCA Docum ent DO-160 \\nallows certification of compone nts in a consistent m anner, in dependently from  installation \\nconsiderations.  However, the classification sp ecified by the a pplican t sho uld repr esent the \\nenvironm ent of the proposed installation.  \\n \\n     c.  The applicant should prepare an envi ronm ental test plan, summarized in an environm ental \\ntest m atrix, that defines the m ethod to be us ed to qualify the com ponent for each of the \\nenvironm ents.  The applicant should subm it the pl an and test m atrix to the FAA for review and \\napproval b efore tes ting is  initiated.  Generally, the applicant should test only the types of \\nenvironm ents that the component s are expected to encounter.  The m atrix should note other \\nenvironm ents as “not applicable.”  T he com pone nts m ay be qualified by test, sim ilarity, analysis, \\nand com binations of these factors.  F or subs tantiation by sim ilarity, the component should be \\nshown to be sufficiently sim ilar and to operate in an environm ent that is the sam e or less severe \\nthan the p reviously c ertified com ponent. \\n \\n     d.  Before the testing is initiated, all conf ormity requirem ents for the software, hardware, and \\nthe test setu ps should be estab lished and approved by the FAA.  Confor mity should  be \\ndocum ented as part of the Certification Report.  The applicant should re concile any differences \\nbetween the test hardware and the type design ha rdware in th e test plan a nd subm it it f or FAA \\napproval before the start of testing. \\n \\n     e.  The list of applicable requirem ents a nd associated tests or proced ures (or their e quivalen t) \\nin table 6-1 has been accepted for evaluating component airworthiness.  The applicant should \\nobtain FAA approval of these environm ental test p lans bef ore initiating the tests. \\n \\nPage 36  Par 6-4 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\nTABLE 6-1  \\n ENVI RONMENTAL \\nCONDITI ONS ACCEPTABLE TES TS/PROCEDURES \\n1 High Tem perature \\nDemonstration \\n RTCA Docum ent DO-160, section 4  \\nor MIL-ST D-5007D paragraph 4.6.2.2.5  \\n2 Low Te mperature \\nDemonstration \\n RTCA Docum ent DO-160, section 4  \\nor MIL-ST D-5007D paragraph 4.6.2.2.7 \\n3 Room  Tem peratu re \\nDemonstration  RTCA Docum ent DO-160, section 4 \\nor MIL-ST D-5007D paragraph 4.6.2.2.6 \\n4 Contam inated Fluids Reference §§33.35, 33.39 for fuel/oil/air \\nrequirem ents  \\nor MIL-ST D-5007D paragraph 4.6.2.2.6  \\n(fuel test only) \\n5 Vibration RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 8  \\n6 Impact RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 7 \\n7 Sustained A cceleration RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 7  \\nor MIL-ST D-810E, Method 513 \\n8 Sand and Dust RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 12, \\nCategory D  \\nor MIL-ST D-810E \\n9 Fluid Susceptibility RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 11, \\nCategory F \\n10 Salt Spray RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 14, \\nCategory S  \\nor MIL-ST D-810E \\n11 Induction Icing Reference §33.35 \\n12 Fungus RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 13, \\nCategory F \\n13 Temperature and Altitude RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 4 \\n14 Therm al Cycle  RTCA Do cument DO-160, Section 5 \\n15 Explosion Proofness RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 9 \\n16 Hum idity RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 6  \\nor MIL-ST D-810E \\n17 Waterproofness RTCA Docum ent DO-160, Section 10  \\nMIL-STD-810E (RAIN)  \\n18 Power Input RTCA Docum ent DO-160,  \\nSections 16 and 17 \\nor MIL-ST D-704 \\nPar 6-5  Page 37 (and 38) \\n \\n \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\nCHAPTER 7.  SECTI ON 33.28(e) \\n \\n7-1.  Rule Text.  Section 33.28(e) provides that each EEC  system  must:  “Have all associated \\nsoftware des igned and implem ented to preven t erro rs that wo uld resu lt in an unaccep table lo ss of \\npower or thrust, or other unsafe condition, and have the m ethod used to design and implem ent \\nthe software approved by the Adm inistrator.” \\n \\n7-2.  Intent of Rule.  Section 33.28(e) requires that EEC system  softwar e undergo a sufficient \\nlevel of design assurance testing to ensure, with a high level of confidence, that erro rs in the \\nsoftware are prevented, and re quires that the FAA approve the m ethod used to design and \\nimplem ent the sof tware.    \\n \\n7-3.  Guidance.  The following guidance provides a method, but not the only m ethod, for \\ndemonstrating com pliance with §33.28(e).  Comp liance with §33.28(e) shoul d be demonstrated \\nby software design and implem entation in acco rdance with an  approved method, such as RTCA \\nDocum ent DO-178B, in com bination with system  validation testing. \\n \\n     a.  Compliance Elem ents. \\n \\n         (1)  Software Design and Im plem entation Process.  RTCA Docum ent DO-178B, “Software \\nConsiderations in Airborne Sy stem s and Equipment Certificati on,” provides guidelines for the \\nsoftware design and im plem entation process.  Th is proce ss includes the f ollowing ac tivities:  \\n \\n              (a)  Lif e cycle d efinition ; \\n \\n              (b)  Planning; \\n \\n              (c)  Developm ent; \\n \\n              (d)  Software verification; \\n \\n                   1.  Requirem ents-based coverage analysis should be conducted to dem onstrate that \\nthe system  requirem ents alloc ated to  the software have been properly implem ented. \\n \\n                   2.  The software should be verified by open or closed loop bench testing on a system  \\nthat p rovides an electrical si mulation of the engine system . \\n \\n              (e)  Configuration m anagem ent; and \\n \\n              (f )  Quality a ssurance.   \\n \\n         (2)  System  Validation Testing.  Va lidation testing should be conducted to substantiate \\nsuccessful integration of the EEC system  softwa re and the engine cont rol system .  Valida tion \\ntesting should be perform ed on a complete engine , or on a test rig that provides a physical \\nsimulation of the engine control system.  \\nPar 7-1  Page 39 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n     b.  Software Level Requirement.  The level of confidence rega rding error prevention in the \\nsoftware is d irectly rela ted to the s cope of the design assurance activity.  These design assurance \\nscopes have been defined in term s of software leve ls.  These levels have been correlated to EEC \\nsystem  functional criticality.  The FAA has accepted EEC system  software verification to \\nsoftware levels defined in RT CA Docum ent DO-178B as substa ntiation for the error prevention \\nrequirem ent.  The following inform ation is provided for determ ining the software level: \\n \\n         (1)  RTCA Docum ent DO-178B softwa re level C has been determ ined to be the m inimum \\nrequirem ent for the reciprocating engine EEC syst ems to which this AC applies.  Level C would \\nbe accep table for single-engine or twin-eng ine airplanes under 6000 pounds m aximum take-off \\nweight (MT OW) approved under part 23 norm al, utility or acrobatic categor ies, or sim ilar CAR \\n3 approval. \\n \\n         (2)  The guidance provided in this  AC does not apply to r eciprocatin g EEC system s \\ninstalled in airplanes approved under part 23 co mmuter or part 25 transport categories.  \\nTherefore, the m inimum software level for those EEC system s should be determ ined by \\nperform ing an airp lane s ystem -level safety analy sis. \\n \\n         (3)  For reciprocating EEC system s installed in any other aircraft, the applicant should \\nevaluate the failure condition criticality of EEC s ystem  functions to determ ine if Leve l C \\nsoftware would be adequate.  This w ould require coordination with the aircraft designer and the \\ncognizant aircraft ACO during the EEC sy stem  developm ent program .      \\n \\n     c.  Software Partitioning.  Non-cr itical sof tware may be partition ed from the critic al sof tware, \\nallowing the non-critical software  to be designed and im plemented at a lower level than that \\nestab lished f or the c ritical software.   \\n \\n         (1)  The applicant should substan tiate the adequacy of th e partitioning m ethod.  \\n \\n         (2)  The partition should be deve loped to the highest leve l of the components being \\npartition ed.   \\n \\n         (3)  Th e applicant s hould consider if the lo wer levels o f the partitio ned software are \\nappropriate for the anticipated in stallations.  If  the critic ality level requirem ent were higher in \\nsubsequent applications, it would be difficult to raise the softwa re level without repeating the \\nsoftware lif e cycle p rocesses f or the new level. \\n \\n     d.  Software Integrity.  RTCA Docum ent DO-178B provi des guidance for assurance of \\nsoftware used at specified hazard lev els.  As w ith all gu idance to which th is docum ent refers, \\nDO-178B may be m odifi ed or updated due to events or advancem ents in technology.   \\nPage 40  Par 7-3 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\nCHAPTER 8.  INTEG RATION O F ENGINE,  PROPELLER,  \\nAND AIRCRAFT SYS TEMS \\n \\n8-1.  EEC System Integration Certification P lan (SICP) .  There m ust be a clear definition of the \\nrespective certification tasks of the v arious app licants : engine, propeller, and aircraft \\nmanufacturers, with th e associat ed engine, propeller, and aircraft  certification authorities.  This \\nshould be do cumented in an EEC SICP, subm itted by the ap plican t for engine certification.  The \\nplan should be included as an a ppendix to the instructions for in stallation and should include the \\nfollowing: \\n \\n     a.  Distribution of Compliance Tasks.  The tasks for the certification of  the aircraft propulsion \\nsystem  equipped with electronic controls m ay be shared between the engine, propeller, and \\naircraft m anufacturers.  The distribution of these tasks betw een the m anufacturers should be \\nidentified an d agreed on by the appro priate engin e, propeller, and aircraft  authorities.  The EEC \\nSICP should summarize the engine a pplicant’s responsibili ties for these certification tasks.  The \\nplan should list each task related to the EEC system  certification and define those for which the \\nengine applicant is responsible and those for which the aircraft or propeller applicant is \\nresponsible.  The plan should address all an alyses and tests required for E EC system  \\ncertification.  \\n \\n     b.  Interface Definition and Other Data .  The EEC SICP should includ e interface d efinition s \\nand other data for the functional, hardware, and software aspects that have been integrated \\nbetween the engine, propeller, and aircraft systems.  The plan s hould describe integration aspects \\nor provide cross-references to the in struc tions f or installation  for the f ollowing item s:      \\n \\n         (1)  Functional requirem ents; \\n \\n         (2)  Fault accommodation strategies; \\n \\n         (3)  Maintenance strategies; \\n \\n         (4)  Software quality  level (per function if necessary); \\n \\n         (5)  The reliability objectives f or: \\n \\n              (a)  LOPC and MPL events; and \\n \\n              (b)  Transm ission of faulty param eters. \\n \\n         (6)  The environm ental requirem ents, including the degree of protection against lightning \\nor other electrom agnetic effects (f or exam ple, the level of induced  voltages that can be supported \\nat the interfaces); \\n \\n         (7)  En gine, propeller, and ai rcraft interface data a nd ch aracteristics; and \\n \\n         (8)  Aircraft electrical power su pply requirem ents and characteristics (if relevant). \\nPar 8-1  Page 41 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n     c.  Design Change Control.  The EEC SICP s hould describe th e design change control system  \\nestablished to support post-certifi cation activity.  This system  shoul d ensure that changes to any \\ncontro l elem ent tha t is in tegra ted in to the EEC system  are evaluated by all design approval \\nholders of that integrated system .   \\n \\n8-2.  Aircraft Functions Integrated into the Engine Control System . \\n \\n     a.  Integration Activities.  These a ctivities inv olve the inte gration of aircraft and propeller \\ncontrol functions (that is, those that have tradition ally no t been considered engine control \\nfunctions) into the EEC system ’s hardware and software.  Exam ples include: propeller speed \\ngovernors, which govern speed by varying pitch, cowl flap controls, a nd autom atic throttle \\nsystem s. \\n \\n         (1)  The EEC system m ay be configur ed to contain only part of the aircraft sys tem’s \\nfunctions, or it m ay contain all of it.  Turbine engine th rust reverser control system s are an \\nexam ple in which only part of the f unctions are included in the EEC system .  In such cases, the \\naircraft is configured to have  separate switches and logic (tha t is, ind ependent from the EEC \\nsystem ) as part of the thrust re verser control system.  This sepa ration of reverser control system  \\nelem ents and logic p rovides an architectural m eans to lim it the critic ality of  the f unctions \\nprovided by the EEC system .    \\n \\n         (2)  However, in som e cases the EEC system m ay be configured to  incorpor ate virtu ally all \\nof a critical aircraft function.  Examples of this are EEC system s that contain full authority to \\ngovern propeller speed and autom atic throttle system s in turbofan-pow ered aircraft.  T he first of \\nthese is cons idered critical becau se if an engine  fails, the log ic in the engine contro l must be \\nconfigured to feather the propeller on that en gine.  Failure to rapidl y feath er the p ropeller \\nfollowing an engine failure resu lts in excessive drag on the ai rcraft; such a condition can be \\ncritical to th e aircraft.  A utomatic throttle system s are cons idered critical because the system  is \\nrequired to react to an en gine failure during take-off by increasi ng the thru st of the rem aining \\nfunctioning engine(s); the increased thrust on the functioning e ngines is necessary to achieve the \\nrequired aircraft performance.   \\n \\n     b.  Certification Considerations. \\n \\n         (1)  Engine Certification.  The engi ne certification program  should include all hardware \\nand software substantiation requirem ents for th e hardware a nd software  that resid es on the \\nengine, including those that provide  aircraft or propeller functions .  This includes environm ental \\ntesting of all com ponents and software quality as surance of the software that perform s both the \\nengine and aircraft functions. \\n \\n              (a)  The EECSA and other anal yses (aircraft power, fault accommodation, etc.) that the \\nengine applicant should subm it for engine cer tification should address only engine functions \\nperform ed by the EEC system .  The aircraft and propeller functions do not need to be evaluated \\nin the EECSA unless they affect e ngine operation or reliability.   \\n \\nPage 42  Par 8-1 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\n              (b)  The engine applicant should include in the instru ctions f or installation th e \\narchitecture,  failure ev ent rate data, and any other requirem ents for the aircraft or propeller \\nfunctions that reside in the EEC system  components.   This data is then considered part of the \\nengine type design to which the associated aircraft or propell er certification program  must \\nadhere.   \\n \\n         (2)  Aircraft or Propeller Certification. \\n \\n              (a)  The ai rcraft or propeller  certification program s should us e the data in the engine \\ninstructions for installati on for input into the aircraft or propell er safety analysis for evaluation of \\nthe safety and functional as pects of th ose system s. \\n \\n              (b)  The aircraft or prope ller functions perform ed by the EEC system  should be \\nsubstantiated by test and analys is during the airplane or prop eller certification prog ram.  \\n \\n8-3.  Integration of Engine Control Functions into Aircraft S ystem s. \\n \\n     a.  Integration Activities.  The trend toward system s integration m ay lead to aircraft system s \\nperform ing functions that are tr aditionally con sidered pa rt of the engine control.   \\n \\n         (1)  Lim ited authority functions that  are not required by the EEC system  for engine control \\nmay be incorporated into the aircraft or propeller  system s.  This type of function would augm ent \\nthe basic engine control with input s based on certain aircra ft flight conditions.  In these cases, the \\nEEC system would provide all the functions required to safely ope rate the engine in accordance \\nwith part 33.  An exa mple of such a lim ited author ity function is an engine contro l that rece ives a \\ntorque output dem and signal from  the aircraft and responds by changing th e engine’s fuel flow \\nand other variables to m eet that dem and. \\n \\n         (2)  Other designs m ay use aircra ft system s to im plement a significant num ber of \\nthe engine control system functions.  Exam ples of this are the com plex integrated flight \\nand engine c ontrol sy stems for tiltrotor air craft.  These syste ms are integ rated into a ircraft \\navionics units and govern engine speed, rotor sp eed, rotor pitch angle, and rotor tilt angle.  \\n \\n     b.  Certification Considerations. \\n \\n         (1)  Engine Certification.   \\n \\n              (a)  The EECSA and other anal yses (loss of aircraft powe r, fault accommodation, etc.) \\nsubm itted f or engine cer tification sho uld inc lude the engine co ntrol f unctio ns perf ormed by the \\naircraft or propeller system.  The engine applican t should substantiate the adequacy of the event \\nfailure rate s, function arc hitectures, and any other requirem ents used  in these analyses by test and \\nanalysis.  The analyses may be based on actual or assum ed aircra ft or propeller systems design \\ncharacteristics.   \\n \\nPar 8-2  Page 43 \\nAC 33.28-2  8/13/03 \\n              (b)  The engine applicant should include in the instru ctions f or installation th e \\narchitecture,  failure ev ent rate data, and any other requirem ents for the engine functions that \\nreside in th e aircraft or  propeller system  components.   This data is then considered part of the \\nengine type design to which the associated aircraft or propell er certification program  must \\nadhere.   \\n \\n         (2)  Aircraft or Propeller Certification. \\n \\n              (a)  The data sub mitted for the aircraft or propeller certification program  should \\nsubstantiate that the asso ciated  aircraft or propeller system  meets these en gine ins tallation \\nrequirem ents.  \\n \\n              (b)  The aircraft or propell er certification program  shoul d include all hardware and \\nsoftware substantiation requirem ents for the hardware  and software that resi des on the aircraft or \\npropeller, including those that perform engine control functi ons.  This inc ludes env ironmental \\ntesting of all com ponents and software quality as surance of the software that perform s both the \\nengine and airplane functions. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nPage 44  Par 8-3 \\n8/13/03  AC 33.28-2 \\nAppendix 1 \\nAPPENDIX 1.

The physical rotational speed of a rotor \\ncorrected  by normalizing  the rotor module inlet conditions to a standard  condition \\nof air at 59° Fahrenheit (518.67° Rankine). The correction values are determined \\nempirically and are applied by the following formula:  \\n \\nNc = r , where  Tinlet = the rotor module inlet temperature  in degrees Rankine.  \\n \\n Tinlet \\n518.67  \\n• Endurance limit . The maximum stress range that can be repeated indefinitely \\nwithout material fatigue failure or below which fatigue failure never occurs due to cyclic stresses.  The endurance limit  is a function of steady -state stress,  temperature, \\ngeometry, and material properties.  \\n• Flight  envelope . All approved conditions of operation, including  ground and flight \\noperations, and windmilling rotation in flight. \\n• Flutter . In a system having blades or vanes, flutter is a self- excited vibration that \\nusually occurs at one of the blade\\'s natural frequencies and the associated mode shape.  It is independent of any external excitation source, but is dependent on the \\nairstream as an external source of energy and on the structure  aeroelastic properties.  \\n• Physical  rotational speed  (Nr).  The raw uncorrected rotational speed  of a rotor \\nsystem measured in revolutions per minute (rpm). \\n• Resonance. A condition that occurs when  the excitation  frequency  coincides with \\none of the component\\'s natural frequencies (fn) resulting in an increase of the vibratory amplitude. A unique vibratory mode exists for each resonant response.  \\n \\n7 TEST PREPARATION.  \\n \\n7.1 Selection  of Components.  \\nSection  33.83 requires  vibration surveys by engine test for all components subject to \\nmechanically  and aerodynamically induced vibrations, to include at least the engine \\nblades, vanes and nozzles, rotor discs, spacers, and rotor shafts.  Therefore, the \\ncomponents s elected for vibration surveys will normally include:  \\n• The blades and vanes in each stage of the low, intermediate, and high- pressure \\nrotors.  For each stage with identical  blades and vanes,  the survey  needs to cover the \\nblades and vanes that are identified as most critical because of their vibratory characteristics.  \\nFebruary  2, 2023  AC 33.83 -2B \\n4  \\n  \\n• All stages of discs and spacers.  \\n• All main  rotor  shaft  systems (and gears  when  included in such systems).  \\n• Any other component specifically  identified  as critical because of its vibratory \\ncharacteristics.  \\n \\n7.2 Engine  Test and Supporting  Activity.  \\n \\n7.2.1 Policy PS- ANE -33.83-01, referenced in paragraph 5.4 of this AC, clarifies that the \\nrequired engine vibration surveys of § 33.83(a) are intended to be implemented by \\nengine test.  Furthermore, the requirement of § 33.83(a), stating “The engine surveys \\nshall  be based  upon an appropriate  combination  of experience, analysis,  and component \\ntest and shall address, as a minimum, blades, vanes, rotor discs, spacers, and rotor shafts,” is intended to be applied to activities supporting the conduct of the engine vibration  test.  \\n \\n7.2.2 In preparation for certification testing, the applicant should conduct the tests and analyses necessary  to identify  those components and systems that may be subject to \\nmechanically or aerodynamically induced vibratory excitations and determine its vibration characteristics, including the natural frequencies and mode shapes.  In \\naddition, the applicant should determine the steady state (mean) stresses and the relationsh ips between measured and peak vibratory stresses.  \\n \\n7.3 Rig Testing.  \\n \\n7.3.1 Section 33.83 requires running an engine test for the vibration survey (see paragraph \\n7.2.1). However, testing an engine module on a rig may replace the module being tested as part of the engine test, provided certain conditions are met. A rig test, as \\nreferenced here, consists of running an engine module test. A module is either a \\ncomplete compres sor or a complete turbine engine section, which may be single or \\nmulti- stage.  For a multi -stage  module, the rotating  elements are mechanically  joined \\nand rotate at the same speed.  A gearbox may also be tested as a module. \\nNote: A single  stage  or subset  of stages isolated  from a multi -stage  compressor  or \\nturbine does not constitute a module. A gearbox may also qualify as a module. \\n \\n7.3.2 The applicant may propose to run module tests to overcome potential limitations \\nassociated  with running an engine test, such as the amount of instrumentation  or range \\nof inlet conditions. The applicant should demonstrate the following: \\n• The module interfaces  and boundary conditions are representative of the engine.  \\n• The operating  conditions achieved  for that particular  engine module  test are the \\nsame as if the module would have been run in an engine test. \\nFebruary  2, 2023  AC 33.83 -2B \\n5  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 8 ENGINE TEST CONDITIONS.  \\n8.1 Test Spe eds. \\nSection 33.83(b) requires vibration surveys from the minimum rotational speed up to \\n103 percent of the maximum physical and corrected rotational speed permitted for rating periods of two minutes or longer, and up to 100 percent of all other permitted physi cal and corrected rotational speeds, including overspeeds.  To determine the test \\nspeed,  the 103 percent  value  applies independently to each shaft  system’s physical and \\ncorrected speeds, as maximum physical and maximum corrected speeds are usually reached at different flight conditions.  Where multiple modules are attached to one \\nshaft, the shaft maximum corrected speed is the highest of the corrected speeds calculated for all modules on that shaft.  \\n8.2 Corrected  S\\n peeds.  \\nTesting to corrected speeds addresses operating conditions associated with ambient temperature  variations  throughout the flight  envelope. These conditions have  an effect \\non engine performance and airflow characteristics that in turn affect the vibratory response and behavior of certain components. Therefore, achieving the conditions associated with the corrected speeds is equally important as achieving the physical speeds.  \\n8.3 Spee\\n d Extensions.  \\nThe test program is intended to accomplish a stress survey for the ranges of conditions required under § 33.83(b). These conditions include  speed  extensions to investigate  the \\neffects of a vibratory stress peak arising at the highest of those required physical or corrected rotational speeds. \\n8.4 Altitude  E\\n ffects.  \\nThe effects of altitude may be represented and evaluated during an engine test \\nconducted in an altitude facility, or by flight test.  Usually, applicants will conduct \\nflight surveys  to supplement those  in test facilities  for which  applicants cannot achieve \\nthe desired  altitude  conditions. Unless  proven otherwise,  altitude  data acquired  during \\nflight surveys is valid for only the engine operating conditions in existence during the \\nflight test and the specific aircraft installations.  For example,  if the applicant conducts \\na flight test to acquire altitude data related to the inlet distortion, but the most adverse inlet distortion required by §33.83(c)(1) is not present during the flight test, then additional testing may be necessary. \\n8.5 Engine  M\\n odifications.  \\nDuring testing, the applicant may choose to modify  or adjust  the engine to achieve the \\ndesired physical and corrected speeds, or any other test conditions. The applicant \\nshould evaluate any alterations made to the engine to ensure that their effects are not detrimental to the engine, or compromise the intent of the test and test results.  The \\napplicant should identify how the engine operating parameters, as well as the components and system characteristics, are affected by these modifications, and evaluate their effects on the component or module vibratory behavior. Before a  \\n  AC 3 3.83-2B \\n6 certification test, the applicant may need to assess these adjustments by test , analysis, or \\nboth.  \\n8.6 Inlet Airflow Distortion . \\nInlet airflow distortion as set forth in  § 33.83(c)(1) may be  associated with crosswinds, \\nor with other operating and aircraft installation conditions.  Whether the engine test is \\nperformed in a test cell or flight test bed, the evaluations must be conducted for the \\nmost adverse inlet airflow distortion pattern decl ared by the  manufacturer, as required \\nby § 33.83(c)(1).   During testing, the applicant may achieve inlet distortion by various \\nmeans, such as external crosswind devices, inlet distortion plates, or suppression \\nscreens.  \\nNote :  Section 33.7(c)(13) requires the applicant to establish the operating limitations  \\nfor inlet air distortion at the engine inlet .  The applicant must declare the inlet air \\ndistortion in the installation and operating manuals , as well as  the type certificate data \\nsheet per §§ 33.5 and 33 .7(a), respectively.  \\n8.7 Combined Ef fects . \\nSection 33.83(c)(1) requires evaluation of the effects on vibration characteristics of \\noperating with scheduled changes (including tolerances) to variable  vane angles  and \\ncompressor bleeds.   In addition to the individ ual effects that variable vane angles and \\ncompressor air bleeds have on vibrations, the applicant should also consider the effects \\nof their concurrent usage throughout engine operation.  \\n9 FLUTTER.  \\n9.1 Sections 33.83(a) and (c)(2) require evaluation by engine tes t of the aerodynamic and \\naeromechanical factors that might induce or influence flutter.  The applicant should \\nconfigure the test to address the effects of hardware design variability, intake \\nconditions, and the margins associated with engine deterioration.   Applicants should \\nconsider the following : \\n\\uf0b7 The ranges of physical and corrected rotational speeds for each rotor system;  \\n\\uf0b7 The ranges of operating lines within the flight envelope; and  \\n\\uf0b7 The most adverse of other inlet air conditions encountered within the flight \\nenvelope  (for example, applicable combinations of total air pressure, density, \\ntemperature, and inlet distortion ). \\n9.2 Flutter is a phenomenon sensitive to even small variations of those design factors that \\ndetermine the engine system response.  The app licant should consider these factors, \\nincluding the variations between the nominal and extreme values of tip clearances, \\nmechanical damping, operating lines, bleed flows, etc.  Experience has also shown \\ndifferences in susceptibility to flutter from one bla de set to another.  \\n9.3 The applicant sh ould ensure the engine is free from  flutter  throughout the declared \\noperating environment for the engine  and show satisfactory vibratory clearance to \\nFebruary  2, 2023  AC 33.83 -2B \\n7  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n flutter boundaries.  In extreme transient regimes, flutter may be acceptable, providing \\nthe applicant completes a thorough investigation of the flutter and its effects.  The \\ninvestigation should show that the engine’s structural and operational integrity are free \\nfrom negative effects.  However,  the resulting  vibration  stresses must always satisfy  the \\nrequirements of § 33.83(d). \\n10 V IBRATORY STRESSES  AND MATERIAL ALLOWABLES.  \\n10.1 Mea sured  Stresses.  \\nDuring the vibration surveys required by § 33.83(a), the applicant should take stress measurements at critical or  limiting  locations.  When these locations are not suitable or \\naccessible, applicants may  measure the stresses n earby, providing that the  relationships \\nbetween the stresses at these locations and those at critical locations are known and predictable. To identify the accessible locations that best represent the critical stresses, \\nthe applicant  should use experience,  analysis,  or testing  to gain a detailed  knowledge of \\neach normal mode and associated stress distributions, as required by § 33.83(a). The \\napplicant should perform this investigation before the certification test.  \\n10.2 In\\nterpreting  Test Results.  \\nThe total vibra tory stress at any given location is the sum of the resonant stresses \\nassociated with all active and concurrent normal modes, plus any other vibratory stresses that occur at that particular rotational speed.  In addition, when calculating the \\nresonant stresses, the applicant should consider the stress amplitudes that occur within the blade- to-blade variations of natural frequencies. For example, if for a particular \\nblade design, the natural frequency  range is fn ± 2.5 percent,  then the amplitudes  within \\nthis range should be considered. \\n10.3 M\\naterial Allowable  Stresses.  \\nThe material properties or allowable stresses for showing  compliance with § 33.83(d) \\nare the minimum endurance limits associated with specific mean or steady stresses, usually represented on a Goodman diagram. In addition, these material properties should account for the effects of manufacturing processes, the lo cal geometrical \\nfeatures,  and temperatures,  as applicable.  The applicant  should provide these material \\nproperties in compliance with § 33.15. \\n10.4 S\\ntress Margins.  \\nSection  33.83(d) requires suitable  stress margins  for each component evaluated,  usually \\nrepresented  by the stress  margins  at the critical,  or limiting  locations.  The stress margin \\nis represented  by the difference  between  the material allowable stresses for that location \\nand the vibratory stress at that location. When stresses are not directly measured at \\ncritical locations, they may be derived based on the measurements taken at reference locations. The applicant should ensure the criteria  for stress margin  suitab ility accounts \\nfor the variability  in design, operation, and other mitigating  factors  identified  during the \\ncertification test.  In addition, the applicant should consider the effects of expected \\nserviceable damages during operation. For example, consider fan and compressor \\nFebruary  2, 2023  AC 33.83 -2B \\n8  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n blades nicks  and surface discontinuities caused  by debris ingestion. These damages \\nmay increase local stresses or may lower the component fatigue strength.  \\n11 RES ONANT DWELL.  \\nDuring the vibration  surveys required by § 33.83(a), the applicant  should determine  all \\nsignificant resonances and allow sufficient time for the resonant modes to respond. \\nThis i s usually accomplished during slow acceleration and deceleration speed sweeps \\ncovering the range of required  speeds.  If any  significant  resonance is found within  the \\noperating conditions required under § 33.83, then the relevant components should be \\nsubjec t to sufficient cycles of vibration near or on the resonance peak.  This resonant \\ndwell testing would normally be incorporated into the incremental periods of § 33.87, as required by § 33.87(b)(4), (c)(5),  and (d)(5).  In this case,  the components subject to \\nresonant dwells under the endurance test of §33.87(b)(4), (c)(5), and (d)(5) must meet the teardown requirements of § 33.93(a) (see AC 33.87-1). \\n12 F\\nAULT CONDITIONS.  \\n12.1 S ection 33.83(e) includes those fault conditions that would cause abnormal vibra tions \\nthat are difficult to identify in a timely manner for appropriate action and may escalate to the hazardous engine effects  identified  in § 33.75. The fault conditions include rotor \\nsystem out -of-balance, incorrectly scheduled compressor variables, blo ckage or \\nenlargement of passages between stator vanes, and blockages of fuel nozzles.  For \\nexample, the loss of a compressor airfoil tip would likely result in an increased vibration. Although rotor out- of-balance may be indicated by the connection required \\nby § 33.29(b), the resulting  vibration  might not be immediately  recognized  as abnormal \\nor prompt immediate action, and could cause further damage.  Other fault conditions, \\nsuch as incorrectly  scheduled compressor variables or blockages of stator vanes or fuel \\nnozzles could produce air distortions and changes in the airflow or pressure distributions that in turn may affect the engine vibratory response and characteristics. \\n12.2 To a\\n ddress these fault conditions, the applicant may use prior experience with faults \\nthat occurred with similar engines.  Successful experiences are when, after a fault \\ncondition occurred, the engine was able to either  continue a safe operation  or be shut \\ndown without creating a hazardous condition. The applicant may also use field \\nexperience or other means to show that certain fault conditions are unlikely  to occur \\nbecause of specific engine configurations or operating conditions. \\n13 I NSTALLATION COMPATIBILITY.  \\nSection  33.83(f) ensures that the vibration  surveys conducted  in accordance with  \\n§ 33.83 are representative of each intended installation  configuration. The applicant \\nshould identify in the installation manual the necessary installation instructions, as required in compliance with § 33.5. Sufficient instructions will assure that the \\ninstallation on the aircraft would not adversely affect the engine\\'s vibration characteristics when  the installer follows  those instructions.  The applicant may  also \\nFebruary  2, 2023  AC 33.83 -2B \\n9  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n consider imposing operating limitations  and procedures when  establishing  the vibratory \\ncompatibility  between  the engine and its installation.  The applicant  should consider  the \\nfollowing features:  \\n• Each  propeller approved for use on the engine.  \\n• Each  thrust reverser  approved for use on the engine.  \\n• Installation  influences on inlet and exhaust  conditions.  \\n• Mount stiffness.  \\n• Rotor drive systems.  \\n• Accessory  components.  \\n14 I NSTRUMENTATION.  \\n14.1 Ty pes  of Instrumentation.  \\nWhen  conducting the vibration  surveys required  under § 33.83, the applicant should use \\nsuitable instrumentation, data acquisition, and analyzer systems.  Vibration specific \\ninstrumentation  may include dynamic strain  gauges, accelerometers,  and time-of-arrival \\nsensors, as well as instrumentation indicating the airflow characteristics.  \\n14.2 Fo r  the most part, vibratory  stresses are measured with dynamic strain gauges placed at \\npre-determined locations and oriented to measure specific directional strains.  These \\nstrain  gauges should maintain  their accuracy  throughout the test conditions, particularly \\nthrough repeated exposure to high temperatures. \\n14.3 O ther measurement means may be acceptable.  For example, time -of-arrival sensors, \\nsuch as optical sensors or light probes, may be used as alternatives  to strain  gauges, or \\nto supplement strain gauge data, provided they are properly calibrated and their \\ncapabilities are clearly  understood. The most common application for time -of-arrival \\nsensors is to measure the blade’s tip displacements, then convert them to stresses at specific blade locations. Converting displacements to stresses requires detailed \\nknowledge of the blade’s normal modes, mode shapes, and associated tip displacements.  \\n14.4 I\\nf during the vibration survey there is an accidental loss of test instrumentation, the \\nmissing data ma y be replaced by the use of validated analysis providing that the \\nvalidation can be achieved using the data from the surviving instrumentation. Therefore,  the loss of instrumentation  should be minimal,  and the data acquired by the \\nsurviving instrumentation  should be adequate for the purpose of validating the \\nanalytical predictions. \\n15 CO\\n MPLIANCE  FOR  MAJOR CHANGES  IN DESIGN BY SIMILARITY.  \\nMajor  design  changes for which  compliance can be based  on a similar  engine vibration \\ntest (further referred to as the baseline engine test) does not require repeating a  \\nFebruary  2, 2023  AC 33.83 -2B \\n10  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n v\\nibration  survey test. The baseline engine test should be FAA-approved in accordance \\nwith § 33.83 requirements, at the same amendment level, and should be run on an \\nengine or module (see paragraph 7.3 of this AC for rig or module testing). \\n15.1 S imilarity  Assessment.  \\n15.1.1 T he applicant should demonstrate the similarity between the engine undergoing \\ncertification and the baseline engine by using comparative test and analysis methods. Specifically,  the hardware and test running conditions should be closely  similar,  and the \\ndifferences should not significantly affect the vibratory behavior of the engine, its systems, or its components.  The comparative test and analysis should show all of the \\nfollowing:  \\n15.1.1.1 Th\\n e differences relative  to the baseline would result  in only minor  changes \\nto the vibratory stresses of the baseline engine, which  could be scaled  with \\nconfidence.  \\n15.1.1.2 Th e certification  engine test conditions are not more  severe  than those of \\nthe baseline engine test.  To assess the test conditions in the engine, the \\napplicant should compare the certification  engine vs. the baseline engine \\nwith regard to all of the following requirements — \\n• The test conditions required by § 33.83(b), for example, shaft rotational speeds ( mechanical  and corrected),  gas path temperatures, \\nthrust or power, and if applicable, torque.  \\n• The test conditions required by § 33.83(c)(1), for example, variable vane angles, compressor bleeds, accessory loading, the most adverse inlet airflow  distortion  pattern,  and the most adverse conditions in the \\nexhaust duct(s). \\n• The aerodynamic and aeromechanical  factors  that might induce or \\ninfluence flutter as set forth in § 33.83(c)(2).  \\n15.1.1.3 Th\\n e differences  in configuration, geometrical  characteristics,  or material \\nphysical properties do not significantly affect the component’s natural frequencies and  mode shapes, and no new resonances are introduced. \\n15.1.1.4 Th\\n e component’s temperatures,  pressures,  excitation  forces,  and damping \\ncharacteristics are closely similar throughout the ranges of the test parameters of § 33.83(b) and (c). \\n16 V\\nALIDATED ANALYSIS.  \\nFor ma jor design changes that do not qualify under the similarity criteria above, \\napplicants may request  approval of methods based  on validated  analysis in combination \\nwith engine vibration surveys as needed to validate the analysis and associated assumptions. The FAA has approved such methods on a case-by- case basis by issuing \\nan equivalent level of safety under § 21.21(b)(1), and by using the procedures outlined \\nFebruary  2, 2023  AC 33.83 -2B \\n11  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n in FAA Order  8110.112 for issue papers.  Alternatively,  the applicant  may run a fully  \\ninstrumented engine test in accordance with the requirements of § 33.83 and the \\nguidance in this AC. \\n17 S UGGESTIONS  FOR  IMPROVING  THIS  AC. \\nIf you have suggestions for improving  this AC, you may use the Advisory Circular \\nFeedback Form at the end of this AC. \\nDigitally signed by  \\nVICTOR  W WICKLUND \\nDate:  2023.02.02  \\n11:50:30 - 08\\'00\\'  \\nVictor Wicklund  \\nActing  Director,  Policy  and Innovation Division \\nAircraft Certification Service  \\nAdvisory Circular  Feedback Form  OMB  Control  Number:  2120 -0746  \\nExpiration  Date:  11/30/2024 \\nPaperwork Reduction Act Burden Statement:  A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not \\nrequired to respond to, nor shall a person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information \\nsubject  to the requirements  of the Paperwork  Reduction  Act unless  that collection  of information  displays  a currently  valid \\nOMB Control Number.

The primary \\nobjectives are to contain, isolate and withstand a fire; prevent any source offlammable material \\nfrom feeding an existing fire; perform those engine functions intended to be performed in the \\ncase offire, and not result in a hazardous condition. \\nb. Test Article: The test article should be type design or equivalent. Care should be taken to \\nassure that installation side connections are also type design or equivalent. \\nc. Fire Protection Capability -Determination ofFireproof vs. Fire Resistant: Section \\n33.17(b) requires all flammable fluid conveying parts or components be fire resistant or \\nfireproof, as applicable, while§ 33.17(c) generally requires flammable fluid tanks and associated \\nshutoff means to be fireproof Therefore, it must be determined which level offire protection \\ncapability must be shown for each component requiring a fire protection evaluation. A fire \\nresistant standard is generally applied to components that are required to provide certain \\n2 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\nfunction(s) for the first five minutes of a fire in order to give the flight crew time to detect the \\nfire and safely shutdown the engine. Controls whose failure or malfunction could contribute to \\nthe spread offire after engine shutdown must be fireproof \\n(1) In general, components which convey flammable fluids can be evaluated to a fire \\nresistant standard, provided the normal supply offlammable fluid can be stopped by a shutoff \\nfeature (also refer to§ 33.71(c)(8)). For example, the fire resistant criteria has been applied to \\nengine fuel system components because the 5 minute exposure provides a reasonable time period \\nfor the flight crew to recognize a fire condition, close the appropriate fuel shutoff valve(s), and \\nshut down the appropriate engine, thereby cutting offthe fuel source. \\n(2) However, oil system components ofturbine engines may continue to flow oil after the \\nengine has been shutdown due to continued rotation (windmilling). These effects include the \\nrotation ofgearbox mounted oil pump(s), and subsequent oil flow through the lubrication \\nsystem. The supply ofoil to the fire might exist for as long as the continued rotation effects are \\npresent, or until the oil supply is depleted. Therefore, oil system components need to be \\nevaluated from a fire hazard perspective (for example, quantity, pressure, flow rate, etc.) to \\ndetermine whether the fire resistant or fire proof standard should apply. Historically, it should be \\nnoted that most oil system components have been evaluated to a fireproof standard. \\n(3) Other flammable fluid conveying components, such as those part ofhydraulic and \\nthrust augmentation systems, must be evaluated in a similar manner as described in paragraphs \\n4.c. and 4.c.(1) and (2) ofthis AC. However, flammable fluid tanks generally must be fireproof \\nin accordance with§ 33.17(c). Fluid tanks are discussed in paragraph 7.a. ofthis AC. \\n(4) Section 3 3 .17 ( e) requires all engine control system components be fire resistant or \\nfireproof, as applicable. Similar to § 33 .17(b ), it must be determined which level offire \\nprotection capability must be demonstrated for the affected components. The requirement does \\nnot differentiate between control technologies, such as electronic, mechanical or fiber-optic \\ncomponents. However, ifthe component is flammable fluid conveying, then§ 33.17(b) would \\napply. For other non-flammable fluid conveying control components, a fire resistant or fireproof \\nstandard is determined as described in paragraph 4.c. of this AC. Therefore, the function ofthe \\ncomponent must be considered when making this determination. Control components include, \\nbut are not limited to, electronic controllers, electro-mechanical metering devices, electrical \\nharnesses, valves, fiber optic devices, etc. \\n(5) Note that§§ 23.1189(a), 25.1189 (a), and 29.1189(a) require a shutoff valve in \\nall flammable fluid conveying components flowing into, within or through designated \\nfire zones. However, shutoff means are not required for oil systems for turbine engine \\ninstallations in which all components of the system in a designated fire zone, including \\noil tanks, are fireproof or located in areas not subject to engine fire conditions. \\n3 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\nd. Fire Test Pass/Fail Criteria: In general, the following fire test criteria have been applied \\nand found to be acceptable: \\n(1) Maintain the ability to perform those functions intended to be provided in the case of \\nfire. The functions intended to be provided in the case of fire will be determined on a case by \\ncase basis. The following examples are included only to illustrate the case by case nature of \\nmaking this determination. The applicant, along with the appropriate FAA Aircraft Certification \\nOffice (ACO) should coordinate early in the program in this regard. \\n(a) Engine fuel control components must not cause a hazardous condition while \\ncontinuing to operate, but must allow (or may cause) a safe shutdown ofthe engine at any time \\nwithin the required exposure time period. A safe engine shutdown at any time during the fire test \\nis an acceptable outcome for this type of component, provided the safe shutdown is maintained \\nuntil the end ofthe fire test period. \\n(b) For a shutoff valve which must be fireproof, the valve must be operable to the \\nclosed position after 5 minutes fire exposure, or should default closed, and be capable of \\nmaintaining this position without leakage ofa hazardous quantity for the full 15 minute fireproof \\ntest. \\n(2) No leakage ofhazardous quantities offlammable fluids, vapors or other materials. At \\nno time during, or at the end ofthe test, should the test article leak a hazardous quantity of \\nflammable fluid in any manner. Pressurized lines should remain pressurized during and \\nfollowing the test. Observation ofthe test article for a period after the test flame is removed, and \\nwith the test article still pressurized, is generally needed to determine ifleakage has occurred and \\nto what extent. Hazardous quantity is defined in paragraph 3. ofthis AC. \\n(3) No support ofan existing fire event by the constituent material ofthe test article or by \\nflammable fluid or material leaking from the test article. \\n(4) No residual fire. For example, a rapid self-extinguishing flame and no re-ignition after \\ntest flame removal is generally acceptable. However, consideration must be given to fires that \\ncontinue to burn after removal ofthe test flame. This type of event could be either combustion \\nof the constituent material ofthe test article, or combustion of flammable fluid leaking from the \\ncomponent (firewalls are not considered in either case). In general, these events are cause for \\nfailure ofthe test, unless it can be shown the residual fire will not significantly increase the \\noverall fire hazard. The acceptability ofsuch a test result will be determined on a case by case \\nbasis, and will consider the type and function ofthe component under test. \\n(5) No failure of a firewall. See paragraph 7(e) ofthis AC for further discussion of \\nfirewalls. \\n4 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\n(6) No other hazardous condition should result. At no time during, or at the end ofthe test, \\nshould a hazardous condition result. A hazardous condition is defined in paragraph 3. ofthis \\nAC. \\n5. MATERIALS DESIGN ASSESSMENT. When showing compliance with§ 33.17(a), the \\napplicant should conduct a design assessment ofmaterials. Experience has shown that when \\nusing certain materials (for example, magnesium and titanium alloys), appropriate design \\nprecautions may be required to prevent an unacceptable fire hazard. Consideration should be \\ngiven to the possibility offire if certain materials rub or contact hot gases. Any materials used \\nfor abradable linings need to be assessed to ensure that fire or explosion hazards are avoided. \\na. Use ofTitanium: Many titanium alloys used in the manufacture ofengine components \\nwill ignite and sustain combustion under certain conditions. In general, titanium fires bum very \\nfast and are extremely intense. The molten particles in titanium fires generate highly erosive hot \\nsprays that have burned through compressor casings with resulting radial expulsion of molten or \\nincandescent metal. When showing compliance with § 33 .17(a), the applicant should assess the \\noverall design for vulnerability to titanium fires. Ifthis assessment cannot rule out the possibility \\nofa sustained fire, then it should be shown that a titanium fire does not result in a hazardous \\ncondition. Additional information on the use oftitanium parts in aircraft engines can be found in \\nAC 33-4, titled \"Design Considerations Concerning the Use ofTitanium in Aircraft Turbine \\nEngines\" (see Appendix 1, reference number 3 ofthis AC). \\nb. Use ofMagnesium: Many magnesium alloys used in the manufacture of engine \\ncomponents are highly combustible when in finely divided form, such as chips or powder. \\nTherefore, magnesium use should be carefully evaluated when used in thin sections, or where \\nrubbing or high scrubbing speeds will be a consideration. Additional information on the use of \\nmagnesium parts in aircraft engines can be found in FAA Report No.FAA-ADS-14, titled \"A \\nStudy ofthe Flammability ofMagnesium\" (see Appendix 1, reference number 9 ofthis AC) .. \\nWhen showing compliance with § 33.17(a), the applicant should assess the overall design for \\nvulnerability to magnesium fires. Ifthis assessment cannot rule out the possibility ofa sustained \\nfire, then it should be shown that a magnesium fire will not result in a hazardous condition. \\nc. Abradable Linings: Many fan, compressor, and turbine modules have abradable linings \\nbetween rotating blade tips and stator casings, and in certain seal applications. Depending upon \\nthe material used in the abradable lining, experience has shown that a fire or explosion can occur \\nin the presence of an ignition source ifa significant amount oflining is removed during rubs \\nbetween the rotor and stator, or in labyrinth seals. Under certain conditions, auto-ignition can \\noccur in the mixture ofsmall abradable particles and hot flowpath gases or in bearing \\ncompartments. These situations should be evaluated by the applicant for each fan, compressor, \\nand turbine stage with abradable linings, and for other rotating seal applications. \\n5 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\nd. Absorbent Materials: Ifabsorbent materials are used in close proximity to flammable fluid \\nsystem components, they must be treated or covered to prevent the absorption ofa hazardous \\nquantity of flammable fluid. \\ne. Fiber and Resin Materials: Certain fiber and resin materials, such as aramid fiber (for \\nexample, kevlar fabric) or carbon/graphite composites may be combustible under certain \\ncircumstances. In engines, aramid fabric is typically used as part of fan rotor containment \\nsystems. Carbon/graphite composites have also been used for fan blades, thrust reverser \\ncomponents, and other parts. When showing compliance with§ 33.17(a), the applicant should \\nassess the overall design for vulnerability to fires supported by these materials. Ifthe assessment \\ncannot rule out the possibility ofthese components supporting a sustained fire, then it should be \\nshown that such a fire will not result in a hazardous condition. \\n6. CONDUCT OF FIRE TESTS. \\na Test Equipment: Guidance on acceptable burner types, burner configurations, and other \\ntest hardware can be found in AC 20-135, titled \"Powerplant Installation and Propulsion System \\nComponent Fire Protection Methods, Standards, and Criteria\", and FAA Report No. 3A, titled \\n\"Standard Fire Test Apparatus and Procedures\" (see Appendix 1, reference numbers 1 and 2 of \\nthis AC). Pre and post test calibrations ofburner equipment are generally required. Measured \\nburner flame temperature fluctuations during the test are acceptable only when the pre and post \\ntest calibrations are within the prescribed limits, and test burner controlling parameters are \\nconstant during the test. Experience has shown the measured temperature ofthe flame could be \\naffected by the presence ofthe component under test. \\nb. Flame Impingement Location: The FAA has accepted the following methods for \\ndetermining fire test flame impingement locations: \\n(1) General Method: The test flame should be applied to the test article feature(s), which \\nare determined by analysis or test, to be critical with respect to surviving the effects ofthe fire. \\nFor this approach, determination ofthe flame impingement location(s) should consider, as a \\nminimum, the following potential factors: \\n• Materials; \\n• Geometry; \\n• Part critical features; \\n• Local torching effects; \\n• Vibration; \\n• Internal fluid level/pressure/flow rate; \\n• Surface coatings; \\n• Fire protection features; \\n• Wetting; and \\n• Other factors not listed may also apply. \\n6 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\n(2) Installation Analysis Method: For this method, the test plan may consider all potential \\nsources of fire in the intended installation when determining the test flame impingement location \\nrequirements. The intent is to identify locations or features that cannot be directly impinged by \\nfire, and evaluate the critical features at locations that can be directly impinged. Ifthe applicant \\nchooses this installation analysis approach, it should be based on the actual intended installation, \\nand should consider, as a minimum, the potential factors noted above, and specifically the \\nfollowing potential installation factors: \\n• Cowling and nacelle structure; \\n• Adjacent structure shielding; \\n• Undercowl airflow; \\n• Aircraft engine build up (EBU) hardware; \\n• Fuel sources; \\n• Air sources; and \\n• Other factors not listed may also apply. \\nSuch installation analyses should avoid simple generalities, such as \"the most likely flame \\ndirection is vertical assuming fuel collects at the bottom ofthe cowl,\" and should generally be \\ncoordinated with the installer before the test plan is submitted. Ifthis approach is used, each new \\ninstallation will need to be re-evaluated against the original fire protection substantiation to \\nconfirm its applicability to the new installation. A notation in the installation instructions may be \\nnecessary to explain this limitation. Lastly, due consideration should be given to fire protection \\nfeatures such as fire shields, fire protective coatings, or other methods, so as to not discourage or \\ninvalidate their use for fire prevention purposes. \\nc. Operating Parameters for Test Articles: The operating characteristics and parameters of \\nthe test article should be consistent, but conservative, relative to the conditions that might occur \\nduring an actual fire situation in the type design product. For example, where a high internal \\nfluid flow increases the heat sink effect, and is less conservative with respect to fire \\nsusceptibility, a minimum flow condition should be specified for the test. The same is true for \\nexamples relating to internal fluid temperatures, quantity, or other parameters. This evaluation \\nprimarily concerns critical inflight operating conditions, including continued rotation \\n(windmilling and propeller feathering) after shutdown. Consideration of engine basic failure \\nstates (for example, mechanically damaged component, or locked main rotor) are not generally \\nunder consideration when evaluating test conditions. In addition, any facility slave hardware \\nused to establish boundary conditions for the test (for example, simulated engine heat exchanger) \\nmust do so in a manner representing type design operation. \\nd. Other Guidance: Other guidance on acceptable methods of conducting fire tests can be \\nfound in AC 20-135, and FAA Report No. 3A (see Appendix 1, reference numbers 1 and 2 of \\nthis AC). \\n7 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\n7. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. \\na. Flammable Fluid Tanks: \\n(1) Flame Impingement Location: In the absence ofan acceptable installation assessment, \\nthe fire test flame should be applied to the tank location(s) or feature(s) that have been \\ndetermined, by analysis or test, to be critical regarding surviving the effects ofthe fire (that is, \\nthe location(s) or feature(s) least likely to survive the test conditions or meet the test pass/fail \\ncriteria). In selecting the flame application location(s), all features ofthe tank assembly must be \\nconsidered. Typical tank installation features include, but are not limited to: \\n• Tank body; \\n• Inlet and outlet assemblies; \\n• Sight-gauge; \\n• Drain plug; \\n• Magnetic chip detector; \\n• Quantity sender assembly; \\n• Vent line assembly; \\n• Fill cap and scupper; \\n• Mounts; \\n• Shutoff valve; \\n• Temperature sensor; and \\n• Air/fluid separator assembly . \\nTanks can be designed and manufactured with any combination ofthe above features, or other \\nfeatures not listed, and ofvarying materials. Therefore, in some instances, compliance with \\n§ 33 .17 may need to be supported by data from other fire tests, multiple location testing, \\nsubcomponent level tests, or service experience, to cover all tank assembly features. Also, other \\naspects of determining impingement location should be considered, such as vent system \\nperformance (for example, oil tank fire tests have failed due to high internal pressure and \\ninadequate venting), the lack ofheat sink effect for tank features at or above the operating level \\n(that is, the water line) ofthe tanks fluid contents; and the affect ofany special protective \\nfeatures (for example, shields, coatings, feature placement, etc.) incorporated into the design \\nwhen developing the fire test plan. \\n(2) Other Test Parameters: With respect to fluid quantity, the tank quantity at the start of \\nthe test should be no greater than the minimum dispatchable quantity minus the normal gulping \\nvolume, unless a greater quantity is more severe. Relative to flow rate, the first five minutes of \\nthe test should be conducted at the most critical operating condition (typically a minimum flight \\nidle flow rate), and the subsequent 10 minutes should be conducted at an engine shutdown flow \\nrate (continued rotation considered). The test may be run, at the applicant\\'s option, for 15 \\nminutes at the most critical condition (worst case ofengine operating or inflight shutdown \\nconditions). \\n8 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\n(3) Fluid temperature should be at its maximum value (greater of steady-state or transient \\nlimit established under§ 33.7) at the start ofthe test, unless a lower temperature is more severe. \\nThe tank internal pressure should be the normal working pressure for the operating conditions at \\nthe start ofthe test. It is understood these values may change due to the test conditions. \\n(4) The tank design and its intended application should be reviewed, and provide \\nreasonable assurance the test set-up reflects the most critical flame impingement orientation and \\noperating conditions for the intended application. The aircraft requirements of parts 23, 25, 27, \\nand 29 rely heavily on the fire prevention findings of part 33. Failure to adequately test may \\nresult in aircraft installation issues. \\nb. Air Sources: In accordance with§ 33.17(a), the applicant should evaluate the effect of fire \\non components conveying bleed air, and evaluate whether failure ofsuch components could \\nfurther increase the severity or duration ofa fire within a fire zone. \\nc. Engine Mounts: The fire protection requirements for engine mount systems (including \\nengine type design) are governed by the aircraft regulations, and compliance is shown as part of \\nthe aircraft certification. The engine manufacturer should coordinate with the installer to \\nminimize the possibility ofinstallation issues affecting aircraft certification. \\nd. Hot Surface Ignition (HSI): Information concerning hot surface ignition is available in \\nSAE Report No. 690436, titled \"Ignition of Aircraft Fluids on High Temperature Engine \\nSurfaces\", and FAA Report No. FAA-RD-75-155, titled \"Ignition and Propagation Rates for \\nFlames in a Fuel Mist\" (see Appendix 1, reference numbers 7 and 8 of this AC). \\ne. Firewalls (§ 33 .17(d)): If a component\\'s primary function is that of a firewall, and is part \\nofthe engine type design, then it must comply with the requirements of§ 33.17(d). For test \\ndemonstrations, at no time during or at the end of a fire test should the firewall component fail to \\ncontain the fire within the intended zone or area. Acceptable evidence that the fire is contained \\nwould be ifthe firewall component does not develop a bum through hole, does not fail at any \\nattachment or fire seal point around its periphery, does not cause backside ignition, and does not \\ncontinue to bum after the test flame is removed. Also, in no case should a hazardous quantity of \\nfuel or fuel/air mixture leak around or pass through the firewall. In addition, the firewall should \\ncontain the fire without resulting in a hazardous condition. The effects of pressure and \\nmechanical loading on the firewall structure and associated seals must be considered when \\nevaluating overall firewall capability and testing under§ 33.17. AC 20-135 provides additional \\nguidance for the testing and evaluation of firewalls and fire seals (see Appendix 1, reference \\nnumber 1 and ofthis AC). Also, firewall components will also be evaluated at the aircraft level \\n(for example, §§ 1191 and 1193 ofparts 23, 25, 27, and 29). Lastly, firewalls must be protected \\nagainst corrosion as required by§ 33 .17(d)(3). \\n9 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\nf Shielding(§ 33.17(b)): The overall intent ofthe§ 33.17(b) requirement concerning the \\nshielding and location ofcomponents, is to minimize the possibility ofleaking flammable fluids \\ncontacting ignition sources and igniting. Ignition sources include hot surfaces with temperatures \\nat or above the typical auto-ignition temperature for aviation fuels, oils, and hydraulic fluids, or \\nany component that produces an electrical discharge. Compliance with this requirement has \\nbeen shown by installation ofdrainage shrouds around flammable fluid lines or fittings; \\ninstallation ofspray shields to deflect leaking fuel away from ignition sources; and general \\ncomponent location on the engine which minimizes the possibility of starting and supporting a \\nfire. Therefore, the overall substantiation should show that leaked flammable fluid would not \\nlikely impinge on an ignition source to the extent of starting and supporting a fire. For kerosene \\ntype fuels, an auto-ignition temperature of450° F has been accepted, although fuel/air ratio, \\nnacelle venting and other factors may play a role in determining whether hot surface ignition is a \\nhazard for a given design. Information concerning hot surface ignition is available in SAE \\nReport No. 690436, and FAA Report No. FAA-RD-75-155 (see Appendix 1, reference numbers \\n7 and 8 ofthis AC). \\ng. Drains and Vent Systems(§ 33.17(b) and (t)): Certain drain and vent systems maybe \\nexempt from the requirements of§ 33.17(b) ifit can be shown they do not typically contain or \\nconvey flammable fluids during normal engine operation. In this context, normal operation is \\nthe taxi and flight portions of a typical flight. An example ofa drain line that might be exempt is \\na combustor drain line that typically drains off residual fuel after an aborted engine start. An \\nexample of a tube or line which would not be exempt is a shrouded fuel manifold. Such a line is \\nconsidered a single assembly that cannot be separated into its main fuel line and its outer drain \\nline (which would flow ifthe main manifold failed). In the case ofa drain and vent system line \\nthat would flow a hazardous quantity of flammable fluid during continued rotation, then a \\nfireproof standard may be appropriate. A drain collection reservoir that stores a hazardous \\namount offlammable fluid would likely be evaluated against a fireproof standard. The function \\nofeach drain or vent system component should be carefully reviewed in making these \\ndeterminations. Lastly, a drain and vent system flow capacity should be equal to the maximum \\nflow rate that the drain or vent line may need to convey. \\nh. Electrical Bonding (§ 33 .17(g)): Electrical bonding is a means to protect against the effects \\nofunintentional electrical discharges or fault currents. Specifically, bonding can help minimize \\nthe risk ofthe ignition of flammable materials from static electrical discharges. Components, \\nmodules or equipment that may cause, or are susceptible to such effects must be electrically \\nbonded (grounded) to the main engine reference. Conductive parts are considered to be bonded \\nwhen they are mechanically interconnected to maintain a common electrical potential. This may \\nbe shown by an examination ofthe type design drawings, electrical continuity checks, and \\nphysical inspection ofa representative engine. An additional benefit ofgood electrical bonding \\nofengine components is the minimization of electromagnetic interference of electrical \\nequipment, especially controls. \\n10 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA \\t 8/3/09 \\ni. Powerplant Designated Fire Zones: Powerplant fire zones are designated regions of a \\npowerplant installation as identified in parts 23, 25 and 29, specifically§ 1181 in each part. A \\ngeneric definition offire zone is a flammable fluid leakage zone that contains a nominal ignition \\nsource. Aircraft areas outside power-plant installations can also be a fire zone. \\n8. TEST PLANS. \\na. Certification test plans should include, but are not limited to, the following information: \\n• \\t Component name(s); \\n• \\t Part number(s); \\n• \\t Part detail drawing(s) or sketches (for example, denote critical features); \\n• \\t Installation drawing(s) or sketches (for example, describe installation in an \\nengine); \\n• \\t Description of component operation; \\n• \\t Hardware reconciliation to type design (test article and installation connections); \\n• \\t Definition and range of component operating parameters; \\n• \\t Flame direction/impingement analysis; \\n• \\t Fireproot7fire resistant analysis; \\n• \\t Test equipment, test set-up, calibrations, and test fluids; \\n• \\t Test methods and procedures; \\n• \\t Test pass/fail criteria; \\n• \\t Data recording methods; \\n• \\t Applicable regulations; and \\n• \\t Time and place of test. \\nb. The proposed certification test plan should contain as a minimum; the information \\ndescribed in paragraph 8.a. of this AC, and should be submitted to the applicable FAA ACO for \\ncoordination and approval before conducting the fire testing. \\nc. The cognizant ACO and engine manufacturer should review the part 33 compliance plan, \\nensuring the fire prevention intent and objective of each part 33 section is met. Regarding the \\naircraft requirements of parts 23, 25, 27, and 29 listed in AC 20-135, the applicant should be \\nencouraged to review these sections with the installer early in the program to minimize potential \\ninstallation problems after engine certification. \\n(~~fY,v~ )(!--~_,yJL,, ___,_ \\nFrancis A Favara, \\nManager, Engine and Propeller Directorate \\nAircraft Certification Service \\n11 \\n\\nAC 33.17-lA 8/3/09 \\nAPPENDIX 1 \\nREFERENCES \\n1.

Purpose. This advisory circular (AC) provides general guidance concerning type certification \\nprojects for aircraft turbine engines. This AC applies to certain sections of Title 14 of the Code of \\nFederal Regulations (14 CFR) parts  21, 33, and 45, and describes or references methods of \\ncompliance that may be acceptable for engine type certification work. This guidance is general in \\nnature, and where necessary, further reference is made to other documents, which may be the \\nprimary source for information on a particular  subject. \\n2. Applicability. \\na. The guidance provided in this document is directed to engine manufacturers, modifiers, \\nforeign regulatory authorities, and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) engine type certification designees. \\nb. This material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulations. We (\"the FAA\") will still consider other methods an applicant may present to demonstrate compliance. Terms such as \"should,\" \"may,\" and \"must\" are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the method in this document is used. While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with relevant \\nregulations. If we find that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable \\nregulations, we will not be bound by this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the \\nbasis for finding compliance. \\nc. This material does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n3. Cancellation. AC 33-2B, \"Aircraft Engine Type Certification Handbook,\" dated June 30, \\n1993,  is cancelled. \\n4. Related Documents. Please check the GPO Access website at  http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov  for \\nparts  21, 33, and 45 of 14 CFR. \\n6/25/13  AC 33-2C \\n5. Related Reading Material. Please check the FAA\\'s website at \\nhttp://www.faa.gov/reRulations  policies/ for the latest revision of the following documents: \\na. Order  8110.4  et seq., \"Type Certification.\" \\nb. Order  8110.52  et seq., \"Type Validation and Post-Type Validation Procedures.\" \\n6. General Type Certification Process. This AC provides guidance to the public about several \\nsubjects that can be encountered during the engine certification program. In addition, this AC \\nprovides intent and method of compliance guidance for selected part 33 regulations that do not \\nhave an independent  AC.  It should be noted that, beyond this AC, a number of documents exist \\nwhich provide guidelines for type certification. Order  8110.4  et seq., \"Type Certification,\" \\ncontains details of the type certification process and is used by the FAA for  U.S.  domestic \\nprograms. Order  8110.52  et seq., \"Type Validation and Post-Type Validation Procedures,\" \\ncontains details of the process that we use for  non-U.  S. applicants seeking an FAA type \\ncertificate (TC) or when  U.S.  applicants seek a foreign TC. Lastly, \"The FAA and Industry Guide \\nto Product Certification,\" has useful information about conducting type certification programs. \\nThe certificate managing Aircraft Certification Office (ACO) can provide information on how to obtain a copy of these orders or the guide. \\n7. Surplus Military Aircraft Engines and Parts. This section provides guidance for the type \\ncertification and airworthiness approval of military-surplus engines and parts. Regulations governing this process are §§ 21.25 and 21.27. \\na. Surplus Military Engines for Restricted Category Aircraft. \\n(1) Section 21.25(a)(2) permits type certification of surplus military aircraft from an \\nArmed Force of the United States (U.S. military), for the special purpose operations defined in \\n§ 21.25(b). The engine model supplied with the aircraft does not receive a separate TC; it is \\nincluded in the aircraft TC. Therefore, the supplied engines are not required to directly comply \\nwith part 33 requirements. For engine design changes proposed after the § 21.25 TC is issued, \\nsee Order\\n 8110.56  et seq. for instructions. \\n(2) The applicant must identify in the airworthiness limitations section of the aircraft \\ninstructions for continued airworthiness (ICA), the life limits and inspection intervals applicable \\nto the engine life limited parts. If the overall engine load and fatigue spectrum for the special \\npurpose operation is more severe than the U.S. military operation, applicants must determine if the existing life limit and inspection interval values are still applicable, or if revised values are necessary. Applicants may need to develop a fatigue life methodology to accomplish the above \\nactions. See Order\\n 8110.56  et seq. for instructions on determining life limits and preparing the \\nICA. \\n(3) The following references provide guidance for the activity of engine military surplus \\nand restricted category aircraft: \\n6/25/13  AC 33-2C \\n(a) Order  8110.4  et seq., \"Type Certification.\" \\n(b) AC 20-142, \"Eligibility and Evaluation of  U.S.  Military Surplus Flight Safety \\nCritical Aircraft Parts, Engines, and Propellers.\" \\n(c) AC 20-62E, \"Eligibility, Quality, and Identification of Aeronautical Replacement \\nParts.\" \\n(d) Order  8110.56  et seq., \"Restricted Category Type Certification.\" \\n(e) Policy  No. PS-AIR-100-2003-09-12-03-ResMIl,  \"Restricted  Category/Military \\nSurplus Program Management,\" dated September 12,  2003. \\nb. Surplus Military Engines for Normal Category Aircraft. Section 21.27 allows type \\ncertification of surplus aircraft from the U.S. military, including the installed engine(s), under \\nnormal category. The engine does not receive its own TC, but it must be shown to have \\nsubstantially the same level of airworthiness as would be provided by part 33 (see §  21.27(c)). \\nThe references listed below discuss general requirements for airworthiness certification and \\nprovide guidance in making the required determination of engine airworthiness: \\n(1) Order  8110.4  et seq., \"Type Certification.\" \\n(2) AC 20-62E, \"Eligibility, Quality, and Identification of Aeronautical Replacement \\nParts.\" \\n(3) AC 20-142, \"Eligibility and Evaluation of  U.S.  Military Surplus Flight Safety Critical \\nAircraft Parts, Engines, and Propellers.\" \\nc. Surplus Military Engine Parts for Civil Engines. Certain  U.S.  military engine parts may \\nhave potential for civil use. Parts from dual-use engines may be installed in both restricted and \\nnormal category aircraft. Parts unique to the U.S. military may also be installed in restricted category aircraft. The references below outline methods by which military-surplus parts might be \\ninstalled in civil engines: \\n(1) AC 20-142, \"Eligibility and Evaluation of\\n U.S.  Military Surplus Flight Safety Critical \\nAircraft Parts, Engines, and Propellers.\" \\n(2) AC 20-62E, \"Eligibility, Quality, and Identification of Aeronautical Replacement \\nParts.\" \\nd. Engine Conversion from Military to Civil Model. Surplus U.S. military engines with an \\nFAA TC may be eligible for conversion from their military model to a civilian counterpart model \\nthat also has an FAA TC. These conversions are typically accomplished using approved data \\nfound in manufacturer service documents. Those documents also provide the instructions \\nnecessary to make the conversion. However, other conversion methods may be possible. \\n6/25/13  AC 33-2C \\ne. New Engine Certification and Production Using Military Surplus Parts. U.S. military \\nsurplus parts (new or used), which were originally produced under an FAA-approved quality \\nsystem (for example, production certificate), may be used for new engine production under a TC \\nand a production certificate (PC). This is not a maintenance activity; it is new production. \\nf. Importing Surplus Foreign Military Engines and Parts. Used foreign military engines may \\nalso be eligible for restricted category under § 21.25(a)(2) if: \\n(1) The U.S. military procured and accepted the engine for their operational use, and \\n(2) The U.S. military excessed the engine for public sale. \\nImported surplus or foreign military engines that do not meet these requirements are not eligible for restricted category under § 21.25. \\ng. Engine Parts (New or Used) From Non-Aviation Sources. Derivatives of civil aircraft \\nengines are sometimes used in marine and industrial applications. Parts for these derivative \\nengines may carry the same engine TC holder part numbers as aircraft engines. It is \\nrecommended that spare parts be procured from commercial aviation sources, as parts procured \\nfrom non-aviation sources may not be eligible for installation in aircraft engines. \\n8. Data Plates. The applicant must comply with part 45, part and product marking and \\nidentification requirements. For engines, a fireproof data or identification plate is required per \\n§\\n 45.11.  The data plate must contain, at a minimum, the information noted in §  45.13.  For \\nexample, it must include the exact model name as specified in the TC and TCDS [refer to \\n§ 45.13(a)(2)]. \\na. Optional Information. Optional information may be inscribed on the data plate at the \\ndiscretion of the applicant. However, optional information should only be added if the information does not conflict with § 45.13 requirements, and if it\\'s placed in a field separate \\nfrom the engine model designation. For example, a TC holder may wish to specify an engine configuration or aircraft installation for a certain engine model/serial number combination. This \\ncould be useful for managing certain type design requirements (e.g., aircraft-specific data entry \\nplug) or fleet-management issues (e.g., life limited part tracking). The designator may be \\ninscribed on the data plate, appearing in a separate field from the model designation. \\nb. Fireproof Requirement. Part 45 requires that a data plate be  fireproof.  An acceptable \\nmethod of compliance is to apply a 2000 Fahrenheit flame over the entirety of the test piece for \\n15 minutes. The data plate must be readable after the test. See § 33.17 and AC 33.17-1 for related \\ninformation concerning fire testing of engine components. \\nc. Mounting the Data Plate. The data plate must be located in an accessible place on the \\nengine where it is easily viewed, will not likely be defaced or dislodged during normal operation \\nor maintenance, and will not be lost or destroyed in an accident. Additional information about \\ncompliance with part 45 is contained in AC  43-17,  \"Methods, Techniques and Practices \\n6/25/13  AC 33-2C \\nAcceptable to the Administrator Governing the Installation, Removal or Change of Identification \\nData and Identification Plates.\" \\n9. Part 33 Guidance Material. This paragraph contains guidance for selected sections of \\npart 33. \\na. Section  33.19,  Durability. Section  33.19(a)  requires that the engine be designed and \\nconstructed to minimize the development of an unsafe condition between overhaul periods, and \\nthat the compressor and turbine rotor containment case structures be designed to contain the \\ndamage from a rotor blade failure. The containment structures must retain this capability \\nthroughout their service lives, as maintained in accordance with the ICA. So, §  33.19  provides a \\ngeneral safety standard for engines between \"overhaul\" periods, and for rotor blade containment \\nand propeller pitch controls. \\n(1) References: \\n(a) AC 33-4, \"Design Considerations Concerning the Use of Titanium in Aircraft \\nTurbine Engines.\" \\n(b) AC 33-5, \"Turbine Engine Rotor Blade  Containment/Durability.\" \\nb. Section  33.21,  Engine Cooling. This section addresses operating fluid, external engine \\nsurface, component operating temperature, secondary bleed air system, as well as other related \\ncooling considerations, such as internal flow-path cooling of turbochargers, rotors, spacers, \\nnozzles, combustors, cases, etc. The safe operation of  all critical structural components is of \\nutmost importance. Applicants should ensure that a stable engine operating environment is \\nmaintained, thereby safeguarding engine component\\'s integrity throughout their design life \\nand/or  time to inspection, as appropriate. \\n(1) References: None. \\nc. Section  33.23,  Engine Mounting Attachments and Structure. This section requires \\nthe applicant to specify the maximum allowable limit and ultimate loads for engine mounting attachments and related engine structure. Methods for determining and \\nsubstantiating these values are described below. \\n(1) Limit loads are the maximum static and dynamic operational loads expected to occur \\nin service. There are several sources of mount loading that need to be considered when \\ncalculating the overall limit loads imposed upon the engine attachment mount structure. These include static loads, operating engine maximum reactive torque loads, gyroscopic loads, \\nmaximum ground and flight maneuver loads, and gust loads. Ultimate load capability is specified \\nby the applicant, and is generally related to certain engine failure cases (e.g., fan blade or main \\nrotor support failure) or emergency aircraft maneuvers. The engine applicant should coordinate \\nwith the installer to determine expected loads on the engine mount structure. \\n(2) Rig and component level testing and validated analysis are acceptable methods for \\n6/25/13  AC33-2C \\ndemonstrating load capability under §  33.23. \\n(3) Engine mounting attachments and structure designs should consider low cycle fatigue \\n(e.g., the applicability of  § 33.70), corrosion, and other deterioration effects expected during the \\ndesign life of the engine. \\n(4) References: None. \\nd. Section 33.25, Accessory Attachments. This section requires that engine accessory \\ndrives and their mount pads permit proper engine operation at maximum loads; prevent \\ncontamination and excessive loss of  oil; and permit inspection, adjustment, and removal of \\naccessories. Some engine accessory drives are protected from potential failure conditions \\n(such as accessory seizure) by drive shaft shear features. In this case, applicants must show \\nthat the shear feature will not fail under all normal operating load conditions. Applicants \\nshould also show that the shear section will not otherwise result in damage or hazard to the \\nengine or aircraft installation. \\n(1) References: None. \\ne. Section 33.29, Instrument Connection. This section describes instrumentation \\nrequirements. In § 33.29(b), \"turbojet\" includes both turbofan and open rotor engine types. \\nThe installation instructions required by § 33.5 should contain all instrumentation information needed by the installer. \\n(1) References: \\n(a) AC\\n 3 3-7A,  \"Guidance for  30-Second  and 2-Minute One-Engine-Inoperative  (OEI) \\nRatings for Rotorcraft Turbine Engines.\" \\n(b) AC  33.28-1,  \"Compliance Criteria for 14 CFR § 33.28, Aircraft Engines, Electrical \\nand Electronic Engine Control Systems.\" \\nf. Section 33.66, Bleed Air System. The need to restrict bleed airflow should either be \\nincorporated in the engine type design, such as by an orifice, or otherwise specified in the engine \\ninstallation instructions and engine TCDS. \\n(1) References: None. \\ng. Section  33.67,  Fuel System. This section requires that the engine fuel system be \\ndesigned and constructed to operate satisfactorily under all applicable operating conditions. \\nFor §  33.67(b)(5)  compliance, one-half the average predicted mission flight time has been \\nconsidered acceptable for the demonstration time period. Test demonstrations should be conducted at fuel flows most critical to the mission. We recommend Table X of Military \\nSpecification MIL-E-5007E (AS), \"Engines, Aircraft, Turbojet and Turbofan, General Specification For, Table X, Typical Fuel Contaminants,\" dated September 1,\\n 1983,  for \\nexamples of typical fuel contaminants, particle sizes, and quantities to be considered. \\n6/25/13  AC 33-2C \\n(1) Reference: Military Specification MIL-E-5007E(AS), \"Engines, Aircraft, Turbojet and \\nTurbofan, General Specification For, Table X, Typical Fuel Contaminants,\" dated September 1, \\n1983. \\nh. Section 33.69, Ignition System. The engine installation instructions should define the \\ncharacteristics and interface requirements for all sources of electrical power required by the \\nengine ignition system for reliable operation. \\n(1) Reference: Policy  No. PS-ANE100-2001-1998-33.69-R1, \"Policy for Evaluating \\nIgnitions System Requirements, 14 CFR 33.69,\" dated February 26, 2001. \\ni. Section  33.84,  Engine Overtorque Test. This section applies to turboshaft and \\nturbopropeller type engines, which incorporate a free power turbine. This requirement allows the \\napplicant to establish a maximum overtorque operating limit as follows: \\n(1) The maximum overtorque limit is approved for use for up to 20 seconds maximum \\nduration, and for all conditions except operation at the  3 0-second/2-minute  OEI  rating (see \\nreference below for limit definition). \\n(2) This limit addresses a main rotor droop condition primarily affecting turboshaft \\nengines with free power turbines; however, certain turbo propeller installations may exhibit the \\nsame phenomena. An overtorque condition may also occur following an in-flight loss of power. \\nFor example, an engine failure on a multi-engine rotorcraft might reduce available power by  half, \\nresulting in an instantaneous decrease in scheduled main rotor speed. As the main rotor control \\nsystem corrects this droop by commanding a speed increase, and with additional collective \\nnormally applied by the pilot to maintain flight path, power demand at the main rotor increases \\nsharply. It is due to this increased power demand that an overtorque condition may occur. Torque \\nproduced while the operating engine accelerates the main rotor back to its normal operating \\nspeed can cause high stress in the engine power transmission components. \\n(3) The power or torque-transmitting components in a free turbine engine are typically the \\nturbine blades, disks, shafts, and gears (if configured with a gearbox). Torque has varying effects \\non the stress levels of these components. The following situations generally apply when \\nanalyzing these power transmission components: \\n(a) Turbine blades and disks are dominated by centrifugal loads, with overall strength \\nbeing affected by core gas temperature. The torque produced by core gas loads has only a minor \\neffect with regard to the total stress on turbines and blades. \\n(b) The stress levels of shafts and gears are typically dominated by the amount of \\ntorque they are transmitting. Shafts and gears are minimally affected by core gas temperatures. \\n(4) Typically, the time spent at maximum steady-state speed and temperature limits during \\nthe endurance test required by § 33.87, results in a more severe demonstration of stress and \\ndurability than would occur during a maximum overtorque event. This data can sometimes be \\n6/25/13  AC 33-2C \\nused to support compliance with § 33.84(b)(4). Therefore, the requirement to run the overtorque \\ntest at maximum steady-state temperature may be adjusted if you obtain FAA approval. \\n(5) Reference: 14  CFR  part 1, § 1.1, General Definitions (Maximum engine overtorque). \\nj . Section  33.88.  Engine Overtemperature Test. This test demonstrates a minimum \\novertemperature capability for the engine model. \\n(1) This rule requires a test demonstration on a complete engine. The test vehicle \\nand facility should be set up to minimize any mismatch of internal flow capacities of \\ncomponents and systems. \\n(2) For § 33.88(a) compliance, the maximum permissible  rpm and indicated turbine gas \\ntemperature refer to the highest approved steady-state values, which are specified in the engine \\nTCDS.  This includes limits associated with all ratings, including OEI ratings of  2 ^-minute \\nduration or greater. \\n(3) Section 33.88(b) contains additional test requirements for engines with a \\n30-second  OEI and 2-minute OEI rating. \\n(4) The test overlimit values (e.g., 75 °F / 35 °F) must be applied at the turbine inlet \\nstation (typically called T4), not the type design operating limit measurement station (e.g., EGT \\nor ITT). It remains, however, that the overtemperature test value is a function of the maximum \\nsteady-state operating temperature limit (at the type design measurement location). To determine \\nthe proper overtemperature test value, determine the turbine inlet (T4) temperature associated with the maximum steady-state limit value (at the type design measurement location). Add the \\noverlimit value to this turbine inlet temperature (T4) to obtain the overtemperature test value for indicated turbine gas value. \\n(5) Post-test acceptance criteria for § 33.88(a) testing requires that the engine turbine \\nassembly and support structure be within serviceable limits. Applicable components include, but are not limited to, blades, discs, drums, spacers, shafts, seals, stators, nozzles, and support \\nstructure. Serviceable limits are as specified in the ICA, as required by § 33.4. Post-test \\nacceptance criteria for § 33.88(b) testing requires the turbine assembly to maintain its integrity at \\nthe end of the test. Maintaining integrity means that no imminent failure conditions are evident, \\nand that the engine can continue to operate for continued safe flight and landing after the event. \\n(6) References: \\n(a) AC 33-3, \"Turbine and Compressor Rotors Type Certification Substantiation \\nProcedures.\" \\n(b) Policy\\n No. PS-ANE100-1988-00007, \"Clarification Guidance on Implementation \\nof FAR Section 33.88 Overtemperature Test,\" dated December 22, 1988. \\n(c) Policy  No. PS-ANE100-1997-00004,  \"Engine Overtemperature Test; Governing \\n6/25/13  AC 33-2C \\nTemperature Location,\" dated October 7,  1997. \\nk. Section 33.89, Operation Test. The operations test must include all testing found \\nnecessary by the FAA to demonstrate safe operating characteristics throughout the \\nspecified operating envelope. Engine and component testing required for other part  33 \\nsections may be used to show compliance to this section. The operations test should \\ninclude tests to: \\n(1) Demonstrate start characteristics throughout the starting envelope. \\n(2) Demonstrate engine operation throughout the temperature and altitude envelopes. \\n(3) Demonstrate the ability of the engine to operate without damaging surge or stall (see \\n§ 33.65). \\n(4) Show adequate operational margins for variations in fuel schedule, variable geometry \\nschedules, and  installation/environmental  effects. \\n(5) Demonstrate the ignition system design duty cycle. \\n(6) Demonstrate operation of the propeller parking brake (if equipped). \\n(7) References: None. \\n1. Section 33.95, Engine-Propeller Systems Tests. This test exercises the complete \\nengine relative to propeller pitch and speed control, feathering, negative torque sensing, \\nand decouplers. \\n(1) Compliance with this section is achieved by successfully completing the applicable \\ntests and test cycles listed in § 33.95, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), and (d). Tests may be performed on \\nan engine test stand, a test rig (such as a modified dynamometer rig or a propeller gearbox component test rig), or during flight test. \\n(2) Paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section address the feathering and reversing cycle tests. \\nThey are typically conducted with a propeller on an engine test stand in conjunction with other \\ntests,  such as the engine endurance test. Alternately they may be conducted on an aircraft in \\nconjunction with flight tests. \\n(3) Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section address the negative torque and thrust tests. The \\ndecoupling tests required by paragraph (c) are typically run on an aircraft during flight or on a \\ntest rig. The reason for this is the engine system requires a negative torque or thrust-load input \\nfrom the propeller. Negative torque is achieved in-flight with a windmilling propeller. On a test rig, a device drives the propeller shaft to achieve negative torque. \\n(4) When testing on a rig, the propeller should be represented in a manner that directly \\nmatches its polar moment of inertia. A flywheel or similar device is appropriate to this purpose. \\n6/25/13 AC 33-2C \\nFailure to properly match the design ofthe \"representative propeller\" to the propeller may cause \\ninadvertent decoupling or torque sensing to occur during undesired operating conditions, such as \\nduring engine shutdown or other transients. \\n(5) When conducting any ofthese tests , specialized instrumentation will generally be \\nneeded to detect and record the operation ofthe systems being tested. \\n(6) Successfu l completion ofthe tests means that the engine-actuated propeller control \\nfunctions as intended , without detrimen tal effect on either the engine or the propeller. \\n(7) References: None. \\nm.

Powder metal \\nmanufacturing introduces inherent anomalies into the material, usually in the form of inclusions or pores, which are generally microscopic. During fatigue loading, cracks can nucleate from these anomalies.  Therefore, when determining the approved life of a \\nrotating part, the applicant should identify the possibility of an anomaly occurring at a highly stressed location and nucleating a fatigue crack. \\n5.2 While assessments are made for the rare occurrence of a melt anomaly in the traditional \\ncast and wrought material, the likelihood of an occurrence is so low that establishing the probability of the presence of such an anomaly is based on a combination of the following inspections.  \\n•In-service inspections (cracking or fractures);\\n•Manufacturer inspections; and\\n•Supplier inspections.\\nBy contrast, the inherent nature of the inclusions and porosity in powder metal is such that a more systematic approach can be taken, as discussed in this AC.  The applicant \\nshould consider the elements of a test program that are required to establish the capability of the material, recognizing that while an extreme size anomaly can occur in production quantities, it is unlikely it will be present in the limited volume of material tested.  A method for determining the fatigue capability of powder material is developed \\nfrom these tests, which can be used to demonstrate the integrity of parts.  \\n6 INTRODUCTION. \\n6.1 Life Management Activities. \\n6.1.1 Since the failure of an engine life -limited part is likely to result in a hazardous  engine \\neffect, as defined in §  33.75(g)(2) and (3), the applicant must meet specific integrity \\nrequirements by performing a series of life management activities (see §  33.70(a), (b), \\nand (c)). \\n6.1.2 Section 33.70 requires the applicant to establish the integrity of each engine life- limited \\npart by developing and implementing an engineering plan, a manufacturing plan, and a service management plan.  These three plans form a closed -loop system that links the \\nassum ptions made in the engineering plan to the manufacture of the part and finally to \\nthe in -service maintenance.  Applicants should ensure that the engineering, \\nmanufacturing, and service management plans function as an integrated system, and recognize that the actions in one area could affect the entire system.  AC 33.70-1 \\nprovides additional information on these three plans. \\n4 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n6.2 Int\\nro\\nduction of Nickel Powder . \\nNickel powder materials have been introduced to allow the use of highly alloyed \\nmaterials that would be difficult, if not impossible, to produce through a conventional melt route due to segregation (the non- uniform distribution of alloying elements in the \\nforging).  Instead, with nickel powder materials, small particles of the material are \\nproduced, which cool so quickly that levels of segregation are microscopic, producing a \\nconsistent alloy composition. The powder particles are then consolidated into a single monolithic piece of material. \\n6.3 Inherent Inclusions and Porosity.  \\nThe methods for producing the particle s and consolidating the material introduce \\nanomalies, such as small inclusions and porosity (caused by trapped gas), both of which are inherent  to the process. While fatigue testing on components made of powder \\nmetallurgy will often fail from grain facet features, similar to conventional cast and wrought alloys, there will also be occasional failures nucleating f rom the inherent \\ninclusions or porosity. \\n6.3.1 When establishing the fatigue life and safe operation for such a component, the applicant should consider the possibility of fatigue fracture from both grain facets and anomalies such as inclusions and pores that cannot be found during nondestructive inspections (see F igure 1).  The NASA/CR-2011-216977 report also provides a \\nthorough discussion of issues in lifing powder alloys (see paragraph 3.3 of this AC). \\nFigure 1. L\\nifing Assessments Performed on Powder Nickel Materials  \\n5 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n7 P\\nROCESS\\nING OF POWDER MATERIALS.  \\n7.1 Powder Metal in the Molten State . \\nA powder alloy is produced from the molten state.  After the alloy is melted to the \\ndesired chemical composition, the liquid metal is poured through a nozzle and atomized \\ninto a fine spray of droplets.  These droplets quickly solidify and cool in a collection \\nvessel.  The particles are then passed through a sequence of sieves to eliminate the \\nlarger particles, resulting in a uniform size distribution of powder. \\n7.2 Inclusion Creation.  \\nInclusions in the microstructure of powder metallurgy components are typically small pieces of ceramic that have spalled from the interior surfaces of crucibles, nozzles , and \\nother ceramic components used in the metal melting and pouring processes. Ceramic spalling is caused by the stresses of thermal cycling and erosive molten metal flow. Consequently, small particles of ceramic lining material released are collected with solidified powder metal.  These inclusions are generally tiny, perhaps measured in \\nmicrons, but occasionally larger inclusions can get through the sieve. These inclusion particles may be large r in one dimension than the sieve gauge and can be acicular, \\nallowing them to pass through the sieve. Inclusion particles larger than the sieve dimensions are found on rare occasions, similar to those of anomalies in conventional cast and wrought materials . These larger (rogue) inclusions often appear as unique \\nindividual distributions relative to the inclusion size, which can still be present after the sieving process.  Applicants should evaluate the potential effects the rogue inclusions \\nmay have on component life.  \\n7.3 Hot Compaction Methods and Heat Treatment.  \\nThe consolidation of powder materials is achieved by hot compaction methods at high temperature\\ns and pressures.  This consolidation results in plastic flow and diffusion, \\nbonding the particles and produci ng a material structure suitable for subsequent \\nprocessing. The consolidated material may then be subjected to additional hot deformation by shearing the compact through a die to produce an extrusion or through tightly controlled radial forging processes. This process will produce a billet followed \\nby isothermal forging to a shape that is close to the final component. The deformation breaks up and elongates the ceramic inclusions and porosity present.  The material may \\nalso be used in an as- compacted form (such as post- Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP)) to \\nmanufacture components. \\n7.4 Final Machining . \\nAfter heat tre\\natment, the forging or as -compacted form is then machined to remove the \\nsurface layers through a series of shapes, allowing inspection before the component is \\nmachined to the required profile for engine use.  \\n6 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n7.5 Inspect\\nio\\nn Techniques.  \\n7.5.1 Ultrasonic Inspection . \\nUltrasonic inspection can usually achieve a high standard  of detectability  because the  \\noverall processing route of the material delivers a uniform small grain size with low \\nnoise levels.  Determining the sequence of inspection relative to heat treatment and the \\ndirection of scan(s) are reasonable considerations when developing the Manufacturing \\nPlan.  \\n7.5.2 Etch and Fluorescent Penetrant Inspections. \\nEtch and fluorescent penetrant inspections are routinely applied to the machined \\ncomponent to check the conformity of microstructure and to confirm the absence of \\ncracks or crack -like anomalies on the surface.  Because etching can adversely affect the \\nintegrity of the finished material surface at smooth or notched features, the applicant should understand and include the impact of etching practices into its fatigue \\nmanagement program. Adverse effects of etching c an be eliminated by subsequent shot \\npeening of machined and etched surfaces.  \\n7.6 Traceability of Powder. \\nThe applicant should also ensure that the powder produced is traceable, and of a \\nconsistent high quality. T his is a pre requisite for a reliable lifing system for powder \\nalloys. \\n8 DEVELOPING THE LIFING SYSTEM . \\n8.1 Life System Approval. \\n8.1.1 For an applicant to use a life system, the FAA must first approve the e ngineering  plan \\nrequired by § 33.70. The applicant should develop and submit a formal written lifing system plan to the FAA for approval. The plan should identify the techniques and controls used to establish and maintain the life- limits.  Section 33.70 states, “ By a \\nprocedure approved by the FAA, operating limitations must be established which specify the maximum a llowable number of flight cycles for each engine life -limited \\npart.” Therefore, t he applicant must submit all proposed life system changes to the FAA \\nfor approval , and the FAA must approve all life system changes before use.  See AC \\n33.70-1 for additional information.  \\n8.2 Certification Process Overview . \\n8.2.1 Methodology. \\nThe first step in developing a lifing system is to characterize the different mechanisms of crack  initiation (or nucleation) in the material, which can typically be from\\n— \\n•Grain facets (similar nucleation mechanism to conventional alloys); or\\n•Anomalies, such as inclusions (both inherent and rogue inclusions) and porosityresulting from inert gas trapped in the powder.\\n7 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n8.2.2 Th\\ne charac\\nterization of the active crack nucleation mechanisms can only be done by \\nfractographic examination of the failure surfaces.  This examination should include a \\nsufficient number of fatigue specimens tested at component -representative strains and \\ntemperatures.  \\n8.2.3 The declarable component life will be the lowest re sult from separate life assessments \\nperformed for the mechanisms, as shown in figure 1. \\n8.2.4 Crack Nucleation Factors.  \\n8.2.4.1 For each nucleation mechanism, the applicant should examine the \\nsignificant parameters driving the LCF life.  Cycle- related parameters may \\ninclude: \\n•Applied stress or strain levels, their degree of multiaxiality, and any\\nnon-linear deformation from plasticity and/or creep; and\\n•Cycle temperature and the applied component loads. It would beexpected that nucleation of a propagating crack will depend on thepeak stress.  However, if the peak temperature occurs simultaneously\\nor at some other point in the engine cycle, this may influence cycletemperature and applied component load. This will certainly influencethe crack propagation phase after crack n ucleation.\\n8.2.4.2 For nucleation from grain facets, the significant parameters are usually identical to those of a conventional cast and wrought alloy with the same chemistry.  Therefore, applicants may apply the same type of lifing \\nmodels. \\n8.2.4.3 In addition to the cycle- related factors described above, the fatigue \\nbehavior of anomalies may also depend on the following variables: \\n•Size of the anomaly, including its aspect ratios and orientation;\\n•Composition of the anomaly and its effect, if any, on the substrate\\nmaterial;\\n•Proximity of the anomaly to a surface of the component because thisaffects the balance of the stresses in the microstructure around theanomaly and how easily it can incubate a propagating crack; and\\n•Surface treatment of the component because of  the shot peening\\nprocess.  For example, shot peening will distort the microstructure at a\\nsurface or very near surface anomaly, and the residual stresses mayaffect potential crack nucleation and propagation.\\n8 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n8.2.4.4 The si\\nmplest approach to determine the fatigue life of the part would be to \\ntreat all anomalies as initial cracks of a size equal to the projected area \\nnormal to the largest principal tensile stress.  In practice, especially for \\nsmaller anomalies, there is a significant life before the anomaly behaves and/or can be modeled like a propagating crack (this life is often referred to as the nucleation life).  The smallest inclusions will probably never \\nnucleate a propagating crack in a large volume of parts, such as engine rotating components. \\n8.2.5 Probabilistic As sessment.  \\n8.2.5.1 A probabilistic component lifing model is likely to be the most appropriate for fatigue failures originating from anomalies such as inclusions and porosity, demonstrating that the probability of a fracture from an extreme size of anomaly present in a highly stressed portion of a component is \\nacceptably low.  This evaluation follows the same lines as an assessment \\nfor melt anomalies in conventional cast and wrought materials.  Figure 2 \\nshows a sample probabilistic assessment method.  \\nFigure 2. P\\nrobabilistic Assessment Method for Fracture from Inclusions \\n8.2.5.2 The probabilistic model will be based on a two-stage representation of fatigue life consist ing of the following key inputs\\n— \\n•Crack propagation life as a function of the engine cycle varia bles and\\nconsidering, if near surface, residual stresses from machining and/o r\\nsurface treatment are present;\\n9 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n•Nucleation life as a function of size and type of anomaly, and\\nproximity to a surface, and as a function of cycle and materialvariables, such as applied strain or stress, temperature (peak and itsphasing with the applied loads), loading multiaxiality, and inelastic(creep and plastic)  strain levels, if applicable; and\\n•Size\\n and frequency distribution of the powder material anomal ies.\\n8.2.5.3 Methods for determining the anomaly distributions and nucleation lives are discussed in paragraphs 9 and 10. Although these paragraphs focus on inclusions, the applicant may use the same principles to assess the risk of porosity- related failure with some minor differences.  \\n9 CHARACTERIZING THE INCLUSION SIZE DISTRIBUTION IN POWDER MATERIALS.  \\n9.1 Establishing Inclusion Size . \\n9.1.1 All powder materials will be characterized using the same mechanical and physical measurements used for c onventional cast and wrought materials. In addition, it is \\nnecessary to extract data to make a prediction of the largest size of inclusion that could occur in a given volume of material. Predicting the largest size is based on measuring \\ninclusions above a detectable limit in known volumes of material.  If the number of \\ninclusions found using a particular inspection process is known and a size distribution is fitted to those found, then it is relatively simple to predict the likelihood of finding a large incl usion in any volume of material.  Nevertheless, this is complicated , because\\n— \\n•There is a lower detectable limit below which inclusions may simply be missed.\\nThis may be because 1) the inclusion size is small, in which case the inclusion is\\nunlikely to be life limiting; or 2) the shape and orientation of the inclusion is suchthat the area presented to the inspection plane is small, in which case the inclusioncould be life limiting.  Consequently, the applicant should define the inspection\\nplans to maximize i nspection capability, accounting for the deformation of the\\nmaterial during forging.  The applicant should also ensure that the inspection plan\\nidentifies the inspection limits when fitting the anomaly rate, size, and orientationdistributions.\\n•Sieving is designed to remove larger inclusions, but long acicular inclusions with a\\nlower cross -sectional area may still pass through.  The size distribution at powder\\ncreation may be smooth, but will become less populated at large sizes due to\\nsieving.\\n9.1.2 It is not clea r what upper limit to the inclusion size should be used, especially when \\nrogue inclusion sizes may be present. Methods for detecting and measuring the sizes of rogue anomalies will be required to account for them in the lifing process.  \\n10 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n9.2 Inclusi\\non Characterization Methods \\n9.2.1 Given the various complications in gathering inclusion distribution information, the \\napplicant should include several processing methods for detecting and measuring inclusion sizes and orientations as provided below. \\n9.2.1.1 Fractographic examination of powder material . Applicants would \\nperform metallographic examination of billet or forged material, which would show any effects of forging on inclusions. This method is desirable \\nsince inclusions may deform and elongate during forging. Due t o the effort \\nrequired to section and polish material, only small volumes of material can be inspected using this approach. Therefore, there is a degree of extrapolation up to a volume representative of all highly stressed material in production quantities of components. \\n9.2.1.2 Large bar tensile \\n tests.  Applicants should remember that it is assumed \\nthe bar will fail at the largest inclusion.  By testing enough large tensile \\nspecimens, each with a known volume at the ultimate stress, applicants can measure the largest  inclusion on the fracture surface.  This also \\nassumes the critical dimension is normal to the direction of the tensile stress.  This method can examine a relatively large total volume of \\nmaterial, comparable to a small number of engine disks. The specimens are usually cut from billet material, but may be taken from forgings.  The \\nonly information obtained from these tests is the size of the largest inclusion in each volume. Gumbel statistics are useful in deriving the underlying rate and size di stribution for forward extrapolation up to larger \\nvolumes. \\n9.2.1.3 Large specimen fatigue tests.  A possibility is to systematically test \\nfatigue of powder alloys on larger specimens than typically used for conventional alloys. Applicants would extract large specim ens from \\nforgings and choose their size based on forging size and fatigue test machine capability.  In this manner, the volume of material tested in \\nfatigue would increase, as would the probability of failure from a large inclusion. When the specimen fails from an inclusion, this inclusion is obviously the most detrimental for fatigue resistance in the tested volume.  \\nThis failure can be related to the size of the inclusion plus scatter coming from its interaction with the local microstructural environment.  By \\nmeasuring the size of the inclusion at the fracture origin on each specimen and testing enough large specimens, the underlying rate and size distribution of inclusions can be derived using similar techniques as described for large bar tensile tests.  Thes e large specimen fatigue test \\nresults can also be used to characterize the nucleation life from inclusions.  \\n11 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n9.2.1.4 Hea\\nvy liquid separation.  By passing the basic powder through a liquid \\nwith a density between those of the alloy and the inclusions, the inclusion \\nparticles will float while the alloy will sink.  This examines the material \\nbefore consolidation and forging. A model is required that relates the sizes of particles found to what will be missed and, therefore, could remain in the forged component. However, the examination and measurement of the particles is relatively easy and can include all three dimensions, which is not easily achieved by the other methods. Depending on local health and environmental regulations, the use of heavy liquid separation may be restricted due to the toxicity of the material necessary to reach an \\nintermediate density between the ceramic inclusions and the nickel alloy powder. Alternative techniques are also available, such as water separation. Further aspects of heavy liquid separation are discussed by Roth et al. (see paragraph 3.3 of this AC). \\n9.2.1.5 Acid digestion.  Applicants may accomplish this method by using an acid \\nto remove metallic material while the inclusions are not attacked and left as remnant particles at the end of the process.  Tungsten-bearing alloys, \\nhowever, have proven difficult to evaluate by this technique due to the formation of tungstic acid and its subsequent effect on laboratory hardware.  \\n9.2.1.6 Cut-up characterization of ultrasonic indications.  Applicants would \\nperform 2D and 3D characterization of the anomalies detected by the ultrasonic inspection. This method also gathers information relative to porosity and other issues, such as proximity of anomalies and the rogue size population. \\nThe applicant should use more than one of the above approaches for both the initial determination of the inclusion size distribution and the continued monitoring of the powder production process to confirm that the initial size distribution remains appropriate for lifing throughout the life of the product. \\n10 FATIGUE TEST STRATEGY TO CHARACTERIZE THE LIFE FROM INCLUSIONS IN POWDER MATERIALS.  \\n10.1 Sample Strategies for Determining the Life.  \\nFatigue testing small specimens of material can give rise to widely varying results.  If \\nthe tested volume is free  of inclusions, the behavior will appear significantly better than \\nwhen a large inclusion is present. As the volume under high- stress increases, it becomes \\nmore likely that fracture will nucleate at an  inclusion, but even large disks may not \\nalways fractur e from inclusions.  To establish the fatigue implications of inclusions, the \\ntesting approach should consider how a sufficient number of failures could  be \\ngenerated to demonstrate that the service operation of powder materials can avoid fracture.  \\n12 \\n8/15/23 AC 33.70-4 \\n10.1.1 Stra\\ntegy 1- Large Volume s of Material.  \\nFatigue testing of large volumes of material such that a significant number of fractures \\nfrom inclusions are generated would be the simplest approach.  However, in practice, \\nthis would be very expensive since,  as noted above, even large disks do not always \\nfracture from inclusions.  Tests should also be conducted at a wide range of \\ntemperatures and load levels to ensure that the material behavior has been characterized appropriately through the full- service usag e envelope. \\n10.1.2 Strategy 2 - Seeded Material\\n . \\nFatigue testing of seeded material where artificial inclusions of a known size and rate are introduced at the powder stage is another approach.  The seeds should be \\nrepresentative of the actual inclusions in composi tion and behavior. Specimens and \\ncomponents manufactured from seeded material are much more likely to fail from the artificial seeds than through conventional LCF. This allows a fatigue model for the inclusions to be generated based on a relatively modest test program.  \\n10.2 Defining Equivalent Crack Size.  \\n10.2.1 Regardless of how the applicant performs the tests, the applicant should define an equivalent crack size that corresponds to the end of the nucleation phase of life and the start of crack growth.  The applicant could show equivalency in various ways, for \\nexample:  \\n•Engineering crack size (0.030” x .015” for surface cracks, but less easily defined forsub-surface cracks);\\n•The actual size of the anomaly from which the fatigue failure nucleated (determinedby fractography); or\\n•The actual size of the anomaly from which the fatigue failure nucleated, plus an\\nallowance for diffusion or other interaction between the anomaly and the\\nsurrounding material.\\n10.2.2 Determining the nucleation life is likely to involve back calculations  using fracture \\nmechanics of the number of cycles from either test piece, failure, or crack detection (of a known size) to the equivalent crack size at the end of the nucleation  life. \\n10.2.3 For crack nucleation from porosity, the applicant should show equivalenc y as described  \\nin paragraph 10.2.1. It may be possible to show that the size and frequency distribution for porosity can be determined directly from conventional specimens because pores are often more frequent than inclusions and have a lower scatter in size.  The applicant may \\nalso consider seeding studies, using methods such as atomizing powder at off-nominal conditions to generate porosity at higher rates than at the nominal conditions. The stress component (von Mises or worst principal, for example) that best describes crack nucleation needs to also be defined. \\nNote:  The stress component may be different for a pore, an inclusion, or a grain facet. \\n13 \\n8/15/23 \\n11 CALIBRATION AND VALIDATION OF THE PROBABILISTIC SYSTEM FOR \\nINCLUSIONS. AC 33.70-4 \\n11.1 As a probabilistic system integrates a significant number of parameters (related to the \\nsize distribution and\\n life model) that are often identified independently, applicants \\nshould verify that the probabilistic sy\\nstem produces sensible results once these are \\ncombined. As part of achieving this, the  inclusion size distribution may be slightly \\nadjusted in the domain that \\nis too small to be easily characterized experimentally. \\n11.2 The confirmation of the accuracy of the probabilistic system for inclusions can be made \\nusing fatigue test results from specimens or components made from unseeded material. \\nAlthough only a fractio\\nn will fracture from inclusions, applicants should ensure that \\nthese occurrences are sorted \\nto correlate the various probabilities that the probabilistic \\nsystem can calculate. For example,\\n applicants should consider the following: \\n •Conditional probabilities of failure from surface, sub-surface, and internal\\ninclusions;\\n •Probabilities of failure from inclusions within a given size interval; and\\n •The global failure probability distribution from inclusions as a function of cycles\\nat a given loading condition.\\n11.3 It is important that applicants run a test campaign to show the accuracy or at least the \\nconservatism of the probabilistic system. In addition to fatigue specimen tests, this \\nshould include tests that repres\\nent the behavior of components. Spin tests are useful in \\nsuch campaigns to provide informati on on how to account for component \\ncharacteristics, such as volume of material under stress, multiaxial loading, and residual \\nstresses. \\n11.4 The results from the component-representative tests should fall within the population of \\npredicted lives at the test conditions. \\n12 SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THIS AC. \\nIf you have suggestions for improving this AC, you may use the Advisory Circular \\nFeedback Form at the end of this AC. \\nDigitally signed byDANIEL J.

SECTION 33 .28 - GENERAL .\\n \\n1-1. Purpose . Section 33.28 regulates the general design and functioning of the ECS. It does not \\nreplace or supersede other regulations governing individual ECS components. Those \\ncomponents, such as alternators, sensors, and actuators, are also regulated under other part 33 sections, such as § 33.67 or 33.35 for the fuel system and § 33.91 or 33.53 for individual component tests. \\n1-2. Applicability . The guidance provided in this document is directed to engine manufacturers, \\nmodifiers, or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designated engineering representatives. \\nThis guidance should also assist the engine installer in understanding the differences between certification of the engine and the aircraft, and the assumptions made by the engine manufacturer concerning the engine- to-aircraft interface. \\nThis material is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a regulation. It describes acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulations. The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may present. Terms such as “should,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used. While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the relevant regulations. On the other hand, if we become convinced that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance. \\nApplicants for engines equipped with electronic engine control systems (EECS) may require \\nadditional guidance, especially with regard to the interface of these engines with the certification \\nof the aircraft or propeller or both. This AC discusses the tasks related to the engine, propeller, and aircraft certification processes generally, and indicates to a limited extent, how these tasks might be allocated among product manufacturers. This document applies to functions integrated into the EECS to the extent that these functions affect compliance with federal aviation regulations. \\nThis AC does not apply to conventional magnetos or electrically-powered actuators whose \\nactuation depends on pilot action through a dedicated electric circuit or electrical relays not controlled by the EECS. \\nThe material in this AC does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from existing regulatory requirements. \\n1-3.

Overview of this AC . This guidance focuses on electrical and electronic issues related to \\naircraft engine control systems. For EECSs, this AC also provides guidance for compliance with § 33.28 with special consideration to interfaces with the aircraft and the propeller. \\na. This AC gives guidance on the precautions to be taken when using electrical and \\nelectronic technology for engine control, protection, limiting and monitoring functions, and, where applicable, for integration of functions specific to the aircraft or to the propeller. In these latter cases, this AC applies to functions integrated into the EECS, but only to the extent that these functions affect compliance with part 33. Functions added to the EECS that are not required for compliance with part 33 but are required for installation compliance are documented in the engine installation manual. \\nb. This guidance primarily addresses the thrust and power functions of an EECS, since \\nthrust and power are the prime functions of the engine. Other functions that may be integrated into the system for control of engine operations, such as bleed air valve control, are also addressed in this AC. The principles outlined in this AC apply to the whole EC S. \\nc. Finally, introducing electronic engine control technology entails increased engine and \\naircraft control and control indicator integration, and an increased risk of failures affecting more than one engine. The applicant should, take special design precautions to minimize any adverse effects from any of the following: \\n(1) Insufficient protection from electromagnetic disturbance (lightning, internal or \\nexternal radiation effects), \\n(2) Insufficient integrity of the aircraft electrical power supply, \\n(3) Insufficient integrity of data supplied from the aircraft, \\n(4) Hidden design faults or discrepancies within the design of the propulsion system \\n(which are typically the result of incomplete or inaccurate requirements), or \\n(5) Omissions or errors in the system software or electronic hardware specification. \\n1-6. One of the objectives for the engine manufacturer in an engine certification program is to show that the certificated engine should be \"installable\" in a particular aircraft or aircraft type. Subpart E of parts 23, 25, 27, and 29 provides requirements for the installation of a certificated engine into an aircraft. The installed engine becomes a part of the powerplant system. These \\nregulations require that the powerplant system design meet all the requirements, procedures, \\nlimitations, and assumptions specified in the engine installation or operating instructions, the engine type certificate data sheet (TCDS), or the supplemental type certificate (STC). \\n1-7. Determining if an engine control system (ECS) complies with applicable aircraft \\ncertification regulations is done during aircraft certification. As part of the aircraft certification program, the FAA may also require flight-testing to fully evaluate engine performance and \\noperability characteristics for all operating modes (refer to § 939 of 14 CFR parts 23, 25, 27, and \\n2\\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n    \\n       \\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n        \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n    5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n29). However, when the aircraft application is unknown at the time of engine certification, the \\nengine manufacturer should make reasonable installation and operational assumptions for a \\ntarget application. The engine manufacturer details any installation limitations or operational \\nissues in the engine installation or operating instructions or both, or the TCDS. \\n1-8. When the applicant knows that aircraft components may contribute to or cause a failure \\ncondition that is evaluated in a part 33 safety analysis, the applicant should include the maximum \\nallowable contribution from those aircraft components in both the safety analysis and the installation limitations and instructions. Accounting for these components ensures the engine will \\nbe installable. \\n1-9. Appendix 1 provides applicants with references to the installation or operating instructions \\nor both as an aid in preparing complete installation and operating instructions. The installation or \\noperating instructions or both should include descriptive, interface, and operating data in enough \\ndetail to support aircraft certification. \\n1-10. Limitations specified in the engine installation or operati ng manuals should be consistent \\nwith those stated on the TCDS, amended TCDS, or STC, as applicable. This information is \\nintended to ensure that part 33 certification is not invalidated when the engine is installed on the aircraft. The applicant may also document these limitations in other manuals as long as they are referenced in the installation instructions or operating instructions or both. If the applicant uses \\nreference documents, then the applicant must make them available to the FAA and any potential installer. We recommend that the engine and aircraft manufacturers coordinate implementation of limitations or operational issues or both with the appropriate FAA certification offices. \\n3\\n \\n      \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n \\n       \\n   5/23/14\\t AC 33.28-3\\n \\nCHAPTER 2 . SECTION 33.28(a) - APPLICABILITY . \\n2-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(a) reads: \\n“(a) Applicability. These requirements are applicable to any system or device that is part of \\nengine type design, that controls, limits, or monitors engine operation, and is necessary for the continued airworthiness of the engine.” \\n2-2. Guidance: Applicability . \\na. Section 33.28 applies to all types of engine control systems, including any of the \\nfollowing ECS types: \\n(1)\\t Hydromechanical (except for those systems on reciprocating engines that are \\nadequately covered through § 33.35 and § 33.37), \\n(2) Hydromechanical with a limited authority electronic supervisor, \\n(3)\\t Single-channel full-authority electronic engine control with hydromechanical backup, \\n(4)\\t Dual-channel full-authority EEC without backup, \\n(5)\\t Three-channel full authority EEC (or 2 channe ls plus a voter), or \\n(6)\\t Any other ECS combination. \\nb. The ECS includes all equipment necessary for controlling the engine and ensuring safe \\noperation of the engine within its limits, as specified in § 33.28. Many components, including electronic control units, variable-geometry actuators, cables, wires, sensors, overspeed, over-torque, and over-temperature protection systems, fuel racks, and fuel metering units, are part of the ECS. Some engine monitoring systems are physically or functionally integrated with the ECS. These systems are considered part of the ECS if they: \\n(1)\\t Perform functions that affect engine safety, \\n(2)\\t Are used in the context of continued-operation, or \\n(3)\\t Are used in return- to-service decisions. \\nFor example, low-cycle fatigue counters for engine critical parts, as well as some trend monitors and devices that provide information for maintenance are part of the ECS. \\nSome components, such as a throttle position transducer, might be mounted in the aircraft and \\nare not part of the engine type design, but they are dedicated to the ECS and powered by it. Such elements are integral components of the ECS. \\n4\\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n2-3. Excluded elements . Some elements are excluded from the ECS. For example, fuel \\npumps, even though often engine-mounted and integrated with the fuel metering unit, are not \\npart of the ECS. They are part of the fuel delivery system. Demand-control pumps, however, are, or can be, a fuel controlling or limiting element of the system and are considered part of the ECS. Any other engine overspeed design features that are purely mechanical, such as rotor interference, or fuel cutoff methods through rotor axial movement, are not part of the ECS. For example, overspeed protection via blade shedding is purely mechanical protection, so blade shedding is not part of the ECS. \\n5\\n \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 3 . SECTION 33.28(b)(1) - VALIDATION . \\n3-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(b)(1) reads: \\n“(b) Validation. —(1) Functional Aspects. The applicant must substantiate by tests, analysis, or a \\ncombination thereof, that the engine control system performs the intended functions in a manner which: \\n(i ) Enables selected values of relevant control parameters to be maintained and the engine kept \\nwithin the approved operating limits over changing atmospheric conditions in the declared flight \\nenvelope; \\n(ii) Complies with the operability requirements of §§ 33.51, 33.65 and 33.73, as appropriate, \\nunder all likely system inputs and allowable engine power or thrust demands, unless it can be \\ndemonstrated that this is not required for non-dispatchable specific control modes in the intended application; \\n(iii) Allows modulation of engine power or thrust with adequate sensitivity over the declared \\nrange of engine operating conditions; and \\n(iv) Does not create unacceptable power or thrust oscillations.” \\n3-2. Guidance: Validation . \\na. The EECS can only perform its intended function if its software is successfully \\nintegrated with the control. Accordingly, the applicant should conduct testing to demonstrate \\nsuccessful integration of the EEC system software and the ECS. The applicant should perform this testing either on a complete engine or on a test rig that simulat es the ECS. \\nb. The applicant may use Aerospace Recommended Practice (ARP) 4754A, Guidelines/or \\nDevelopment of Civil Aircraft and Systems, as an acceptable method for establishing a \\ndevelopment assurance process. SAE ARP 4754A discusses the development of aircraft and systems taking into account the overall aircraft operating environment and functions. This includes validation of requirements and verification of the design implementation for certification and process assurance. Refer to AC20-174 for further understanding of the applicability of the ARP. \\nc. The specific exclusion for non-dispatchable modes in § 33.28(b)(1)(ii) is to create the \\nopportunity to maintain engine operation, even if limited, to support a “get home” configuration. \\nd. When evaluating adequate sensitivity in compliance with § 33.28(b)(1)(iii), the \\napplicant should consider two additional aspects of power or thrust modulation. First, the power or thrust setting regions should be void of any inversions. Second, flats, or “no response” \\nregions, in the power or thrust setting implementation, other than at the ends of range, are undesirable, except for positions that represent fixed power settings like maximum climb or cruise power. The applicant should also show that increasing the power lever settings in the \\n6\\n \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n   5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\ncockpit, results in the engine thrust or power output increases. The applicant should show that it \\nhas a continuous (no discontinuities) positive relationship (no inversions, such that increasing \\nforward throttle movement results in decreasing thrust or power), unless it shows that in special \\napplications, safety is enhanced by deviating from this relationship. Any deviation approved under Part 33 will also have to be approved at the aircraft installation (Part 23/25/27/29) level and therefore close coordination with the engine installer will be required to ensure the acceptability of any deviation granted. \\ne. For ECSs that have a governing mode for power turbine speed, § 33.28(b)(1)(iii) refers \\nto the ability to manage engine power to maintain power turbine speed within specified limits. \\nf. Chapter 6 further discusses power and thrust oscillations. \\n7\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 4. SECTION 33.28(b)(2) – ENVIRONMENTAL LIMITS . \\n4-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(b)(2) reads: \\n“(2) Environmental limits. The applicant must demonstrate, when complying with §§ 33.53 or \\n33.91, that the engine control system functionality will not be adversely affected by declared \\nenvironmental conditions, including electromagnetic interference (EMI), High Intensity Radiated Fields (HIRF), and lightning. The limits to which the system has been qualified must be documented in the engine installation instructions.” \\n4-2. Guidanc e: Environmental conditions include temperature, vibration, humidity, EMI, HIRF \\nand lightning. The environmental condition requirements are addressed under §§ 33.53 and \\n33.91. Although we do not specify the test limits , the conditions the applicant declares should \\nrepresent environments that engine installers and operators would encounter \\na. Environmental test procedures and test limits . AC 21-16G and SAE ARP5757 \\nprovide further guidance on showing compliance with §§ 33.53, 33.91, and 33.28. This AC recommends SAE ARP5757 in combination with RTCA/DO-160G for testing, but you may use MIL-STD-810 when the tests are equal to, or more rigorous than, those defined in RTCA/DO\\xad160G. As RTCA/DO-160 is very likely to be revised beyond revision G during the life of this AC, we encourage applicants to coordinate with the certification office before using a more \\nrecent revision of RTCA/DO-160. Unlike RTCA/DO-160G, however, we recommend performing a minimum of 10 temperature cycles for temperature variation tests. We also \\nrecommend applicants recognize that installers will use AC 20-136B and AC20-158 to show lightning and HIRF compliance, respectively, for the engine installation in the aircraft. \\nb. Radio frequency (RF) e mission test procedures and test limits. The procedures and \\nlimits in MIL-STD-461 or RTCA/DO-160G Section 21 are acceptable. \\nc. HIRF and lightning tests . Aircraft HIRF compliance regulations are found in \\n§§ 23.1308, 25.1317, 27.1317, and 29.1317. FAA guidance on HIRF compliance is found in AC 20-158. Aircraft lightning compliance regulations are found in §§ 23.1306, 25.1316, 27.1316, and 29.1316. FAA guidance on system lightning compliance is found in AC 20-136B. \\n(1) Test levels . Engine and aircraft applicants should select the HIRF and lightning test \\nlevels for the ECS. Applicants should select these test levels so that the EECS, when installed, meets aircraft certification regulations. If the applicant wants to claim any credit for HIRF and lightning testing, and if the applicant wants this claim shown on the TCDS or the IOI, the \\napplicant must have successfully completed the ECS HIRF and lightning tests. The engine \\napplicant should use the DO-160 section 20 and 22 categories and waveform sets defined in 4\\xad2d(1)(c) of this AC if HIRF and lightning test levels have not been determined for a specific aircraft engine installation. Hardware or software design changes implemented after initial environmental testing should be evaluated for their effects with respect to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), HIRF and lightning. \\n8\\n \\n      \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n    \\n     \\n   \\n \\n \\n       \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(a) Engine and aircraft manufacturers typically determine HIRF and lightning test \\nlevels through lightning transient and HIRF attenuation characterization tests. These tests are typically conducted on the aircraft with engines installed. If the HIRF and lightning test levels for the engine installation on a particular aircraft are not known at engine certification, the engine applicant may use the test levels in paragraphs 4-2d(1)(c) through 4-2d(1)(e) below. The aircraft applicant should confirm the compatibility of the engine test levels and the lightning transient characterization and HIRF attenuation tests with engines installed prior to aircraft certification. If these assumed test levels used for engine certification are not adequate for a particular aircraft \\ninstallation, the engine applicant may need to conduct additional ECS HIRF and lightning tests or analysis. \\n(b) The engine installation or operating instructions should specify any wire \\nshields, connectors, or terminations, and any electrical bonding, for HIRF and lightning \\nprotection that are required when the engine is installed. The applicant should perform the HIRF \\nand lightning tests with the same shielding and electrical bonding configuration specified in the engine installation or operating instructions. \\n(c) HIRF minimum levels . The following table identifies the minimum system \\nlaboratory HIRF RF susceptibility test standards for EECS: \\nRTCA/DO -160G Categories \\nConducted Radiated \\nCW & SW \\nModulation Radiated \\nPulse \\nModulation \\nFixed -Wing Airplanes \\nwith Turbine Engines Cat W (150 mA) Cat W (100 V/m) Cat D (up to 750 V/m) \\nRotorcraft (all engine \\ntypes) Cat W (150 mA) Cat Y (200 V/m) Cat F (up to 1500 \\nV/m) \\nReciprocating Engine \\nIntended for use with \\nPropellers ( Note 1) Cat W (150 mA) Cat W (100 V/m) Cat D (up to 750 V/m) \\nFuselage -Mounted \\nTurbofan Engine \\nIntended for use on \\nPart23 Airplanes \\n(Note 2) Cat Y (300 mA) 100 MHz to 400 MHz – \\nCat G (100 V/m ) \\n400MHz to 18GHz – Cat F \\n(up to 150V/m ) Cat F (up to 1500 \\nV/m) \\nNote 1: Using these HIRF test levels and the design requirements in paragraph (e) below, \\nreciprocating engines with EECSs intended for use on propeller-driven Part 23 airplanes should be acceptable without further airplane HIRF testing. \\nNote 2: Using these HIRF test levels and the design requirements in paragraph (e) below, \\nturbofan engines with EECSs intended to be fuselage-mounted on part 23 airplanes should be \\nacceptable without further HIRF testing. \\n9\\n \\n      \\n         \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n         \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n      \\n          \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n           \\n   \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(d) Lightning levels . The applicant should test the EECS using the minimum levels \\nfor system laboratory lightning tests specified in RTCA/DO-160G Section 22 Level 3 for cable bundle injection tests and pin injection tests. The waveform set that includes single-stroke, multiple-stroke, and multiple-burst waveforms for shielded wire bundles should be Category A3J3L3 in RTCA/DO-160G Section 22. The applicant should not use series impedance during the pin injection tests (RTCA/DO-160G Section 22.5.1.h) unless the remote load impedance is in a component included as part of the engine or the remote load impedance is specified in the engine installation instructions. \\n(e) Alternate lightning levels for reciprocating engines with EECS and intended for \\nuse with propellers, or fuselage-mounted turbofan engine intended for use on Part 23 airplanes . \\nElectronic engine control systems for these types of engine installations are normally subject to very high lightning transients when lightning attaches to the propeller or engine inlet. Using the \\nlightning design and test requirements below, reciprocating engines with EECS intended for use \\non small propeller-driven airplanes or fuselage-mounted turbofan engines intended for use on Part 23 airplanes, should be acceptable for airplane installation without further airplane lightning tests. The reciprocating engine minimum system lightning test levels should be RTCA/DO\\xad160G, Section 22 and Category A3H3L3 for unshielded wire bundles. Lightning commonly strikes the propeller on airplanes with propellers. This results in all lightning current directly conducted on the engine, and a large portion of the current on ECS wiring. Lightning strikes to turbofan engines result in current conducted on the engine cowls and fairings, so typically a smaller portion of the lightning current is conducted on the ECS wiring. The fuselage-mounted turbofan engine minimum system lightning test levels should be RTCA/DO-160G Section 22 and Category B3H3L3 for unshielded wire bundles. These waveform sets includes single-stroke, multiple-stroke, and multiple-burst waveforms in RTCA/DO-160G Section 22. Engine applicants should ensure that the ECS tests, design, and the engine installation or operating \\ninstructions required by § 33.28 and § 33.5 meet the following requirements: \\n1 Lightning test setup. Use the test setup found in RTCA/DO-160G section \\n22.3. Perform the cable bundle injection test with the all EECS wire bundle shields disconnected. \\nThis will ensure that the transients are injected directly onto the wires. Do not use series impedance during the pin injection tests (RTCA/DO-160G Section 22.5.1.h), unless the remote load impedance is in a component included as part of the certified engine or the remote load impedance is specified in the engine installation instructions. \\n2 Wire bundle shields. Install overbraid shields on all wire bundles between \\nEECS components and from EECS components to the airplane. The shields should cover power and signal wires and their returns, and have low resistance and high-optical coverage. An \\noverbraid shield may enclose an entire wire bundle, or multiple overbraid shields may be used \\nover groups of wires within a bundle. For fuselage-mounted turbofan engines, install additional overbraid shields on each wire bundle where the bundle is routed outside the airplane fuselage to the engine. Each shield must be terminated to each connector. Shield terminations must be very short, preferably using backshells with zero length shield terminations. The connector shells and backshells must provide a very low resistance to the engine components, EECS, and airplane firewall or structure. Features required for electrically bonding the connectors to the airplane \\n10\\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n  \\n        \\n \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n            \\n \\n       \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n        5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nfirewall or structure, such as surface preparation, must be specified in the engine installation or \\noperating instructions. \\n3 Engine bonding jumpers. Include at least three electrical bonding jumpers \\nbetween the engine and the engine mounting frame. The bonding jumpers must be flat braided \\nwire or flat solid conductors, with at least 16 mm2 conducting cross section, and less than 30 cm \\nlong. Specify the maximum bonding jumper length and minimum conducting cross section in the engine installation manual. Define the maximum allowed resistance between the engine, engine mounting frame, and airframe in the engine installation or operating instructions. Provide a low-resistance conducting path from the engine to the airframe. \\n4 Electronic engine control systems electrical bonding. Specify the maximum \\nallowed electrical bonding resistance between EECS components and the surface they are \\nmounted on in the engine installation or operating instructions. For example, specify the \\nmaximum allowed resistance between the component and the airframe or firewall to which it is attached. Also, include any special features required for this electrical bonding in the engine installation or operating instructions, such as surface preparation and or bonding jumpers. \\n5 Power and signal returns. You should not use the engine or engine mounting \\nframe for power returns or low-power signal returns. \\n(2) Test procedures . The EECS used for the lightning and HIRF tests should include \\nsensors, actuators, and engine and engine-aircraft interface wire bundles. Use the HIRF and lightning test procedures provided in RTCA/DO-160G/EUROCAE ED-14G Sections 20 and 22. However, the test procedures defined in RTCA/DO-160G/EUROCAE ED-14G Sections 20 and 22 are oriented to equipment tests. Therefore, adapt those test procedures to develop the system \\nlevel HIRF test, the test the applicant will use to show compliance with §§ 33.53 and 33.91. \\n(a) Additional guidance on system level HIRF tests may be found in SAE \\nARP5583A. \\n(b) SAE ARP5415A and ARP5416A provide guidance on system level lightning \\ntests. \\n(3) Open loop and closed loop testing . Conduct HIRF and lightning tests on the ECS \\noperating in closed loop or open loop control. The closed loop set-up is usually power ed to move \\nactuators to close the inner actuating loops. The applicant may use a simplified engine simulation \\nto close the outer engine loop. The applicant should conduct the HIRF and lightning tests with the ECS controlling at the most sensitive operating point, as selected and detailed in the applicant’s test plans. The reference to ‘the most sensitive operating point’ is in rela tionship to \\nschedule sensitivity. We are suggesting that the set point not be where controlling schedules are on flat portions of the schedules. The system should be exposed to the HIRF and lightning environments while operating at the selected condition. HIRF and lightning environments may have different most sensitive operating points. \\n(4) Test considerations . \\n(a) If special ECS test software is embedded in the target for EMC, HIRF or \\n11\\n \\n      \\n      \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n       \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n \\n        \\n  \\n           \\n  \\n       \\n      \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n     \\n \\n       \\n     \\n \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nlightning testing, th e applicant must ensure that the softwar e was developed and implemented by \\nguidelines defined for software levels of at least Level 2 in DO-178A, Level C in DO-178B, \\nLevel C in DO-178C, or equivalent. In some cases, the applicants modify the application code to include the required test code features. \\n(b) The test must be capable of monitoring both the output drive signals and the \\ninput signals. \\n(c) The applicant must duplicate all anomalies observed on inputs or outputs during \\nopen loop testing to enable the test to show compliance with the following pass/fail criteria. The applicant must perform this duplication on the engine simulation to determine whether the resulting power or thrust perturbations comply with the §§ 33.53 and 33.91 test pass/fail criteria. \\n(5) Pass/fail criteria . To comply with §§ 33.53 and 33.91, the HIRF and lightning \\ntests must cause no adverse effects on the functionality of the ECS. The following are adverse effects: \\n(a) For turbine engines: a change greater than 3% of most sensitive operating point \\nor 1% of take-off power or thrust, whichever is greater, for a period of more than 2 seconds. \\n(b) For reciprocating engines: a change greater than 10% of power at the operating \\npoint for a period of more than 2 seconds. \\n(c) Transfers to alternate channels, backup systems, or alternate modes. \\n(d) Component damage. Certain protection components, such as transient \\nsuppression diodes, may experience failures that are not detected by post-test automatic test plan (ATP), and must be checked with specific test procedures. \\n(e) False annunciation to the crew that could cause unnecessary or inappropriate \\ncrew action. \\n(f) Erroneous operation of protection systems, such as over-speed or thrust reverser \\ncircuits. \\n(6) Engine applicants should ensure that the ECS design and the engine installation or \\noperating instructions required by § 33.28 and § 33.5, specify the following protection features: \\n(a) The engine and EECS are installed in an airplane with engine cowls and a \\nfirewall that incorporate electrically conducting materials. The conducting materials may be aluminum, copper, steel or carbon fiber composites, and may include thin metal foil or mesh incorporated into nonconducting composites. The EECS should be installed either under the conducting cowl or on an airframe that uses structure with similar conducting materials. \\n12\\n \\n      \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n    \\n     \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n \\n      \\n        \\n    \\n \\n  5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(b) Required wire shielding and connectors for wire bundles that connect the EECS \\nto airplane systems are specified in the engine installation or operating instructions. The required wire shielding and connectors should be used during the HIRF tests. \\n(c) Electrical bonding requirements for the engine and EECS are specified in the \\nengine installation or operating instructions. \\ne. Maintenance actions . \\n(1) Section 33.4 requires that the applicant prepare Instructions for Continued \\nAirworthiness (ICA ). Instructions for Continuing Airworthiness generally include a maintenance \\nplan. The applicant should provide a maintenance plan for any protection system that is part of the type design of the ECS, and that is required to meet the qualified levels of EMC, HIRF and \\nlightning. The plan is used to ensure the continued airworthiness for the parts of the installed system supplied by the engine type certificate holder. AC 33.4-3 provides information related to the ICA, aircraft engine HIRF, and lightning protection. \\n(2) Consider includ ing periodic inspections or tests for required structural shielding, \\nwire shields, connectors, and equipment protection components, in the ICAs. Also consider inspections or tests when the part is exposed. The applicant should also show that the maintenance actions introduced by its plan are effective in maintaining the engine’s continued \\nairworthiness. \\nf. Time-limited dispatch environmental t ests. Time-Limited Dispatch (TLD) is an \\noptional requirement. If the applicant conducts EMC, HIRF and lightning tests for TLD, we recommend that the testing be done with other tests at certification. Refer to paragraph 7.c. of the \\nPolicy Memorandum, PS-ANE100-2001-1993-33.28TLD-R1, for the TLD requirements related \\nto environmental compliance. \\n13\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n  AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 5 - SECTION 33.28(c) – CONTROL TRANSITIONS . \\n5-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(c) reads: \\n“c. Control Transitions. (1) The applicant must demonstrate that, when fault or failure results in \\na change from one control mode to another, from one channel to another, or from the primary \\nsystem to the backup system, the change occurs so that: \\n(i) The engine does not exceed any of its operating limitations, \\n(ii) The engine does not surge, stall, or experience unacceptable thrust or power changes or \\noscillations or other unacceptable characteristics; and \\n(iii) There is a means to alert the flight crew if the crew is required to initiate, respond to, or be \\naware of the control mode change. The means to alert the crew must be described in the engine \\ninstallation instructions, and the crew action must be described in the engine operating instructions; \\n(2) The magnitude of any change in thrust or power and the associated transition time must be \\nidentified and described in the engine installation instructions and the engine operating \\ninstructions.” \\n5-2. Guidance: Control Transitions . \\na. General . \\n(1) In the showing of compliance to § 33.28(c)(1), the applicant should perform all \\nnecessary testing and analysis to ensure that all control modes, including those that occur as a \\nresult of control fault accommodation strategies, are implemented as required. \\n(2) The applicant should show that all declared dispatchable control modes are capable \\nof performing their intended functions in the environmental conditions, including but not limited to EMI, HIRF and lightning, declared in the engine installation instructions. \\n(3) The need to provide protective functions, such as ov er-speed protection, for all \\ncontrol modes, including any alternate modes, must be reviewed under the requirements of § 33.28(d), (e), and (f) and § 33.75. \\n(4) The above applies to the ECS operating in any dispatchable configuration. \\n(5) The applicant must show that any limitations on operations in alternate modes are \\nclearly stated in the engine installation and operating instructions. \\n(6) The applicant should provide in the engine installation and operating instructions a \\ndescription of the E CS operating in its primary and alternate modes. \\n14\\n \\n      \\n         \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n       \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n \\n        \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n  5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(7) The applicant should use analyses, or testing, or both, to show that changing to, and \\noperating in, alternate modes has no unacceptable effect on engine durability or endurance. This should not be interpreted as the need to run multiple §33.87 endurance tests. Short segments of testing in combination with analysis may be sufficient for showing of compliance. \\n(8) The applicant should demonstrate the durability and reliability of the control \\nsystem in all modes, primarily through the engine system and component testing of §§ 33.53 and 33.91. Performing some portion of the engine certification testing in the alternate mode(s) and during transition between modes can be used as part of the system validation required under § 33.28(b)(1). \\n(9) Engine test considerations . \\n(a) The engine certification tests defined in part 33, Subparts D and F, are often \\nperformed using only the ECS ’s primary mode. I f the applicant requests approval for dispatch in \\nan alternate mode under TLD, then the applicant must demonstrate that the engine can meet the defined test-success criteria in any alternate mode that is proposed as a dispatchable configuration. If a configuration is to be dispatchable, then that mode should be demonstrated to operate in all foreseeable environmental conditions. This demonstration may use analysis or test and should include capabilities such as operability in rain or hail or bird ingestion. \\n(b) Some capabilities, such as operability in rain or hail or bird ingestion, may be \\nlost in some control modes that are not dispatchable. Modes that are not dispatchable do not require engine test demonstration as long as the engine installation and operating instructions reflect this loss of capability. \\n(10) Availability . Applicants should demonstrate through testing or monitoring, that \\nany backup mode will be available when needed. The applicant should document in the ICA the minimum frequency of inspection or testing needed to ensure its availability. \\nb. Crew training modes . As part of the System Safety Assessment of 33.28(e), applicants \\nshould assess crew training modes. These modes are usually installation, and possibly operator specific and need to be negotiated on a case- by-case basis. For example, one common \\napplication of crew training modes is simulation of the ‘fail -fixed’ mode on a twin -engine \\nrotorcraft. The applicant must describe training modes in the engine installation and operating instructions as appropriate. Also, the applicant must take precautions in the design of the ECS and its crew interfaces to prevent inadvertent entry into any training modes. The applicant must assess crew-training modes, including lockout systems. \\nc. Non-dispatchable configurations and modes . \\n(1) For control configurations that are not dispatchable, but for which the applicant \\nseeks to take credit in the system LOTC/LOPC analysis (this analysis and the LOTC/LOPC concept are covered in full in Chapter 6 below), specific operating limitations may be acceptable. This means that the system will not be charged with an LOTC/LOPC event when the fault is \\ncovered by a backup means that allows the system to continue to function safely. The system, \\n15\\n \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n       \\n \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n       \\n  \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nhowever, would not be dispatchable in this configuration. Compliance with § 33.28(b)(1) in non\\xad\\ndispatchable configurations does not imply strict compliance with the operability requirements of \\n§ 33.65 and § 33.89, if applicants demonstrate that in the intended installation no likely pilot control system inputs will result in engine surge, stall, flameout, or unmanageable delay in power recovery or engine controllability issues. For example, in a twin-engine rotorcraft, a rudimentary backup system may be adequate since frequent and rapid changes in power setting when operating in the backup system may not be necessary. In this example, it is very unlikely that dispatch would be allowed with the engine controlled by this rudimentary backup system. \\n(2) In addition to these operability considerations, the applicant should consider the \\nfollowing factors in assessing the acceptability of a reduced-capability backup mode: \\n(a) The installed operating characteristics of the backup mode and the differences \\nfrom the primary mode. \\n(b) The likely impact of the backup mode operations on pilot workload, if the \\naircraft installation is known. \\n(c) The frequency of transfer from the primary mode to the backup mode (i.e. the \\nreliability of the primary mode). Frequencies of transfer of less than 1 per 20,000 engine flight hours are acceptable. \\nd. Control transitions . \\n(1) Section 33.28(c) requires that any control transitions that occur as a result of fault \\naccommodation occur in an acceptable manner. \\n(2) In general, the ECS should transition to alternate modes automatically. However, \\nsystems in which pilot action is required to engage the backup mode are also acceptable. For instance, a fault in the primary system may result in a “fail -fixed” fuel flow that requires some \\naction by the pilot to engage the backup system to modulate engine power. When pilot action is required, applicants should ensure that any reliance on a pilot executing a manual transition does not pose an unacceptable operating characteristic, unacceptable crew workload, or require exceptional skill. \\n(3) The applicant must review the transient change in power or thrust associated with \\ntransfer to alternate modes for compliance with § 33.28(c). If available, consider input from the installer. \\n(4) Applicants should consider at the minimum, the following items when reviewing \\ncontrol mode transitions: \\n(a) The frequency of occurrence of transfers to any alternate mode and the \\ncapability of the alternate mode. Applicants should support computed frequency-of-transfer rates with data from endurance or reliability testing, in-service experience on similar equipment, or \\nother appropriate data. \\n16\\n \\n      \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n  \\n        \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n \\n   \\n      \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n \\n       \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(b) The magnitude of the power, thrust, rotor or propeller speed transients may \\naffect the dynamics of the aircraft. Therefore these transients should be carefully assessed to assure acceptability for installation. The applicant should coordinate these characteristics with the intended installer. \\n(c) Successful demonstration, by simulation or other means, that the ECS controls \\nthe engine during the transition. In some cases, particularly those involving rotorcraft, applicants may be unable, analytically or through simulation, to show that the ECS can control the engine \\nduring mode transition. Therefore, applicants should propose a flight test program to demonstrate that the ECS controls the engine acceptably during in-flight control mode transitions. \\n(d) An analysis to identify those faults that cause either automatic or pilot initiated \\ncontrol mode transitions. \\n(e) For turboprop or turboshaft engines, the control mode transition should not \\nresult in excessive over-speed or under-speed of the rotor or propeller. These speed transitions could cause emergency shutdown, loss of electrical generator power, or setting off warning devices. \\n(f) Including in the engine installation instructions, a declaration of the power or \\nthrust change associated with a transition. If the change is negli gible, declare it as such. \\n(5) Time delays . Applicants should include in the engine installation and operating \\ninstructions a description of any observable time delays associated with control mode, channel or \\nsystem transitions, or in re- establishing the pilot’s ability to modulate engine thrust or power. \\nThe acceptability of these delays may need to be assessed during aircraft certification. \\n(6) Annunciation to the flight c rew. \\n(a) If annunciation is necessary to comply with § 33.28(c)(1)(iii), the type of \\nannunciation to the flight crew must be commensurate with the nature of the transition. For example, the form of annunciation for a reversion to an alternate mode of control when the transition is automatic and the only observable changes in engine operation are different thrust control schedules would be very different than if timely action by the pilot is required to maintain control of the aircraft. \\n(b) The intent and purpose of the cockpit annunciation must be clearly stated in the \\nengine installation and operating instructions, as appropriate. \\n17\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n         \\n      \\n   \\n          \\n  \\n        \\n   \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 6. SECTION 33.28(d) – ENGINE CONTROL SYSTEM FAILURES . \\n6-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(d) reads: \\n“d. Engine control system failures. The applicant must design and construct the engine control \\nsystem so that: \\n(1) The rate for Loss of Thrust (or Power) Control (LOTC/LOPC) events, consistent with the \\nsafety objective associated with the intended application can be achieved; (2) In the full-up configuration, the system is single fault tolerant, as determined by the \\nAdministrator, for electrical or electronic failures with respect to LOTC/LOPC events; \\n(3) Single failures of engine control system components shall not result in a hazardous engine \\neffect; and \\n(4) Foreseeable failures or malfunctions leading to local events in the intended aircraft \\ninstallation such as fire, overheat, or failures leading to damage to engine control system \\ncomponents do not result in a hazardous engine effect due to engine control system failures or malfunctions.” \\n6-2 Guidance: Engine Control System Failures . \\na. Objective . Section 33.28(d) establish es ECS integrity requirements that are consistent \\nwith the operational requirements of the various installations. The introduction of EECSs should \\nprovide at least an equivalent level of safety and reliability for the engine as achieved by engines \\nequipped with hydro-mechanical control and protection systems and magneto systems (refer to \\nSAE ARP5107B and FAA Policy Memorandums on TLD in paragraph 3.b.). In chapters 9 and 15 of this AC, the concept of development errors being introduced within the software, or AEH designs ,or both, and the development assurance processes are addressed. This chapter and chapter 7 discuss the development error concept at the system level for an ECS. \\nb. Criteria for an LOTC/LOPC event . Industry practice over the past 30 years has \\nresulted in the following generally accepted criteria for defining an LOTC/LOPC event. The applicant may propose another set of criteria if it defines an LOTC/LOPC event. \\n(1) For turbine engines not intended for rotorcraft, we consider an LOTC/LOPC event \\noccurs when the ECS: \\n(a) Has lost the capability to modulate thrust or power between idle and 90% of \\nmaximum rated power or thrust, \\n(b) Suffers a fault that results in a thrust or power oscillation greater than the levels \\ngiven in Paragraph 6-2c of this AC, or \\n18\\n \\n      \\n       \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n         \\n      \\n         \\n   \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n          \\n         \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n       \\n        \\n  \\n         \\n    \\n      \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(c) Has lost the capability to govern the engine in a manner that allows compliance \\nwith the operability regulations given in §§ 33.65 and 33.89. \\n(2) For turbine engines intended for helicopters, an LOTC/LOPC event occurs when \\nthe ECS: \\n(a) Has lost the capability to modulate power between idle and 90% of maximum \\nrated power at flight condition and, if appropriate, at rotorcraft operating condition, or \\n(b) Suffers a fault that results in a power oscillation greater than the levels given in \\nParagraph 6-2 c of this AC, or \\n(c) Has lost the capability to govern the engine in a manner that allows compliance \\nwith the operability regulations given in §§ 33.65 and 33.89. The inability, however, to meet the operability regulations in the alternate modes may not need to be included as LOPC events. \\n1 Single-engine rotorcraft will normally be required to meet the operability \\nregulations in the alternate modes. Engine operability in alternate modes is a necessity if the control transitions to the alternate mode occur more frequently than the acceptable LOPC rate, or normal flight crew activity requires rapid changes in power to safely fly the aircraft. \\n2 The LOPC definition typically includes the ability to meet the operability \\nregulations in the alternate mode(s). For multiengine rotorcraft, it may be acceptable if one \\nengine control transitions to an alternate mode that may not have robust operability. That engine can be left at reasonably fixed power condition so that the engines with normally operating controls can change power as necessary to complete aircraft maneuvers and safely land the \\naircraft. Where this potential exists, i.e., differing operability levels, applicants may be required \\nto demonstrate the ECS continues to meet regulatory standards under all conditions at aircraft certification. \\n(3) For reciprocating engines intended for part 23 Class I., II., and III. Aircraft, an \\nLOPC event occurs when the ECS: \\n(a) Has lost the capability to modulate power between idle and 85% of maximum \\nrated power at all operating conditions, or \\n(b) Suffers a fault that results in a power oscillation greater than the levels given in \\nParagraph 6-2 c. of this AC, or \\n(c) Has lost the capability to govern the engine in a manner that allow s \\ncompliance with the operability regulations in § 33.51. \\n(4) For engines incorporating functions for propeller control integrated in the EECS, \\nthe applicant should consider the following faults or failures, either individually or in combination with another, as LOPC events: \\n19\\n \\n      \\n       \\n \\n       \\n        \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n       \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n     \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(a) Inability to command a change in pitch,  \\n(b) Uncommanded change in pitch, \\n(c) Uncontrollable propeller torque or speed fluctuation. \\nc. Uncommanded thrust or power oscillations . Any uncommanded thrust or power \\noscillations should not be of such a magnitude as to affect aircraft controllability. For example, \\nthrust or power oscillations less than 10% peak- to-peak of take-off power, or thrust, or both, are \\nacceptable where oscillation affects one engine only, unles s the installer defines more or less \\nrestrictive requirements. Regardless of the levels discussed here, if the flight crew has to shut down an engine because of unacceptable thrust or power oscillations caused by the control system, we would deem such an event as an in-service LOTC/LOPC event. \\nd. Acceptable LOTC/LOPC rate . The applicant may propose an LOTC/LOPC rate other \\nthan those below. The applicant should substantiate such a proposal in relation to the criticality of the engine and control system relative to the intended installation. The intent is to show equivalence of the LOTC/LOPC rate to existing systems in comparable installations. Refer to SAE ARP5107B and FAA Policy Memorandum, PS-ANE100-2001-1993-33.28TLD- R1 for \\nadditional information. \\n(1) For turbine engines, the EECS should not cause more than one LOTC/LOPC event \\nper 100,000 engine flight hours. \\n(2) For reciprocating engines intended for part 23 Class I., II., and III. aircraft, an \\nLOPC rate of 45 per million engine flight hours (or 1 per 22,222 engine flight hours) represents \\nthe upper limit of an acceptable level for the most complex EECS. As a result of the architectures \\nused in many of the EECS for these engines, the functions are implemented as independent system elements. These system elements or subsystems can be fuel control, ignition control, or others. For systems with only one element, such as a fuel control, we recommend applicants use \\na maximum system LOPC rate of 15 LOPC events per million engine flight hours (PMEFH). For \\nsystems that contain more than one element, we recommend applicants use a LOPC rate of 15 \\nevents PMEFH for each, but only up to 45 events PMEFH. So, if two elements are present, for example a fuel control and an ignition control, the appropriate rate is 30 events PMEFH. If three or more, then the LOPC rate would be 45 events PMEFH. \\ne. LOTC/LOPC analysis . \\n(1) Since the LOTC/LOPC analysis is part of the required System Safety Assessment \\nof §33.28(e), applicants must perform and submit an LOTC/LOPC analysis for the ECS. An ECS LOTC/LOPC analysis may take the form of a system reliability analysis (refer to SAE ARP5107B). We recommend a numerical analysis such as a Markov model analysis, fault tree analysis, or equivalent analytical approach. \\n20\\n \\n      \\n      \\n  \\n \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n      \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n      \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n    \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(2) The LOTC/LOPC analysis should address all components in the system that can \\ncontribute to LOTC/LOPC events. This includes all electrical (including wiring), mechanical, hydromechanical, and pneumatic elements of the ECS. \\n(3) The engine fuel pump is usually considered part of the fuel delivery system and, \\ntherefore, not included in an LOTC/LOPC analysis. \\n(4) An LOTC/LOPC analysis should include those sensors or elements that may not be \\npart of the engine type design, but that may contribute to LOTC/LOPC events. An example is the throttle or power lever transducer, which is usually supplied by the installer. The LOTC/LOPC analysis should include the effects of loss, corruption, or failure of aircraft-supplied data. The engine installation instructions should include the assumed reliability and interface requirements for these nonengine type design elements. Within the aircraft system safety analyses, we \\nrecommend that installers ensure no double counting of the rate of failure of nonengine parts occurs. \\n(5) The LOTC/LOPC analysis should also consider all faults, both detected and \\nundetected. The applicant should include any periodic maintenance actions needed to find and repair both covered and uncovered faults to meet the LOTC/LOPC rate in the engine instructions for continued airworthiness. \\n(6) See chapter 7 of this AC for additional guidance on how to perform the System \\nSafety Assessment required under § 33.28(e). \\nf. Reliability assessment plan (RAP) . We recommend the applicant prepare, and be \\nready to show us, a RAP (refer to SAE ARP5890A for a framework). A RAP documents the \\napplicant’s controlled, repeatable processes for assessing the reliability of systems and \\nequipment. It also helps assess the reliability of systems and equipment during design and operational life. The results of the RAP are important inputs to many safety assessment and analysis tasks. The results of a RAP can be used as a part of: \\n(1) Reliability program planning and monitoring, \\n(2) Safety assessments and analyses, \\n(3) Certification analyses, \\n(4) Equipment design decisions, \\n(5) System architecture selection, and \\n(6) Continued airworthiness assessments. \\n21\\n \\n      \\n      \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n  5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\ng. Commercial or industrial grade electronic parts . \\n(1) The grade and handling of electronic parts is an important contributor to the \\nreliability of the EEC. Two examples of industry documents that provide guidance on the application of commercial or industrial grade components are: \\n(a) IEC/TS 62239-1, Process Management for Avionics – Preparation of an \\nElectronic Components Management Plan, and \\n(b) IEC/TR 62240-1, Process Management for Avionics – Use of Semiconductor \\nDevices Outside Manufacturers’ Specified Temperature Ranges . \\n(2) The applicant should prepare, and be ready to show us, their Electronic Component \\nManagement Plan (ECMP). \\n(3) When applicants specify as part of the engine type design commercial or industrial-\\ngrade electronic components, which are not manufactured to military standards, we recommend considering data similar to the following, as applicable: \\n(a) Reliability data for each commercial and industrial grade electrical component \\nspecified in the design. \\n(b) The applicant’s procurement, quality assurance, and process control plans for \\nthe vendor-supplied commercial and industrial grade parts. These plans should ensure that the parts will be able to maintain the reliability level specified in the approved engine type design. \\n(c) Unique databases, for similar components, obtained from different vendors \\nbecause commercial and industrial grade parts may not all be manufactured to the same accepted industry standard. \\n(4) Temperature ranges for commercial or industrial grade parts are typically a \\nnarrower range than those for military grade parts. \\n(a) If the applicant’s declared temperature environment for the ECS will result in \\nthe detail parts exceeding the stated capability of the commercial or industrial grade electronic components, the applicant should ensure through test and analysis, that the proposed range of the specified components is suitable for the intended ECS environment. The applicant should also show that the failure rates used for those components in the System Safety Asssessment ( SSA) \\nand LOTC/LOPC analyses are appropriately adjusted for the extended temperature environment. \\n(b) Sometimes commercial or industrial parts are used in an environment beyond \\ntheir specified rating and cooling provisions are required in the design of the EECS. The applicant should specify these provisions in the engine installation instructions, if action by the installer is required to provide cooling. This provision ensures that the cooling is not compromised. The cooling provisions included in the EECS design may have failure modes. If \\n22\\n \\n      \\n      \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n       \\n \\n      \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n       \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n   \\n    \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nthe failure mode s could result in exceeding temperature limits, then applicants should account for \\nthe probability of these failures in their SSA and LOTC/LOPC analyses. \\n(5) When any electrical or electronic components are changed, the applicant should \\nreview their SSA and LOTC/LOPC analyses with regard to the impact of any changes in \\ncomponent reliability. Component, subassembly or assembly level testing may be needed to evaluate a change that introduces commercial or industrial part(s). However, such a change would not be classified as “significant” with respect to § 21.101(b)(1). \\nh. Single fault accommodation . \\n(1) The following guidance clarifies the meaning of “single fault tolerant .” \\n(a) The applicant may show compliance with the single fault regulations of \\n§ 33.28(d)(2) and (3) by test and analys is. According to § 33.28(d), single failures or \\nmalfunctions in the ECS ’s components, in its fully operational condition and all declared \\ndispatchable configurations, must not result in a hazardous engine effect ( refer to § 33.75(g)(2) \\nfor a definition of “hazardous engine effects ”). In addition, § 33.28(d) requires that in its full-up \\nconfiguration, the control system must be essentially single fault tolerant of electrical/electronic component failures with respect to LOTC/LOPC events. \\n(b) We recognize that achieving true single fault tolerance could require a \\ntriplicated design approach or one with 100% fault detection. Currently, systems have been designed with dual, redundant channels, or with backup systems that provide what has been called an “essentially single fault tolerant” system. Although these systems may have some \\nsingle faults (that are not covered faults) that lead to LOTC/LOPC events, they have \\ndemonstrated excellent in-service safety and reliability and have proven to be acceptable. \\nTherefore, configurations such as these may be found to be compliant. \\n(2) Dual-channel or backup system configurations cover the vast majority of potential \\nelectrical and electronic faults. However, omitting some coverage because detection or accommodation of some electrical or electronic faults may not be practical, may be acceptable. Single, simple electrical or electronic components or circuits can be employed in a reliable manner. In those cases, requiring redundancy may be unnecessary. In those cases, failures in certain single-electrical or electronic components, elements, or circuits may result in an LOTC/LOPC event. These systems, which are referred to as “essentially single fault tolerant,” \\nare acceptable. \\n(3) Single failures that result in a high thrust failure condition, with no throttle \\nresponse, may be catastrophic for some aircraft operating conditions. As a cautionary note, engine certification applicants should be aware that in this case, either a modification of the engine control or an independent aircraft system will be needed for aircraft certification. \\ni. Local events . \\n23\\n \\n      \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n       \\n             \\n \\n \\n      \\n       \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(1) Under § 33.28(d)(4), foreseeable failures or malfunctions leading to local events, \\nsuch as engine or installation-related failures that could lead to damage to control system \\nelectrical harnesses or connectors or to the control units, must not result in a hazardous engine event. We recommend that applicants analyze local events to ensure a hazardous engine event will not occur. These events include: \\n(a) Overheat conditions, for example, those resulting from hot air duct bursts, \\n(b) Fires, \\n(c) Maintenance and foreseeable maintenance errors such as using a wire bundle as \\na hand hold, \\n(d) Fluid leaks, and \\n(e) Mechanical disruptions that could lead to damage to control system electrical \\nharnesses, connectors, or control unit(s). \\n(2) These local events are normally limited to one engine. A local event is not usually \\nconsidered a common mode event, and common mode threats, such as HIRF, lightning and rain, are not considered local events. Examples of a single, common mode fault in systems are single source batteries in multiengine applications and the use of identical software in multiengine, dual-channel systems. In these and similar cases, the applicant should take extra design, testing or maintenance precautions to ensure safety. \\n(3) Although they are limited to one engine, local events affecting the ECS should not \\ngenerate hazards to the aircraft. Local events, in particular fire and overheat, are dependent on installations and may also be addressed as a part of aircraft certification. Coordination with the installer is highly advised. \\n(4) Invalid assumptions of independence between failures, as well as failure to \\nrecognize common cause failure modes, are leading reasons for invalid conclusions within safety analyses. In the assessment of local events, emphasis should be placed on identifying and ensuring critical functional or physical isolation is maintained. The applicant should ensure no \\ncommon cause event is present that would violate any assumptions of independence between failures. For example, fuel control components whose failure could result in overspeed are not affected by the same events that could cause loss of overspeed protection. \\n(5) Whatever the local event, the behavior of the EECS must not cause a hazardous \\nengine effect in any declared dispatchable mode. \\n(6) When demonstrating that no hazardous engine effect exists based on the \\nassumption that another function exists to provide the necessary protection, the applicant should show that the other function is not rendered inoperative by the same event (including destruction of wires, ducts, or power supplies). \\n24\\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n     \\n   \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n        \\n       \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n       \\n \\n   5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(7) An overheat condition exists when the temperature of the system components is \\ngreater than the maximum safe design operating temperature declared by the engine applicant in the engine installation instructions. The ECS must not cause a hazardous engine effect when the components or units of the system are exposed to an overheat or over-temperature condition, or when it cools down. Applicants may use specific design features or analysis methods to show prevention of hazardous engine effects. We may require testing when this is not possible. For example, due to the variability or the complexity of the failure sequence. Refer to SAE ARP5757 for an example of this type of testing. \\n(8) The ECS, including the electrical, electronic, and mechanical parts of the system, \\nmust comply with the fire regulations of § 33.17. This rule applies to the elements of the ECS that are installed in designated fire zones. Refer to SAE ARP5757 and AC 33.17-1 for additional guidance. \\n(9) If an ECS component is located so that it could present an ignition source for \\nflammable fluids or vapors, the applicant should conduct an explosion proof demonstration to verify that the component cannot be the source of ignition for an explosion. Refer to SAE ARP5757 for this type of demonstration. \\n(10) Applicants should consider all foreseeable local events when complying with \\n§ 33.28(d)(4). We recognize, however, that it is difficult to address all possible local events in the intended aircraft installation at the time of engine certification. Therefore, the applicant should use sound engineering judgment to identify reasonably foreseeable local events. Compliance with this regulation may be shown by considering the end result of the local event on the ECS. Well documented local events and their analysis will aid in engine installation certification. \\n(11) The following guidance applies to ECS wiring. \\n(a) Test or analyze each wire or combination of wires interfacing with the EECS \\nthat could be affected by a local event. The assessment should include opens, shorts to ground, \\nand shorts to power (when appropriate). The results should show that faults result in specific responses and do not result in hazardous engine effects. Any EEC system component connector that becomes disconnected while the engine is operating must not result in a hazardous engine effect. Nor should it endanger the continued safe flight and landing of the aircraft. \\n(b) The applicant should test or analyze engine control unit aircraft interface wiring \\nfor shorts to aircraft power. T hese “hot” shorts should result in a specific and non -hazardous \\nengine effect. Where aircraft interface wiring is involved, the engine installation instructions should inform the installer of the potential effects of shorts in the interface wiring. The installer should ensure that no wiring faults exist that are not detectable and not accommodated. Also, these wiring faults must not result in a hazardous engine effect. \\n(c) Where practical, wiring faults should not affect more than one channel. The \\nengine applicant should include any assumptions regarding channel separation in the \\nLOTC/LOPC analysis. \\n25\\n \\n      \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(d) Where physical separation of conductors is not practical, the engine applicant \\nand the installer should coordinate to ensure that the potential for common mode faults is \\nminimized between channels on one engine and eliminated between ECSs. \\n(e) The applicant should test and analyze the effects of fluid leaks impinging on \\nEECS components. Impingement must not result in a hazardous engine effect, and the fluids should not impinge on circuitry or printed circuit boards, nor result in a potential latent failure condition. \\n(f) If the installation of the engine could be subject to part 25 rules, refer to the \\napplicable sections of 14 CFR 25, Subpart H, Electrical Wiring Interconnection Systems (EWIS). \\n26\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n      \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n      \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 7. SECTION 33.28(e) – SYSTEM SAFETY ASSESSMENT . \\n7-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(e) reads: “(e) System safety assessment. When complying with this \\nsection and 33.75, the applicant must complete a System Safety Assessment for the engine \\ncontrol system. This assessment must identify faults or failures that result in a change in thrust or power, transmission of erroneous data, or an effect on engine operability producing a surge or stall together with the predicted frequency of occurrence of these faults or failures.” \\n7-2 Guidance: System Safety Assessment . Refer to Appendix 3 “Guidance for System Safety \\nAssessment for EECS Applied to Reciprocating Engines. ” \\na. Scope of the assessment . The methods presented in ARP4761 for conducting safety \\nassessment are recognized for ECS assessments. \\n(1) The SSA required under § 33.28 (e) must address all operating modes. \\n(2) The LOTC/LOPC analysis described in § 33.28(d) is a subset of the SSA. The \\nLOTC/LOPC analysis and SSA may be separate or combined as a single analysis. For clarity, the remainder of the discussion mentions only the SSA, but it is equally applicable to an LOTC/LOPC analysis or combined SSA/LOTC/LOPC analysis. \\n(3) The SSA mu st consider all faults, both detected and undetected, and their effects on \\nthe ECS and engine operation. The SSA must also include faults or malfunctions in aircraft signals, including electrical opens, shorts, data validation, signal input errors and any other malfunction defined by the installer. These malfunctions should include those in a multiengine aircraft installation that could affect more than one engine. These types of faults are addressed \\nunder § 33.28(h). \\n(4) The ECS SSA should identify the applicable assumptions and installation \\nrequirements. It should also establish any limitations relating to ECS operation. These \\nassumptions, requirements, and limitations should be stated in the engine installation and operating instructions, as appropriate. \\n(5) As necessary, the airworthiness limitations section of the instructions for continued \\nairworthiness should include the limitations related to the ECS operation. For example, the LOTC/LOPC analysis may classif y faults into various categories that may require repair within \\nan approved time frame. Refer to SAE ARP5107B for additional information. \\n(6) The SSA must address all failure effects identified under § 33.75, as appropriate. \\nThe applicant may reference the § 33.75 analysis in this SSA when appropriate. \\n(7) The applicant must provide a summary listing the malfunctions or failures and their \\neffects caused by the ECS, such as: \\n(a) Failures affecting power or thrust resulting in LOTC/LOPC events. \\n27\\n \\n      \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n       \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(b) Failures that result in the engi ne’s inability to meet the operability regulations. \\nIf these failure cases are not considered LOTC/LOPC events according to the criteria of Chapter \\n6, then document the expected frequency of occurrence for these events. \\n(c) Transmission of erroneous parameters, for example; false high indication of the \\nthrust or power setting that could lead to thrust or power changes greater than 3% of take-off power, or thrust, or both, (10% for reciprocating engines installations), or high exhaust gas temperature or turbine temperatures, or low-oil pressure that could lead to engine shutdown. These levels have typically been considered unacceptable, however, applicants may propose \\ndifferent levels for a specific engine. \\n(d) Failures affecting aircraft functions included in the ECS, for example, propeller \\ncontrol, thrust reverser control, control of cooling air, or control of fuel recirculation. \\n(e) Failures resulting in major engine effects and hazardous engine effects. In \\naddition, reciprocating engine applicants must address failures resulting in destructive events. \\n(8) The SSA should also consider all signals used by the ECS, particularly any cross-\\nengine control signals and air pressure signals as described in § 33.28(j). \\n(9) The SSA should include functions implemented in the ECS that involve aircraft \\nlevel functions. The aircraft applicant needs to define the criticality of aircraft level functions. \\nb. Criteria . The SSA should demonstrate or provide the following: \\n(1) Compliance with §§ 33.75, as appropriate. \\n(2) For failures leading to LOTC/LOPC events, Chapter 6, paragraph 6-2.d., provides \\nguidance on compliance with the agreed LOTC/LOPC rate for the intended installation. \\n(3) For failures affecting engine operability but not necessarily leading to \\nLOTC/LOPC events, only the rate of occurrence of the faults that could lead to an operability limitation should be documented. Any aircraft flight deck indications deemed necessary to inform the flight crew of such a failure will be determined at aircraft certification. \\n(4) The applicant must identify the consequences of the transmission by the \\nECS of a faulty parameter that is not indicated or identified as failed or faulty. If the consequence can result in loss of the ability to set power, then that fault should be \\nincluded in the LOTC/LOPC analysis. The engine operating instructions should include \\nany information necessary to mitigate the consequences of a detected faulty parameter transmission. For example, the engine operating instructions may indicate that a display of zero oil pressure may be ignored in flight if the oil quantity and temperature displays appear normal. In this situation, failure to transmit oil pressure or transmitting a zero oil pressure signal should not lead to an engine shutdown or LOTC/LOPC event. \\n28\\n \\n      \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n  5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(5) Flight crew initiated shutdowns have occurred in-service as the result of \\nfailure conditions, such as the ECS transmitting a faulty parameter. If the engine \\noperating instructions provide information to mitigate this failure condition, then control \\nsystem faults or malfunctions leading to the failure condition would not have to be included in the LOTC/LOPC analysis. In the case of the ECS transmitting faulty parameters, the loss of multiple functions should be included in the LOTC/LOPC analysis. For example, if the display of zero oil pressure and zero oil quantity (or high oil temperature) would result in a crew-initiated shutdown, then the applicant should include those failures in the systems LOTC/LOPC analysis. \\nc. Malfunctions or faults affecting thrust or power . \\n(1) In multiengine aircraft, faults that result in thrust or power changes of less than \\napproximately 10% of take-off power or thrust, may be undetectable by the flight crew. This level is based on pilot assessment and has been used for a number of years. Pilots have indicated that flight crews will note engine operating differences when the difference is greater than 10% in asymmetric thrust or power. A thrust change larger than 10% of take-off power or thrust, may be acceptable if authorized by the installer. \\n(2) Engine applicants and the installer should agree on the detectable difference level \\nfor engines for other installations. This is important as the installation can significantly affect the pilot’s ability to detect the operating difference between engines. If the pilot cannot detect this \\ndifference and take appropriate action, the result may be hazardous to the aircraft. \\n(3) When operating in the take-off envelope, uncovered faults in the ECS that result in \\na thrust or power change of less than 3% (10% for reciprocating engines installations) are \\ngenerally considered acceptable. However, this does not diminish the applicant’s obligation to \\nensure that the full-up system is capable of providing the declared minimum rated thrust or \\npower. In this regard, faults that could result in small thrust changes should be random in nature and detectable and correctable during routine inspections, overhauls, or power-checks. \\n(4) The SSA documentation should include the frequency of occurrence of uncovered \\nfaults that result in a thrust or power change greater than 3% of take-off power, or thrust, but less than the change defined as an LOTC/LOPC event. No specific regulations relating to this class of faults for engine certification exist. However, the rate of occurrence of these types of faults should be reasonably low. We recommend on the order of 10\\n-5 events per engine flight hour or \\nless. Documentation of these faults may be required in the aircraft certification analysis. \\n(5) Signals sent from one ECS to another, such as signals used for an ATTCS, APR or \\nsynchrophasing, are addressed under § 33.28(h). These cross-engine signals should be limited in authority by the receiving ECS, so that undetected faults do not result in an unacceptable change in thrust or power for the engine using those signals. The maximum thrust or power loss on the engine using a cross-engine signal should generally be limited to 3% absolute difference of the current operating condition. The ATTCS or APR, when activated, may command a thrust or power increase of 10% or more on the remaining engine(s). These thrust and power losses do not \\nhave to be considered LOTC/LOPC events\\n. In addition, in a rotorcraft installation, signals sent \\n29\\n \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n       \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nfrom one engine control to another, such as load sharing and OEI, can have a much greater \\nimpact on engine power when those signals fail. However, data on these failure modes should be \\nin the SSA. \\n(6) When operating in the take-off envelope, detected faults in the ECS, that result in a \\nthrust or power change of up to 10% (15% for reciprocating engines), may be acceptable if the total frequency of occurrence for these types of failures is relatively low. A thrust change larger than 10% (15% for reciprocating engines) of take-off power, or thrust, may be acceptable if authorized by the installer. The predicted frequency of occurrence for this category of faults should be in the SSA documentation. Requirements for the allowable frequency of occurrence for this category of faults and any need for a flight deck indication of these conditions are reviewed during aircraft certification. A total frequency of occurrence of less than of 10 \\n–5 events \\nper engine flight hour would normally be acceptable, as the occurrence of this on multiple \\nengines would be an extremely remote event. \\n(7) Detected faults in signals exchanged between ECSs should be accommodated so as \\nnot to result in greater than a 3% thrust or power change on the engine using the cross-engine \\nsignals. \\n30\\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n        \\n \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n        \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n     \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 8 . SECTION 33.28(f) – PROTECTION SYSTEMS . \\n8-1 Rule Text . Section 33.28(f ) reads: “Protection Systems. \\n“(f) Protection Systems. (1) The design and functioning of engine control devices and systems, \\ntogether with engine instruments and operating and maintenance instructions, must provide reasonable assurance that those engine operating limitations that affect turbine, compressor, fan, and turbosupercharger rotor structural integrity will not be exceeded in service. \\n(2) When electronic overspeed protection systems are provided, the design must include a \\nmeans for testing, at least once per engine start/stop cycle, to establish the availability of the protection function. The means must be such that a complete test of the system can be achieved in the minimum number of cycles. If the test is not fully automatic, the requirement for a manual \\ntest must be contained in the engine instructions for operation. \\n(3) When overspeed protection is provided through hydromechanical or mechanical means, \\nthe applicant must demonstrate by test or other acceptable means that the overspeed function \\nremains available between inspection and maintenance periods.” \\n8-2. Guidance: Protection Systems . \\na. Rotor overspeed protection . \\n(1) In engines of recent design, the applicant usually provides overspeed protection, or \\ncircuits, or both, utilizing the engine control devices, systems and instruments referred to in § \\n33.28(f). Although they may be independent devices, the overspeed protection and circuits are \\ngenerally part of the EECS \\n(2) Rotor overspeed protection is usually achieved by providing an independent over-\\nspeed protection system that requires two independent faults or malfunctions (as described \\nbelow) to result in an uncontrolled overspeed. Examples of engine provided, as opposed to ECS provided, overspeed protection include blade shedding, rotor interference, or fuel cutoff methods through rotor axial movement. Engine-provided overspeed protection methods are addressed by § 33.27. \\n(3) The following guidance applies if the rotor overspeed protection is provided solely \\nby an ECS protective function. \\n(a) In all dispatchable configurations, the combined engine control and overspeed \\nprotection system should be at least two independent faults removed from an uncontrolled overspeed event. Hence, a potential rotor burst due to overspeed should only be possible as a result of an independent fault preventing the overspeed protection system from operating properly in combination with a control system fault causing an overspeed. \\n(b) The SSA should show that the probability per engine flight hour of an \\nuncontrolled overspeed condition from any cause in combination with a failure of the overspeed \\n31\\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n         \\n   \\n   \\n \\n 5/23/14\\t AC 33.28-3\\n \\nprotection system to function is less than one event per hundred million hours (a failure rate of \\n10 –8 events per engine flight hour). The SSA should consider all the failure cases associated with \\nthe protection systems. Do not overlook the following case s: \\n\\uf0b7\\t When the fuel metering valve and the fuel shut-off valve (SOV) have a \\ncommon failure mode. \\n\\uf0b7\\t When the metering valve is proposed to be used as the shut-off valve. These single valve systems have been problematic at installation. \\n(c) The overspeed protection system should have a failure rate of less than 10 \\n–4 \\nfailures per engine flight hour to ensure the integrity of the protected function. \\n(d) A self-test of the over-speed protection system to ensure its functionality prior \\nto each subsequent flight is acceptable. Verifying the functionality of the overspeed protection \\nsystem at engine shutdown and/or start-up is also acceptable to show compliance with this regulation’s once -per start-stop cycle requirement. Some engines may routinely not be shut down \\nbetween landings. If the engine is not shutdown between two flights, test of the over-speed protection system is not required but should be accounted for in the SSA. \\n(e) Because some overspeed protection systems provide multiple protection paths, \\nuncertainty that all paths are functional at any given time always exists. Where multiple paths can trigger the overspeed protection system, the applicant should perform a test of a different path for each engine start/stop cycle. Doing so will achieve a complete test of the overspeed system, including electro-mechanical parts, in the minimum number of engine cycles. We recommend that the number of cycles it takes to verify the overspeed protection system be \\nconsistent with the system achieving a 10\\n-4 failure rate —or the probability of failure (per hou r) \\nover the length of time that it takes to complete the number of cycles. If the system meets a 10-4 \\nfailure rate, it will generally be found compliant. \\n(f) If an applicant chooses to implement overspeed protection with a mechanical or \\nhydro-mechanical system, the regulation does not require that the system be tested at each \\nstart/stop cycle. However, the regulation does require that the overspeed protection system’s \\nmechanical parts (not including the electro-mechanical parts) can operate without failure between inspection and maintenance periods. Therefore, we recommend that where a mechanical or hydro mechanical system is used, that applicants provide a rational maintenance interval/inspection plan to ensure that mechanical elements still perform their intended function and protect from a destructive overspeed. \\nb. Other protective functions . \\n(1) The ECS may perform other protective functions, only some of which may be \\nengine functions (others may be aircraft or propeller functions). The integrity of other protective functions provided by the ECS should be consistent with a safety analysis associated with those functions. If those functions are not engine functions, they might not be part of engine \\ncertification. \\n32\\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n        \\n  \\n    \\n \\n  \\n   \\n       \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(2) As ECSs become increasingly integrated into aircraft and propeller systems, they \\nare implementing within the ECS, protective functions previously provided by the aircraft or \\npropeller systems. Examples include: \\n\\uf0b7 Reducing the engine to idle thrust if a thrust reverser deploys; and \\n\\uf0b7 Providing the auto-feather function for the propeller when an engine fails. \\n(3) The reliability and availability of these other protective functions should be \\nconsistent with the top-level hazard assessment of conditions involving these other protective functions. This assessment is usually completed during aircraft certification. For example, if an engine failure with loss of the auto-feather function is catastrophic at the aircraft level —and \\nauto-feather is incorporated into the ECS —the applicant should show for part 23 or 25 \\ninstallations, that an engine failure with loss of the auto-feather function cannot result from a single control system failure. Also, aircraft regulations may require that combinations of control system failures, or engine and control system failures, that lead to a significant engine loss of thrust or power with an associated loss of the auto-feather function have an extremely improbable event rate (10\\n-9 events per engine flight hour). \\n(4) Although these other protective functions can be evaluated as a part of the aircraft \\nlevel SSA, we recommend that applicants evaluate them during the engine certification process \\nand present that as a part of engine certification. If the aircraft level hazard assessment involving these functions is available during engine certification, then coordination between the engine and aircraft certification teams will be smoother. If this coordination does not occur, then although the engine may be certified, it may not be installable at the aircraft level. \\n(5) The ECS safety assessment should include all failure modes of all functions \\nincorporated in the system, including those functions that are added to support aircraft certification. Information on those failure modes will therefore, be properly addressed and passed on to the installer for inclusion in the airframe SSA. Information concerning the frequencies of occurrence of those failure modes is also needed. \\n33\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n \\n \\n        \\n     \\n \\n  \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n     \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 9 . SECTION 33.28(g) - SOFTWARE . \\n9-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(g) reads: \\n“(g) Software. The applicant must design, implement, and verify all associated software to \\nminimize the existence of errors by using a method, approved by the FAA, consistent with the criticality of the performed functions.” \\n9-2. Guidance: Software . \\na. Objective . \\n(1) Applicants should design their software to prevent logic errors that would result in \\nan unacceptable effect on power or thrust or in other unsafe conditions. Because of the nature \\nand complexity of systems containing digital logic, the applicant should develop software using a structured development approach, commensurate with the hazard associated with failure or malfunction of the system in which the digital logic is contained. \\n(2) Applicants may not be able to establish with certainty that the ir software design is \\nwithout error. However, if applicants use the software design appropriate for the criticality of the performed functions, and an approved development method, the software satisfies the requirement to minimize errors. In some installations, the possibility of digital logic errors common to more than one ECS may determine the software level appropriate for the software design. However, we have not required channel- to-channel dissimilar designs when the software \\nis designed as specified in Level A (DO-178B or C ). \\nb. Approved methods . The primary FAA guidance on software methods is found in AC \\n20-115C. In addition, the FAA must also follow FAA order 8110.49. Acceptable methods for developing software comply with the guidelines of RTCA/DO-178C/EUROCAE ED-12C, hereafter referred to as DO-178B. The applicant may also propose alternative methods for developing software. However, any such alternate method is subject to approval by the Administrator. Reference AC 20-171 regarding alternative methods. \\nc. Use of supplements . DO-331, DO-332 and DO-333 are supplements that address \\ncertain software development techniques. Supplements add, delete, or modify objectives, activities, and life cycle data in DO-178C. You should apply the guidance within a particular supplement when you use the addressed technique. Your Plan for Software Aspects of Certification (PSAC) should identify which supplements apply and describe how you intend to \\nuse each applicable supplement. You cannot use supplements as stand-alone documents. Refer to \\nAC20-115C paragraph 8 when using the supplements in conjunction with DO-178C. \\nd. Software levels . \\n(1) The level of software required for certification depends on the criticality of the \\nfunctions it performs. For example, failures resulting in significant thrust or power increases or \\n34\\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n          \\n   \\n        \\n  \\n \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n        \\n      \\n \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\noscillations may be more severe than an engine shutdown. Therefore, consider these failures \\nwhen selecting a given software level. \\n(a) Design, implementation, and verification of software as specified in Level A \\n(DO-178C) is normally needed for turbine engines. \\n(b) For a reciprocating engine EECS, software implemented as specified in Level C \\nis the minimum acceptable requirement. \\n(c) The applicant may choose to evaluate the failure condition criticality of EECS \\nfunctions to determine if Level B or C software would be adequate. The applicant must \\ncoordinate this evaluation with the aircraft designer and the cognizant aircraft ACO during the EEC S development program. \\n(2) Applicants may protect or partition noncritical software from critical software and \\ndesign and implement the noncritical software to a lower level. The applicant must demonstrate the adequacy of the partitioning method as well as the protection and isolation features needed to prevent corruption between the two levels of software. This demonstration should consider whether the protected/partitioned lower software levels are appropriate for any anticipated installations. \\ne. Legacy software . Software developed using DO-178, DO-178A, or DO-178B is \\nreferred to as legacy software. Refer to AC20-115C paragraph 9 when modifying and re-using software approved using DO-178, DO-178A, or DO-178B. \\nf. Onboard or field-loadable software and part number marking . \\n(1) When Field-Loadable Software (FLS) is used in EECS, and the applicant wants to \\nuse electronic part marking for the FLS, the FLS must meet the part marking requirements of § 45.15 (c). The information required, like that for a hardware part number, must be verifiable in the aircraft at any geographic location on the ground. Use the following guidelines and, for additional information, refer to FAA order 8110.49 , Chapter 5, “Approval of Field -Loadable \\nSoftware (FTS),” when onboard or field loading of EEC software and associated Electronic Part \\nMarking is implemented. While the order is directed at the FAA certification engineer, the applicant is advised to much of the following material in 9-2 e. and its subparagraphs based on the Order’s requirements. \\n(2) For software changes, document the software to be loaded through an approved \\ndesign change and a released service bulletin or other appropriate documentation. \\n(3) For an EECS unit with separate part numbers for hardware and software, the \\nsoftware part numbers need not be displayed on the unit as long as they are embedded in the loaded software, and can be verified by electronic means. When new software is loaded into the unit, the verification by electronic means requirement applies and the proper software part number must be verified before the unit is returned to service. \\n35\\n \\n      \\n      \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n  \\n        \\n  \\n \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n \\n      \\n \\n      \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n      \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n     \\n   \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(4) For an EECS unit with only one part number, the one part number represents a \\ncombination of a software and hardware build. Applicants should change or update the unit part number on the nameplate when the new software is loaded. As a portion of this process the software build or version number should be verified before returning the unit to service. \\n(5) For an EECS that will be onboard or field loaded, you cannot use the configuration \\ncontrol system and electronic part marking unless it was approved at the time of engine certification. The drawing system must provide a compatibility table that tabulates the combinations of hardware part numbers and software versions that have been approved by the Administrator. The top-level compatibility table must be under configuration control, and the applicant must update it for each change that affects the hardware and software combination. The \\napplicable service bulletin must define the hardware configurations with which the new software version is compatible. \\n(6) The loading system must be in compliance with the guidelines of DO-178C, \\nSection 2.5.5. If the applicant proposes more than one source for loading, (such as disk, CD or mass storage), all sources must comply with these guidelines. \\n(7) The service bulletin must require verification that the correct software version has \\nbeen loaded after installation on the aircraft. \\ng. Software Change Category . The processes and methods used to change software must \\nnot affect the design assurance level of that software. \\n(1) The determination of a major versus minor type-design change is established in \\n§ 21.93. A change to the software in an ECS may affect the reliability, operational \\ncharacteristics, or other characteristics affecting the airworthiness of the product. Therefore, a \\nchange to the software is normally classified as major. \\n(2) The failure effect of EEC software is always assumed to be at least a major effect \\nbecause an error could result in the total loss of thrust or power to all engines on an aircraft. \\n(3) Refer to FAA order 8110.49, particularly Chapter 11, “ Oversight of Software \\nChange Impact Analysis Used to Classify Software Changes as Major or Minor ” for addit ional \\ninformation. \\nh. Software Changes by Others than the Type Certificate ( TC) Holder . \\n(1) Software changes by someone other than the original TC holder are generally not \\nfeasible. The applicant must address the approval process with the certification authority to determine feasibility. \\n(2) Two types of software changes that are feasible and can be implemented by \\nsomeone other than the original TC holder are : \\n\\uf0b7 Changes to option-selectable software, or \\n36\\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n        \\n    \\n      \\n \\n   \\n    \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n \\n       \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n       \\n     \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n\\uf0b7 Changes to user-modifiable software (UMS). \\n(a) Option-selectable software changes are implemented via precertified logic that \\nuses a method of selection shown not to cause a control malfunction. \\n(b) User-modifiable software is software intended for modification by the aircraft \\noperator without review by the certifying authority, the aircraft applicant, the engine manufacturer, or the equipment vendor. For ECSs, UMS has generally not been applicable. However, if approval of UMS is required, it will be reviewed on a case- by-case basis. \\n1 The necessary guidance for UMS is contained in DO-178C, paragraph \\n2.5.2. The guidance allows non-TC holders to modify the software within the constraints defined \\nby the TC holder if the system has been certified with the provision for software user \\nmodifications. Refer to FAA order 8110.49, particularly Chapter 7, “Approval of Airborne \\nSystems and Equipment Containing User- Modifiable Software (UMS)” for additional \\ninformation. \\n2 To certify an EECS with the provision for software modification by a non-\\nTC holder, the TC holder must (1) provide the necessary information for approval of the design \\nand implementation of a software change, and (2) demonstrate that the necessary precautions have been taken to prevent the user modification, regardless of whether it is implemented correctly, from affecting engine airworthiness. \\n3 When software is changed in a manner not allowed by the TC holder as \\n“user modifiable,” the non -TC holder applicant must comply with all applicable requirements of \\npart 33, particular ly § 33.28, as well as the requirements in part 21, subpart E. Refer to FAA \\norder 8110.49, particularly Chapter 7, “Approval of Airborne Systems and Equipment Containing User- Modifiable Software (UMS)” for additional information. \\n37\\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n           \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n        \\n   \\n   \\n \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 10 . SECTION 33.28(h) – AIRCRAFT-SUPPLIED DATA . \\n10-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(h) reads: \\n“(h) Aircraft-supplied data. Single failures leading to loss, interruption or corruption of aircraft-\\nsupplied data (other than thrust or power command signals from the aircraft), or data shared \\nbetween engines must: \\n(1) Not result in a hazardous engine effect for any engine, and \\n(2) Be detected and accommodated. The accommodation strategy must not result in an \\nunacceptable change in thrust or power or an unacceptable change in engine operating and starting characteristics. The applicant must evaluate and document in the engine installation \\ninstructions the effects of these failures on engine power or thrust, engine operability, and \\nstarting characteristics throughout the flight envelope.” \\n10-2. Guidance: Aircraft-Supplied Data . \\na. Objective . The EECS should be self-sufficient and isolat ed from other aircraft systems, \\nor provide redundancy that enables it to accommodate aircraft data system failures. In the case of \\nloss, interruption, or corruption of aircraft-supplied data, the engine must continue to function in a safe and acceptable manner, without unacceptable effects on thrust or power, hazardous engine effects, or loss of ability to comply with the operating regulations of §§ 33.65 and 33.89, as appropriate. The single failure requirement applies to all dispatchable configurations of the engine control and aircraft air data systems. \\nb. Background . \\n(1) Reciprocating engines with EECS are not considered “conventional reciprocating \\nengines.” For conventional reciprocating engines, magneto ignition and mechanical fuel systems \\ncan accommodate single failures leading to loss, interruption or corruption of aircraft-supplied data or data shared between engines. Therefore, further guidance is not necessary concerning conventional reciprocating engines. \\n(2) For reciprocating engines with EECS, any LOPC event is an unacceptable change \\nin power. Therefore, as required by § 33.28 (h)(2), the applicant should show that the failure of aircraft-supplied data does not cause a LOPC. \\n(3) Aircraft-supplied data failures that result in engine effects less severe than a LOPC, \\nsuch as a minor power loss, are typically considered to be acceptable changes in power. The analyses and the engine installation and operating instructions should identify these types of events along with their effects on engine operation if the effect of the event can be observed by the flight crew. This data can also be used in the powerplant installation safety analysis required during airplane certification to evaluate the impact of these failures on airplane operations. \\n38\\n \\n      \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n      \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(4) Previous regulatory practice preserved the independence of the engine from the \\naircraft. Hence, even with very reliable architectures, such as triplex air data computer (ADC) systems, the ECS provided an independent control that crews could use to safely fly the aircraft should all the ADC signals be lost. With the increased engine-aircraft integration currently occurring in the aviation industry, and with the improvement in reliability and implementation of aircraft-supplied data, the new requirement is that the ECS provide fault accommodation against single failures of aircraft-supplied data for which such accommodation is possible. \\nc. Design Assessment . \\n(1) As part of their compliance plan, applicants should provide an analysis, based on \\ncomponent, system, or engine testing, that shows they adequately evaluated the impact of a \\nfailure of aircraft data on the engine’s performance and operability throughout the aircraft flight \\nenvelope. This failure analysis should address all allowable engine control and aircraft dispatch configurations in which failure of aircraft data in that dispatch configuration would impact ECS response. “Failure of aircraft data ,” includes airplane system failure events that either prevent \\ndata from being transmitted or result in the transmission of incorrect data. This analysis should include: \\n(a) Their evaluation of the engine control responses to aircraft data inputs, \\nincluding an evaluation of the effect on the EECS of faulty and corrupted aircraft-supplied data. \\n(b) An evaluation of the potential for common mode faults affecting operation of \\nmore than one engine in EEC systems intended for installation on multiengine airplanes. The installation and/or the operating instructions should identify data transfers and exchanges between engines, and between the airplane and engines, that could produce common mode faults. \\nExamples of potential common mode faults that the analysis should address include: \\n1 A single erroneous data source transmitted from the aircraft to multiple \\nengines and their associated EEC systems (for example, air data sources or auto throttle \\nsystems), \\n2 Control system operating faults spread through data links between engines \\n(for example, maintenance recording, common bus, cross-talk, or automatic power reserve system), and \\n3 Loss or interruption of aircraft data used by the engine control when that \\nloss or interruption is caused by the failure of another engine. \\n(c) An evaluation of the EECS fault accommodation logic for coverage of aircraft-\\nsupplied data failures. Applicants should conduct testing or analysis on the fault accommodated control mode to establish that the engine operating characteristics comply with all operability requirements of part 33. The applicant may incorporate precautions for addressing common effects in the aircraft system architecture or in the EECS itself. \\n39\\n \\n      \\n       \\n   \\n     \\n \\n \\n     \\n      \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n       \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n        \\n   \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n      \\n      5/23/14\\t AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(2) When the particular aircraft air data failure mode(s) are unknown, the engine \\napplicant should assume typical failure modes for loss of data and erroneous data. The engine applicant should assume that erroneous data is being transmitted to the EECS and identify for the installer the impact of this data on engine operation. \\n(3) The applicant may use a ny number of tools and techniques to assess and to shape \\nthe design of the ECS and its interface with the aircraft data systems. One example is the use of a Fault Accommodation chart and Markov Modeling, wherein applicants define the fault accommodation architecture for the aircraft-supplied data. \\n(4) If the ECS relies entirely on aircraft air data to complete any of its critical control \\nfunctions, then the aircraft air data system becomes an element of the ECS. To maintain compliance to § 33.28, the applicant must require via the installation, or the operating \\ninstructions, or both that: \\n(a)\\t The aircraft air data system is unaffected by a complete loss of aircraft \\ngenerated power (for example, the air data system is backed up by battery power). \\n(b) No common mode faults exist where multiple incorrect, but valid, signals are \\ntransmitted to the EECS (for example, dedicated sensor(s) and pneumatic lines for each air data computer). \\n(5) The ECS’s LOTC/LOPC analysis should also analyze the effects of air data system \\nfailures in all allowable ECS and air data system dispatch configurations. \\n(6) Elements of the ECS, such as a throttle position transducer, may be mounted in the \\naircraft and not part of the engine type design but dedicated to the ECS and powered by it. Such elements are an integral component of the EECS, and are not considered aircraft data. The applicant should include failures in the throttle position sensing system and thrust command system in their engine LOTC/LOPC analysis. \\n(7) When aircraft-supplied data can affect ECS operation, the applicant should address \\nthe effects of faulty and corrupted aircraft-supplied data on the EECS, as applicable, in the SSA or other appropriate documents. \\nd. Accommodation . Even with a redundant, multipath aircraft air data system, the EECS \\nshould incorporate appropriate accommodation features. These features should retain a thrust or \\npower modulation capability for complete loss of all aircraft environmental (i.e., speed, altitude, temperature data) information. The following are examples of possible means of accommodation: \\n(1)\\t Implementation of an alternate mode that is independent of aircraft-supplied data. \\n(2) Dual sources of aircraft-supplied sensor data with local engine sensors providing \\ndata as alternate sources. This local engine sensor can be used to aid in the selection of the \\n40\\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n       \\n    \\n          \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\ncorrect aircraft-supplied data. The local engine sensor used in this selection is often called a \\nvoter. \\n(3) Use of synthesized engine parameters to control or act as voters . When \\nsynthesized parameters are used for control or voting purposes, the SSA should consider the \\nimpact of temperature and other environmental effects on sensors whose data are used in the \\nsynthesis. Also, applicants should assess any data tolerances necessary to correlate the data from the sensors used in the synthesis and the parameters being synthesized. \\n(4) Triple redundant ADC systems that provide the required data. \\ne. Effects on the engine. Applicants should ensure that their ECS system is capable of \\nensuring that the engine provid es the declared minimum rated thrust or power throughout the \\nengine operating envelope. The effects of failures in aircraft-supplied data must be documented in the SSA as described in Chapter 7 of this AC. \\nf. Validation . \\n(1) Applicants should demonstrate by test, analysis, or a combination thereof, that their \\nECS fault accommodation logic continues to successfully manage engine performance when the aircraft air data system is not functional. \\n(2) Applicants should also show that for all dispatchable control modes that involve \\naircraft data, the next single fault in the EECS does not lead to a hazardous engine effect. \\n(3) When the alternate mode is intended to be a dispatchable mode, applicants should \\ndemonstrate that the ECS continues to successfully meet the engine and aircraft certification basis when operating in this alternate mode, and the aircraft air data system is not functional. The objective here is to assure that a dispatchable alternate mode does not lead to a hazardous engine effect when there is a subsequent loss of aircraft air data. The instructions for installation should include characteristics of operation in this alternate mode, even if it is a nondispatchable mode. \\ng. Installation requirements . As a result of increasing levels of integration between \\naircraft systems and ECSs, engine applicants should show that the ir installation instructions \\nprovide guidance with certain aspects of the data interface during the integration of the engine. “Certain aspects” includes ensuring that the engine continues to meet its certification basis when \\ninstalled. This means that the engine applicant should state in the engine installation instructions that the installer is responsible for ensuring that: \\n(1) The software in the data path to the EECS is at a level consistent with how the \\naircraft data is used by the EECS , as described and analyzed in the EECS’s SSA , and \\n(2) The impact of the engine responses are included in the aircraft ’s SSA as the data \\npath may include other aircraft equipment, such as aircraft thrust management computers, or other avionics equipment, and \\n41\\n \\n      \\n         \\n  \\n \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n   \\n       \\n   \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n      \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(3) The effects of faulty or corrupted aircraft-supplied data on the EECS are addressed \\nin the aircraft SSA, and \\n(4) Those sensors and equipment involved in delivering information to the EECS \\ncontinue to operate properly when exposed to EMI, HIRF and lightning, and \\n(5) The reliability level for the aircraft-supplied data is no worse than that used as part \\nof the EEC’s SSA and LOTC/LOPC analysis, and \\n(6) Any assumptions made during the ECS design assessment regarding the reliability \\nor configuration of the aircraft systems are appropriate, and thus the results of the evaluation of \\nerroneous aircraft data as documented in the SSA are also appropriate. \\nh. Thrust and power command signals . \\n(1) Thrust and power command signals sent from the aircraft are unique and are not \\nsubject to the regulations of § 33.28(h). \\n(2) Some aircraft thrust or power command systems are configured to move the engine \\nthrust or power levers or transmit an electronic signal to command a thrust or power change. When so configured, the ECS merely responds to the command and changes engine thrust or power as appropriate. In these cases, other than input range or data validity checks, the ECS should not attempt to differentiate between correct or erroneous throttle or power lever commands. For EEC systems in which the throttle or power lever command system is not included in the EEC system design, do not include thrust and power command signals sent from the aircraft in the evaluation required by § 33.28(h)(2). \\n(3) For EEC systems in which the power lever command is included in the EEC \\nsystem design to be certificated under part 33, we recommend including the thrust and power command signals in the analysis. \\n(4) In both moving and non-moving throttle (or power lever) configurations, the \\ninstaller should ensure that a proper functional hazard analysis is performed on the aircraft system involved in generating engine thrust or power commands. The installer should also ensure that the system meets the appropriate aircraft functional hazard assessment safety related regulations. This should be shown at aircraft certification. However, failures in the throttle position sensing system and thrust command system must be included in the LOTC/LOPC analysis of the engine as defined in the LOTC/LOPC analysis system description. \\n42\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n       \\n  \\n    \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 11. SECTION 33.28(i) – AIRCRAFT-SUPPLIED ELECTRICAL POWER \\n11-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(i) reads: “ (i) Aircraft-supplied electrical power. (1) The applicant \\nmust design the engine control system so that the loss, malfunction, or interruption of electrical \\npower supplied from the aircraft to the engine control system will not result in any of the following: \\n(i) A hazardous engine effect, or \\n(ii) The unacceptable transmission of erroneous data. \\n(2) When an engine dedicated power source is required for compliance with paragraph (i)(1) of \\nthis section, its capacity should provide sufficient margin to account for engine operation below \\nidle where the engine control system is designed and expected to recover engine operation \\nautomatically. \\n(3) The applicant must identify and declare the need for, and the characteristics of, any \\nelectrical power supplied from the aircraft to the engine control system for starting and operating \\nthe engine, including transient and steady state voltage limits, in the engine installation instructions. \\n(4) Low voltage transients outside the power supply voltage limitations declared in \\nparagraph (i)(3) of this section must meet the requirements of paragraph (i)(1) of this section. The engine control system must be capable of resuming normal operation when aircraft-supplied power returns to within the declared limits.” \\n11-2. Guidance: Aircraft-Supplied EECS Electrical Power. \\na. The most common means of providing electrical power to an EECS has been an engine-\\nmounted alternator. An EECS dedicated engine-mounted alternator is not subject to the typical \\ninterruptions and power transients present in the aircraft power systems. In addition, this configuration is typically single-electric fault tolerant including common cause/mode electric fault tolerant. However, other options do exist, and are discussed below. \\n(1) Batteries. Batteries are not generally an acceptable aircraft-supplied power source, \\nparticularly for turbine engine aircraft, as they are unable to satisfy the reliability needs for the EECS. For reciprocating engines, however, an ECS dedicated battery may be acceptable. If an applicant proposes a battery as an EECS dedicated power source, the applicant should in the \\nengine installation instructions, identify battery health, status, and maintenance requirements. \\n(2) Self-contained electrical power systems . This type of system is an integral part of \\nthe engine design. The self-contained reference may be only applicable to the critical functions \\nof the ECS. It is both functionally and physically isolated from the aircraft electrical power system. This is acknowledging that there are means other than an alternator that may be used. However, an engine driven alternator based system does fit into this type of system. \\n43\\n \\n      \\n     \\n    \\n \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n      \\n        \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n        \\n \\n  \\n      \\n \\n     \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(a) A self-contained system is considered part of the EECS, and applicants should \\ninclude the predicted failure event rate of the self-contained system in the EECS SSA. \\n(b) A self-contained system may not require backup electrical power. However, if \\naircraft power is a backup power source, then applicants should provide detailed electrical system interface requirements in the engine installation instructions. \\n(c) Applicants should also show in their compliance plan, that abnormalities in the \\naircraft power system cannot cause the EECS to behave abnormally. The applicant does not have \\nto include the predicted failure event rate of this backup power system in the EECS SSA because \\nwe have not typically allowed credit toward achieving system reliability based on backup power from the aircraft. \\n(3) Aircraft power b us. If a power source supplies power to both the aircraft main \\npower bus and the EECS, the source may be “independent” for purposes of evaluating EECS \\npower sources, but further inquiry is needed. The determination is made by looking at what is dedicated to the EECS, and what is not. For example, if the EECS draws its power from the aircraft main power bus, the power is aircraft bus supplied power and the EECS does not have a self-contained engine power source. However, if a winding on an alternator with dual windings provides only the EECS with power, the dedicated winding is a self-contained engine power source, even if the other winding provides power to the main power bus. In this instant the EECS power source would be “independent ,” even though the alternator supplies both. \\nb. Design architecture analysis . \\n(1) Dedicated aircraft power . \\n(a) Applicants should ensure that the design of any engine dedicated power source \\nwould provide sufficient power to allow the ECS to continue functioning during any anticipated engine recovery event. For example, when autolight is an intended ECS function, the ECS should have sufficient power to continue operation during an automatic relight after unintended shutdown. ECS independence from aircraft power during restart when the engine is windmilling, is not always required. For example the ignition system is often powered by the aircraft electrical system. \\n(b) The applicant should also ensure that the ECS design accounts for any \\nanticipated variations in aircraft power availability, such as those due to temperature variations, manufacturing tolerances, or idle speed variations. \\n(2) Failure of aircraft-supplied power . The applicant should show through analysis, \\nor bench testing that the EECS continues to function properly during and after a failure or interruption of an aircraft-supplied power source at any point within the declared engine-operating envelope. The applicant’s analysis of the ECS design architecture should identify all requirements for engine-dedicated and aircraft-supplied power sources. The analysis should also include the sources of power and the effects of losing these sources. If the engine depends on \\n44\\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n \\n        \\n  \\n    \\n \\n  \\n       \\n    \\n \\n          \\n    \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\naircraft-supplied power for any operational functions, the analysis should also define the aircraft-\\nsupplied power requirements. \\nc. Aircraft-supplied power system(s) . Applicants should consider the single bus failure \\nrate. \\n(1) Failure of a single bus . A failure of one of multiple aircraft buses is not considered \\na loss of aircraft power if the buses are independent and power the EECS separately. Therefore, a \\nbackup source could be an alternate bus, such as an essential bus, that is independent, isolated from the bus serving as the primary power source, and services only electrical loads required for continued safe operation. \\n(2) Installation instructions . The engine installation instructions may reference a \\ndetailed wiring diagram with the information. If it does, the wiring diagram itself should not need to be issued as a part of the engine installation and/or operating instructions. \\n(3) Failure event rate . If required to meet the declared LOTC/LOPC failure rate, the \\napplicant should include in the installation instructions the maximum allowable failure event rate for the aircraft electrical power system, recalling that the total EECS failure event rate, including the aircraft power source, must remain within the EECS SSA criteria for full-up and degraded systems. This inclusion of failure rate data insures that, as installed, the ECS still satisfies the \\nallowable rates. \\n(4) Aircraft as primary power source . If aircraft-supplied power, such as an aircraft \\nbus and battery system, is used as the primary power source, then the EECS should have an isolated backup power source. This backup power source can be integral to the engine EECS or \\nprovided by the airplane. \\n(a) Separation of EECS power and aircraft power. Aircraft electrical power \\ngenerators or battery systems certified with the engine should be physically and functionally \\nseparate from the primary EECS power system to avoid any interaction and potential for common cause or common mode failures. \\n(b) Backup power source monitoring. The applicant should provide ICA and \\nprovisions for system monitoring. System monitoring will ensure that the backup system is capable of powering the EECS for continued safe flight. For example, a battery system should incorporate provisions for charge level monitoring and the ICA should include maintenance procedures to ensure that the charge level is adequate to power the EECS. \\n(c) Backup power, such as alternate buses, essential buses, or battery systems. We \\nrecommend that the engine installation, or operating instructions, or both, specify the following to ensure that the installer does not violate any of the assumptions in the EECS SSA: \\n1 A requirement that the backup system be physically and functionally \\nseparate from the primary EECS power system, and \\n45\\n \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n        \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n        \\n        \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n    \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n2 The interface and reliability requirements needed for the airplane system to \\nmeet overall EECS objectives, and \\n3 System charge level or power requirements and health monitoring \\nrequirements to ensure that power or charge level is available, and \\n4 For battery systems, a requirement to isolate the backup battery system from \\nthe engine starting battery system, and \\n5 For battery systems, a requirement that the battery capacity must allow for \\nengine operation to be maintained in excess of the time required for the primary flight displays. \\nd. Aircraft-supplied power reliability . \\n(1) Power reliability values . The applicant should include in the engine installation \\ninstructions all aircraft-supplied power reliability values that they used in their system analyses. This is to ensure that the installer does not violate any of the assumptions in the EECS SSA. \\n(2) Inclusion of aircraft power effects. Applicants should include in the EECS SSA \\nall events where the aircraft-supplied power is used in any architecture and aircraft power faults or failures can contribute to LOTC/LOPC or hazardous engine effects. \\n(3) Credit for backup power . Aircraft-supplied power has typically been provided to \\naccommodate the loss of the engine dedicated power source. However, we will review \\nLOTC/LOPC allowance and any impact on the SSA for the use of aircraft-supplied power as the sole power source for an engine control backup system or as a backup power source on a case\\xad\\nby-case basis. If the engine control can operate in the presence of aircraft power bus transfers, \\nthen the use of aircraft power as a backup may be acceptable. \\n(4) Without dedicated power source . In some system architectures, compliance with \\nthe regulations may not require an engine dedicated power source. Two examples are mixed \\nelectronic and hydro-mechanical systems, and EEC systems that could support a critical fly- by\\xad\\nwire flight control system. Both are discussed below. \\n(a) Mixed electronic and hydromechanical systems . \\n1 These systems consist of a primary electronic single channel and a full \\ncapability hydromechanical backup system independent of electrical power. A full capability \\nhydromechanical control system meets all part 33 regulations and does not depend on aircraft \\npower. In this architecture, a loss or interruption of aircraft-supplied power is accommodated by transferring control to the hydromechanical system. \\n2 Transition from the electronic to the hydromechanical control system is \\naddressed under § 33.28 (c). For these systems, the applicant should show that the transition from the electronic-powered mode to the mechanical control mode can be performed without the \\naircraft-supplied power and without the occurrence of an LOTC/LOPC. \\n46\\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n \\n         \\n \\n   \\n  \\n       \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n      \\n      \\n        \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(b) EECS powered by an aircraft power system that could support a critical fly- by\\xad\\nwire flight control system . \\n1 These systems may be acceptable as the sole source of power for an EECS. \\nIn this example, the engine installation instructions should state that a detailed design review and safety analysis must be conducted to identify latent failures and common cause failures that could result in the loss of all electrical power. The instructions should also state that any emergency power sources must be known to be operational at the beginning of the flight. \\n2 Any emergency power sources should be isolated from the normal electrical \\npower system so that the emergency power system will be available no matter what happens to the normal generated power system. If batteries are the emergency power source, the applicant \\nshould show that the flight crew can determine battery condition prior to flight, and that battery \\ncapacity is sufficient to ensure exhaustion will not occur before the airplane lands. This will ensure that appropriate reliability assumptions are provided to the installer. \\ne. Aircraft-supplied power quality . \\n(1) Requirements . When aircraft electrical power is necessary for operation of the \\nECS, the engine installation instructions must contain the ECS ’s electrical power supply quality \\nrequirements. This applies to any of the configurations listed above or to any new or novel configurations that use aircraft-supplied power. These quality requirements should include steady state and transient under-voltage and over-voltage limits for the equipment. RTCA/DO\\xad160/EUROCAE ED-14 provides additional information on setting power input standards. If used, the applicant should identify any exceptions to the power quality standards cited for the \\ncategory of equipment specified. \\n(2) Low voltage transients . We recognize that the electrical or electronic components \\nof the ECS, when operated on aircraft-supplied power, may cease to operate during some low \\nvoltage aircraft power supply conditions beyond those required to sustain normal operation. When the ECS is operating on aircraft-supplied power, if low voltage aircraft power supply conditions are below those required to sustain normal operation, the electrical or electronic components of the ECS may not function as intended. However, during these transients, EECS operation must not per regulation, result in a hazardous engine effect. Further, low voltage transients outside the control system’s declared capability should not: \\n(a) Cause permanent ECS loss of function, or \\n(b) Result in inappropriate system operation, or \\n(c) Cause the engine to exceed any operational limits, or \\n(d) Cause the transmission of unacceptable erroneous data. \\n47\\n \\n      \\n     \\n \\n    \\n   \\n      \\n \\n       \\n  \\n   \\n \\n        \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nf. Power recovery . \\n(1) Power recovery from voltage transients does not usually apply to systems powered \\nby ECS dedicated PMA/PMG systems. However, aircraft supplied power does have the potential \\nto have low voltage transient. Impact from these type of transients has been shown to affect ECS using aircraft power for backup power even when they are being powered by a PMA/PMG. The applicant should demonstrate the ECS reaction to aircraft power low voltage transients. The following cases should also be tested if the system could be operating on aircraft power: \\n(a) Recovery from low voltage . When aircraft power recovers from a low-voltage \\ncondition, the ECS must resume normal operation. Applicants should include in the engine installation or operating instructions the time interval associated with this recovery. \\n(b) Aircraft low power supply condition . These conditions may lead to engine \\nshutdown or an engine condition that is not automatically recoverable. In these cases, the engine should be capable of being restarted. Also, applicants should include in the operating instructions any special flight crew procedures for executing an engine restart during such conditions. \\n(c) Low voltage transients effects . These transients can be associated with \\napplication of electrical loads that could cause an interruption in voltage or a decay in voltage level below that required for proper control functioning. Therefore, the applicant should consider the effects of any aircraft electrical bus-switching transients or power transients in the engine installation or operating instructions. \\n(2) All engine out restart . During certain aircraft operations, such as low engine speed \\nand in-flight engine restarts, aircraft electrical power is generally used to operate the ECS. \\nHowever, operationally, battery power may have to suffice. If battery power is required to meet a \\nlow engine speed or “all engine out” restart requirement, the engine applicant should define the battery power requirements and verify them via test. Those power requirements will thereafter, be available to the installer in the engine installation instructions and will ensure that the EECS will generally have sufficient power during any in-flight engine restart(s). \\ng. Effects on the engine. \\n(1) Change of control mode . When loss of aircraft power results in a change in engine \\ncontrol mode, the control mode transition must meet the requirements of § 33.28(c). \\n(2) Acceptable loss of aircraft electrical power . For some engine control functions \\nthat rely exclusively upon aircraft-supplied electrical power, the loss of electrical power may still be acceptable. Acceptability is based on evaluation of the change in engine operating characteristics, current experience with similar designs, or the accommodation designed into the control system. \\n(a) Engine operating characteristics . These are acceptable if the engine is still \\ncapable of complying with all of the rules and does not operate in a manner unexpected by the \\npilot. \\n48\\n \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n \\n      \\n      \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n     \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(b) Similar designs . Examples include the ignition systems and some performance \\nenhancing systems (see (3) below) that are typically powered by aircraft. \\n(c) Accommodation . This refers to whether the loss of the function is \\naccommodated by automatic control features that result in an unnoticeable operational change. \\n(3) Aircraft powered functions . Examples of engine control functions that have \\ntraditionally relied on aircraft power include \\n(a) Engine start and ignition, \\n(b) Thrust reverser deployment, \\n(c) Anti-icing (engine probe heat), \\n(d) Fuel shut-off, \\n(e) Over-speed protection systems, and \\n(f) Noncritical functions that are primarily performance enhancement functions \\nthat, if inoperative, do not affect the safe operation of the engine. \\nh. Validation . The applicant should demonstrate the effects of loss of aircraft-supplied \\nelectrical power by engine test, system validation test, bench test, or combination thereof. \\ni. New and novel design concepts. Technological advances in electrical power-\\ngenerating components and in the associated systems may allow for new and novel design \\nconcepts to meet the requirements of § 33.28(i). For example, dual use alternators or use of an essential battery, are concepts that until recently were not considered successful. Therefore, if an applicant has a new or novel design concept, we recommend contacting the responsible certification office early to develop an appropriate compliance plan. \\n49\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n \\n     \\n   \\n     \\n           \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n      \\n     \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n     \\n   \\n    AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 12 . SECTION 33.28(j) – AIR PRESSURE SIGNAL . \\n12-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(j) reads: \\n“(j) Air Pressure Signal. The applicant must consider the effects of blockage or leakage of the \\nsignal lines on the engine control system as part of the System Safety Assessment of paragraph (e) of this section and must adopt the appropriate design precautions.” \\n12-2. Guidance: Section 33.28(j) covers ingress of foreign matter (for example, sand, dust, \\nwater, or insects) that could result in blockage of the lines and adversely affect engine operation. Lines used for measuring the static pressure in the compressor of turbine engines can suffer from two predominate failure modes: signal lines are either blocked by frozen water (leading to a loss of power or to failures to detect changes in the engine static pressure) or they fail to open or \\ndevelop a leak, thereby leading to a loss of powe r. Each are discussed separately. \\na. Signal lines can be blocked by frozen water. We recommend applicants take \\nprecautions, such as: \\n(1) Use of protected openings, \\n(2) Filters, \\n(3) Drains for water, \\n(4) Effective geometry of plumbing to aid in draining, \\n(5) Appropriate plumbing line inside diameter to aid in draining, \\n(6) Appropriate bleed hole and drain hole sizing, \\n(7) Heating the lines to prevent freezing of condensed water, and \\n(8) Corrosion resistant features. \\nb. Signal lines can also fail to open or develop a leak. Precautions might in this case, \\ninclude: \\n(1) Enhanced support of the plumbing lines to prevent loosening or fracture due to \\nvibration or handling damage during maintenance, \\n(2) Special design precautions to prevent loosening of the fittings, and \\n(3) Appropriate plumbing line size for durability. \\nc. In addressing system failure modes, the applicant should consider both pressure line \\nfailure modes in paragraphs a. and b. above independently and in combination. \\n50\\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 13. SECTION 33.28(k) – AUTOMATIC AVAILABILITY AND CONTROL \\nOF ENGINE POWER FOR A 30-SECOND OEI RATING . \\n13-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(k) reads: \\n“(k) Automatic availability and control of engine power for 30-second OEI rating. Rotorcraft \\nengines having a 30-second OEI rating must incorporate means, or a provision for a means, for \\nautomatic availability and automatic control of the 30-second OEI power within its operating limitations.” \\n13-2. Guidance: Using a 30-second OEI rating during flight may create high pilot workload. \\nTherefore, the rating should be applied and controlled automatically by the ECS, other than to \\nterminate it. Until terminated, the software should automatically prevent the engine from \\nexceeding its limits, specified in the engine\\'s TCDS and associated with this rating. Because the \\n30-second OEI rating may use almost all the available margin in the engine design, exceeding the rating limits would likely result in engine failure. \\na. The required automatic control of the 30-second OEI power should eliminate the need \\nto monitor engine parameters, such as output shaft torque or power, output shaft speed, gas generator speed, and gas path temperatures. This should free the pilot to focus on flying the aircraft. Such means for automatic control within the operating limitations must be effective during normal and abnormal operations. \\nb. When selected, the means required by § 33.28(k) must automatically govern the engine \\nto its 30-second OEI power rating. The applicant should provide information in it’s installation \\ninstructions, on methods to ensure that engine limiter settings do not prevent the engine from \\nreaching the 30-second OEI power. These limiter settings may include engine speed, measured \\ngas temperature and fuel flow. Pay particular attention to take-off conditions with a cold-soaked engine. \\n51\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n     \\n \\n  AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 14. SECTION 33 .28(L) – ENGINE SHUT DOWN MEANS . \\n14-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(l) reads: \\n“(l) Engine Shut Down Means. Means must be provided for shutting down the en gine rapidly.” \\n14-2. Guidance: Engine shut down means . This requirement is usually met through a fuel shut\\xad\\noff valve in the fuel metering system of the engine control. The pilot usually activates the valve \\nvia a switch or lever. In some applications, however, the valve is not part of the engine control. \\nIn these cases, the applicant should indicate in the installation manual that a pilot initiated means for rapid shutdown of the engine must be provided by the installer. The engine manufacturer and the installer should coordinate a mutually acceptable means. The issues to be addressed include the acceptability of the valve’s location and response time, its compatibility with the ECS, and \\nthe pilot’s capability to rapidly select this function. In addition, the valve may have reliability, \\nenvironmental, fire, or other requirements. \\n52\\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n       \\n   \\n  \\n      \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n    AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 15. SECTION 33 .28(M) - PROGRAMMABLE LOGIC DEVICES (PLDS) . \\n15-1. Rule Text . Section 33.28(m) reads: \\n“(m) Programmable logic devices. The development of programmable logic devices using digital \\nlogic or other complex design technologies must provide a level of assurance for the encoded logic, which is commensurate with the hazard associated with the failure or malfunction of the systems in which the devices are located. The applicant must design, implement, and verify all associated logic to minimize the existence of errors by using a method, approved by the FAA, that is consistent with the criticality of the performed function.” \\n15-2. Guidance: Previously, PLDs were the devices of greatest concern in the family of devices \\ncomplex enough to require additional certification scrutiny. Further, the FAA had not yet \\nrecognized RTCA/DO-254 as a method for showing compliance. So, the FAA issued AC 20\\xad\\n152, RTCA/DO-254, Design Assurance Guidance for Airborne Electronic Hardware, which limits the scope of the application of DO-254. AC 20- 152 remains “current guidance.” However, \\nAC 33.28-1A supplements and reinforces the guidance in AC 20-152, and provides guidance specific to engine controls. Applicants should be aware that the broader scope of AEH, covered by AC 20-152, is verified at the installation level. \\na. Objective . Applicants should design their logic to minimize logic errors that would \\nresult in an unacceptable effect on power or thrust or in other unsafe conditions. Because of the nature and complexity of systems containing digital logic, the applicant should develop PLDs using a structured development approach. The applicant’s approach must be commensurate with \\nthe hazard associated with failure or malfunction of the system in which the digital logic is contained. Applicants may not be able to establish with certainty that their PLD design is without \\nerror. However, if the applicant uses the hardware design assurance level appropriate for the \\ncriticality of the performed functions and an approved development method, the logic satisfies the requirement to minimize errors. \\nb. Approved methods . The primary FAA guidance on PLDs is found in AC 20-152. \\nAddition information can be found in FAA order 8110.105 CHG 1, Simple and Complex Electronic Hardware Approval Guidance. Methods for developing PLDs, compliant with the guidelines of document AC 20-152, are generally acceptable. The applicant may, however, also propose alternative methods for developing PLDs. \\nc. Level of hardware design assurance . \\n(1) Determining the appropriate hardware design assurance level depends on failure \\nmodes and consequences of those failures. For example, failures resulting in significant thrust or power increases or oscillations may be more severe than an engine shutdown. Therefore, the applicant should consider the possibility of these types of failures when selecting a given hardware design assurance level. \\n(2) In multiple engine installations, the possibility of digital logic errors common to \\nmore than one ECS may determine the criticality of the hardware design assurance level. \\n53\\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n \\n     \\n  5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nHowever, the FAA has not required dissimilar designs when the PLD is designed as specified in \\nLevel A (DO-254). \\n(3) The criticality of control functions on other aircraft may be different, and therefore, \\na different level of hardware design assurance may be acceptable. For example, in the case of a \\nreciprocating engine in a single engine aircraft, level C (DO-254) hardware design assurance has been found acceptable. \\n(4) If the criticality level is higher in subsequent installations, the applicant should \\nmeet all the requirements for the higher hardware design assurance level. \\n54\\n \\n     \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n \\n     \\n       \\n        \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n       \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n  AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nCHAPTER 16. OTHER CONSIDERATIONS: ENGINE, PROPELLER, AND AIRCRAFT\\n \\nSYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENGINE, \\nPROPELLER, AND AIRCRAFT CERTIFICATION ACTIVITIES\\n \\n16-1. Systems Integration . \\na. Two forms of systems integration are discussed. First, aircraft or propeller functions \\nintegrated into EECS hardware and software, and second, integrating engine functions into \\naircraft systems. One version of systems integration involves the integration of aircraft or propeller functions (i.e. those that have traditionally not been considered engine control functions) into the EECS hardware and software. The other version involves aircraft systems performing functions traditionally considered part of the ECS. These are addressed in paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b), respectively, below. \\nb. We encourage applicants with highly integrated systems to develop an EEC System \\nIntegration Certification Plan (SICP). A SICP should identify the tasks unique to integration. You should include in it’s SICP a clear definition of the respective certification tasks of the \\nengine, propeller, and aircraft manufacturers. The applicant should also develop it’s plan during \\nclose coordination with the associated engine, propeller, and aircraft certification authorities. The SICP may provide valuable information to the installer and should be provided to the installer for their use. It may address the following types of integration: \\n(1) Aircraft or propeller functions integrated into the ECS or EECS . \\n(a) Examples of aircraft or propeller functions integrated into the ECS include \\nthrust reverser control systems, propeller speed governors, ATTCS, and APR System. When \\nintegrating aircraft or propeller functions into the ECS, the EECS failure cases related to the \\nintegration need to be included in the Aircraft Level SSA by the installer. Although aircraft functions incorporated into the ECS may be reviewed at engine certification, the acceptability of the safety analysis involving these functions will be determined at aircraft certification. \\n(b) The EECS may be configured to contain parts or all of the aircraft system’s \\nfunctionality. Thrust reverser control systems are an example of including only part of the functionality in the EECS. In those control systems, the aircraft is configured with separate switches and logic (i.e., independent from the EECS) as part of the thrust reverser control system. This separation of reverser control system elements and logic provides an architectural means to limit the criticality of the functions provided by the EECS. \\n(c) One example of configuring the ECS to contain all functionality of an aircraft \\nsystem: an ECS designed to fully govern propeller speed in turboprop aircraft. Here, the engine applicant may need to configure the ECS logic to feather a propeller when an engine fails. Failure of the prop to feather may result in catastrophic aircraft failure as the result of excessive drag. Another example is an ATTCS or APR in turbofan aircraft. If an engine fails during takeoff, the engine applicant may need to configure the logic to increase the thrust of the remaining engine(s). Both examples indicate that criticality is not limited, since ECS failure \\n55\\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n        \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n        \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\ncould result in loss of aircraft. Both examples also involve aircraft functionality that would \\nreceive significant review during aircraft certification. \\n(d) When functions like these are integrated into the ECS so that they render an \\nECS critical, the applicant should ensure that no single failure (including common cause/mode) \\ncould cause the critical failure condition. For example, exposing the EECS to overheat should not cause both an engine shutdown and failure of the propeller to feather. \\n(2) Integration of engine control functions into aircraft systems . \\n(a) Applicants may use aircraft systems to implement a significant number of ECS \\nfunctions. For example, integrated flight and ECSs, such as those integrated in to avionics, may \\nbe used to govern engine speed, and in helicopters, rotor speed, rotor pitch angle, and rotor tilt \\nangle. A special case of this type of implementation is via an Integrated Modular Avionics \\nsystem as defined in RTCA/DO-297. Implementation of a FADEC in an Integrated Modular Avionics system will require special considerations. The engine applicant needs to coordinate this with the Engine and Propeller Directorate. In these examples, we may require aircraft \\nsystems be used during engine certification. If so, then the engine applicant should specify the EECS requirements in the engine installation instructions and show that those EECS requirements are adequate to protect the engine from any hazardous engine effects. \\n(b) An example of limited integration is an engine control that receives a torque \\noutput demand signal from the aircraft and responds by changing the engine’s fuel flow and other variables to meet that demand. Then the EECS, which is part of the type design, provides all the functionality required to safely operate the engine as required by part 33 or other applicable specifications. \\n16-2. Certification Activities . \\na. Engine certification . All hardware and software that reside on the engine, including \\nthose that provide aircraft or propeller functions, must meet the requirements of §§ 33.28(b), (f), \\n(g)and (m). This should include environmental testing of all components and software, and \\nquality assurance of the software that performs both the engine and aircraft functions. The EECS SSA and other analyses (aircraft power, fault accommodation, etc.) that the engine applicant submits for engine certification, should address only engine functions performed by the EECS. The aircraft and propeller functions do not need to be evaluated in the EECS SSA unless the functions affect engine operation or reliability. \\nb. Aircraft or propeller certification . \\n(1) The aircraft or propeller certification program should include all hardware \\nand software substantiation requirements for the hardware and software that reside on the aircraft or propeller, including those that perform engine control functions. The applicant should also include environmental testing of all components and software, and quality assurance of the software that performs both engine and airplane functions. \\n56\\n \\n      \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n        \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n      \\n       \\n    \\n      \\n      \\n         \\n \\n      \\n \\n       \\n \\n      \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n      \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(2) To satisfy aircraft requirements, such as §§ XX.901, XX.903 and XX .1309, the \\napplicant should analyze the consequences to the aircraft of ECS failures. Together with the \\naircraft applicant, the engine applicant should ensure that the ECS software and AEH levels and safety and reliability objectives are consistent with aircraft certification requirements. \\nc. Interface Definition and System Responsibilities . \\n(1) The applicant should identify in the appropriate documents, e.g., EEC SICP or an \\nInterface Control Document (ICD), the system responsibilities as well as interface definitions for the functions, the hardware and the software. The se interfaces are typically between the engine, \\npropeller, and aircraft systems. \\n(2) The engine, propeller, and aircraft documents should include: \\n(a) Requirements and categorization of the severity of the effects of a failure \\ncondition (that may be based on engine, propeller, and aircraft considerations ), \\n(b) Fault accommodation strategies, \\n(c) Maintenance strategies, \\n(d) The software and airborne electronic hardware levels (per function if \\nnecessary), and \\n(e) The reliability objectives for: \\n1 LOTC/LOPC and MPL events, and \\n2 Transmission of faulty parameters. \\n(f) The environmental requirements including the degree of protection against \\nlightning or other electromagnetic effects (for example, level of induced voltages that can be \\nsupported at the interfaces), \\n(g) Engine, propeller, and aircraft interface data and characteristics, and \\n(h) Aircraft power supply requirements and characteristics (if relevant). \\nd. Distribution of compliance tasks . Engine, propeller, and aircraft applicants often share \\naircraft propulsion system certification tasks. This is particularly true for aircraft propulsion systems equipped with electronic controls. Therefore, applicants sharing aircraft propulsion system certification tasks should identify how these tasks are distributed between themselves. They should also include this distribution in their compliance plan(s). For example, the EEC SICP should list each task related to the EECS certification, identifying what each applicant should accomplish. The plan should likewise, address all analyses and tests required for EECS \\ncertification, also identifying what each applicant should accomplish.

This will ensure that all certification responsibilities are fully understood by each \\napplicant, thereby avoiding certification delays. \\n(1) An EECS controlling the engine and propeller is a good example. \\n(a) The engine certification would address all general requirements such as \\nsoftware quality assurance procedures, EMI, HIRF and lightning protection levels; and effects of \\nloss of aircraft-supplied power. The engine certification would also address the safety aspects for \\nthe engine functions (for example, safety analysis, rate for LOTC/LOPC events, and effect of loss of aircraft-supplied data). The fault accommodation logic affecting the control of the engine will be reviewed at that time. \\n(b) Similarly, propeller certification would address the propeller function s. The \\nfunctions and characteristics that the propeller applicant defines that are to be provided by the ECS would normally need to be refined by flight test. The propeller applican t would ensure that \\nthese functions and characteristics, provided for use during the engine certification program, define an airworthy propeller configuration, even if they have not yet been refined. \\n(2) An aircraft computer performing the functions for the control of the engine is also a \\ngood example. \\n(a) The aircraft certification would address all general requirements, such as \\nsoftware quality assurance procedures, EMI, HIRF, and lightning protection levels, and functional aspects for the aircraft functions. \\n(b) The engine certification would address the functional aspects for the engine \\nfunctions (for example, safety analysis, rate for LOTC/LOPC events, and effect of loss of aircraft-supplied data). The fault accommodation logic affecting the control of the engine would also be reviewed at that time. \\ne. Design change control . The EEC SICP should describe the design change control \\nsystem the applicant established to support post-certification activity. This design change system should ensure that changes to any control element integrated into the EECS are evaluated by all design approval holders of that integrated system. \\n58\\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n   AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\nAPPENDIX 1 .

RE CIPROCATING ENGINE EECS SSAs \\nA reliability and safety analysis can show that the applicant’s system design meets its intended \\npurpose. Two key terms that are used when evaluating system safety are “single -fault tolerant” \\nand “unsafe condition.” Refer to chapter 11 of this AC for a discussion of ECS failures and, in \\nparticular, the subject of single-fault tolerance. \\na. Unsafe condition . Engine power loss events are not typically considered unsafe \\nconditions when evaluating airplane safety. However, if the frequency of these events is excessive relative to the safety objectives of the intended application, then they may be considered unsafe conditions. Consequently, engine power losses and shutdowns are included in \\nthe following failure conditions and categories that are considered unsafe conditions for \\nreciprocating engines: \\n(1) Destructive events (DE). \\n(2) Excessive number of LOPC events. \\n(3) Excessive number of MPL events. \\nb. Continued operations \\n(1) Section 33.28 does not specifically address continued operations when faults are \\npresent in the EECS. However, service experience indicates that to be economically feasible, \\nEEC S-equipped engines must be permitted to operate for limited time periods with faults present \\nin the system (that is, permitted to operate in a degraded state). In addition, a thorough system \\nsafety analysis includes all the components of the control system, including the mechanical components. \\n(2) To address these issues as well as meet the intent of the rule, the FAA has \\ndeveloped a method for demonstrating compliance for reciprocating engines that allows for operation with certain faults (that is, in a degraded state). This method consists of an ECS safety analysis with both quantitative and qualitative elements. The quantitative element compares the predicted number of failure events of the electrical or electronic components, with established criteria that represents unsafe conditions. Both full-up and degraded configurations are evaluated, but those degraded system configurations that are found acceptable are limited to 20 \\nhours of operation. Mechanical component reliability is evaluated through the test and analyses \\nrequired by §§ 33.19, 33.49, and 33.53. The qualitative elements provide an evaluation of the entire ECS. \\n(3) Instead of addressing all forms and levels of safety analyses, the FAA has \\ndeveloped a method for demonstrating compliance that meets the intent of § 33.28(e) and ensures an acceptable level of safety. The applicant may use a different method of showing \\nA3-4\\n \\n      \\n      \\n  \\n \\n          \\n \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n       \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n      \\n             \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n     \\n         \\n       \\n      \\n           \\n       \\n  \\n         \\n    \\n \\n    5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\ncompliance. Alternative methods should be presented to the FAA for review and approval as \\nearly in the project as possible. \\n(4) The applicant may submit an EECS SSA to comply with § 33.28. The method of \\nshowing compliance described in this appendix allows for FAA approval of time-limited flight \\noperations with certain reciprocating engine EEC S faults. We derived a time limit of 20 hours \\nfrom the unsafe condition criteria established for a degraded EECS. This 20 hour limit ensures that the engine maintains an acceptable reliability level during this type of operation. \\nc. EEC S SSA: General . The EECS SSA includes a quantitative element that is intended \\nto evaluate the predicted reliability of the components of the EECS, and to compare it to the system safety criteria included in this AC. The EECS SSA also includes a qualitative element that provides an evaluation of certain aspects of the EEC S. \\n(1) The EECS SSA quantitative analysis will determine the instantaneous failure event \\nrates in both the full-up system and degraded system. These event rates are then compared to the unsafe condition criteria for both full-up and degraded systems. The quantitative analysis may consist of the following analyses: \\n(a) Numerical FTA, \\n(b) FMEA, an d \\n(c) Markov or similar type of analysis to evaluate the EEC system in a degraded \\ncondition. \\n(2) The EECS SSA qualitative analysis consists of design appraisals of certain aspects \\nof the EECS. The qualitative analyses may include the following reports: \\n(a) Alternate control mode(s) characteristics, \\n(b) Control mode transition (refer to Chapter 5 of this AC), \\n(c) EEC S output data content, \\n(d) Existing subsystems, \\n(e) Local events test or analysis (refer to Chapter 6 of this AC), and \\n(f) Commercial, automotive, or industrial grade electronic parts analysis (refer to \\nChapter 6 of this AC). \\nd. EEC S SSA assumptions . The applicant should include in the EEC S SSA, an \\nexplanation of any assumptions it made regarding airplane installation and operating conditions. \\nThe applicant’s assumptions should be consistent with it’s data in the ICAs and the engine \\ninstallation or operating instructions. The applicant’s assumptions may include the following: \\nA3-2\\n \\n      \\n  \\n     \\n \\n    \\n      \\n      \\n     \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n         \\n    \\n 5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\n(1) Maintenance actions and associated intervals, \\n(2) Airplane systems or equipment response, \\n(3) Powerplant installation design and environment, and \\n(4) Latent failure exposure period. \\ne. EEC S SSA quantitative analysis . The quantitative analysis is intended to supplement, \\nbut not replace, qualitative methods based on engineering and operational judgment and experience. In general, the depth and scope of an acceptable safety analysis depend on the complexity and criticality of the functions performed by the system, and can vary considerably \\nfor different types of systems. Because this analysis is limited to reciprocating engine electronic \\ncontrol systems, the criteria provided in this appendix are more specific. The quantitative analysis should encompass all elements of the control system : electrical or electronic, and \\nmechanical. \\n(1) EEC S SSA safety criteria . This appendix provides safety criteria, expressed in \\nterms of events per million hours, for full-up and degraded configurations. The applicant may propose different criter ia. However, if the applicant do es so, the applicant should show that it’s \\ndifferent criteria provide an equally effective method of meeting the safety criteria. \\n(a) The safety criteria is provided for each of the two typical reciprocating engine \\ncontrol subsystems (fuel and ignition), and also for any other subsystem. This accommodates varying degrees of system functionality by increasing the allowable failure event rates as \\nsubsystems or functions are added to the total system definition. Once the total number of \\nsubsystems is defined and the associated maximum failure event rates are calculated, the applicant’s failure rates should be allocated across the total system and not to the individual \\nsubsystems. The failure event rates of tables A3-1 and A3-2 are consistent with FAA safety objectives for reciprocating engines. \\n(2) Full-up system analysis methods . The applicant may use this analysis to confirm \\nthat the full-up system meets the system safety criteria specified in table A3-1. We recommend \\nthat the applicant performs a numerical FTA and an FMEA, and that the applicant includes all \\nengine parts in each. \\n(a) Each of the system elements in table A3-1 is additive. “ Other” applies to each \\nsubsystem. For example, an EECS comprised of fuel, ignition, and wastegate control functions should meet a total system reliability of 15+15+15= 45 LOPC events per million hours (and 450 MPL events per million hours). This criteria is then applied to the entire system and not allocated to each of the subsystems. \\n(b) The applicant should limit the maximums to 45 LOPC and 450 MPL events per \\nmillion hours, regardless of the number of subsystems. For example, if the EECS includes more \\nthan three subsystems, the sum of the LOPC rates for the total system should not exceed 45 \\nA3-3\\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n       \\n   \\n       \\n  \\n        \\n   \\n    \\n \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n       \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n       \\n \\n    5/23/14 AC 33.28-3\\n \\nLOPC or 450 MPL events per million hours for all of the electrical and electronic elements. \\nFinally, the applicant should apply the event rates in table A3-1 to the highest appropriate system \\nor subsystem level and not to individual components of the same system. \\n(3) Degraded system analysis methods and criteria . The applicant may use this \\nanalysis to confirm that the degraded system meets the system safety criteria of table A3-2 with \\nexisting fault(s), or with time limited operations. If the existing fault(s) does not affect engine \\noperability and the criteria of table A3-2 are met, then Time-Limited Operations (TLO) may be \\napproved for these fault conditions. The analysis determines the instantaneous failure rate with one or more failures in the system. A Markov analysis, or channel failure analysis for simple systems, may be used. \\nf. Time-limited operations (TLO) implementation requirements . The EEC SSA \\nshould include the following: \\n(1) The applicant should group all EEC S faults into one of the following three \\noperating limitations categories: \\n(a) No take-off (NTO). Faults in this category preclude departure. These faults are \\ntotal system faults that result in calculated event rates that exceed the degraded system limits, or when the total system has insufficient resources to properly operate the engine. These system \\nfaults are defined as NTO faults. \\n(b) TLO . TLO faults permit operations up to 20 hours, and preclude them \\nthereafter. These faults are also system faults that result in calculated event rates that exceed the full-up system limits but which are less than the degraded system limits. Also, the system LOPC \\nand MPL rates are not generally greater than 450 and 4500 events per million flight hours, \\nrespectively. These system faults are defined as TLO faults. \\n(c) Unlimited operation (ULO). ULO faults are system faults where the calculated \\nevent rates are less than the full-up system limits (this may also apply to degraded system with certain minor faults). \\n(2) The applicant should ensure that its EEC S design provides separate cockpit \\nindications for TLO faults and NTO faults, such as: \\n(a) Indicator lights, codes, etc., and \\n(b) Confirmation of indicator function during the pre-flight check. \\nA3-4\\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n       \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n AC 33.28-3 5/23/14\\n \\n(3) The applicant should also specify engine airworthiness and operating limitations \\nfor TLO faults, NTO faults, and ULO faults, in the TCDS and STC limitations sections, the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness Limitations Section, and the Engine installation and/or operating instructions. The applicant should also include maintenance actions information associated with EECS faults in the troubleshooting procedures of the engine maintenance manual. \\n(4) The installer should publish limitations in the Airplane Flight Manual or Pilot \\nOperating Handbook. \\nTABLE A3-1.

EEC S SSA qualitative analysis . Your Qualitative analysis should include the \\nmechanical, electrical, and electronic components. It should also include the following sections: \\n(1) Alternate control mode analysis . Refer to Chapter 5 of this AC for guidance on \\nalternate mode analysis. \\n(3) EEC S output data analysis . The applicant’s reciprocating engine EEC S SSA \\nshould include information about faults or failures that could cause the transmission of faulty or drifting engine parameters to aircraft systems. It should also include a prediction of the rates of occurrence of those faults or failures. The following engine output parameters are examples of parameters that this analysis could address: \\n(a) Oil pressure, \\n(b) Engine speed, \\n(c) Manifold pressure, \\n(d) Cylinder head temperature, \\n(e) Turbine inlet temperature, \\n(f) Exhaust gas temperature, \\n(g) Calculated engine power parameters (horsepower or torque, etc.), \\n(h) Combustion pressure, and \\n(i) Engine detonation (sometimes called knock). \\n(4) Existing subsystems analysis .

Purpose. \\na. This advisory circular (AC) provides guidance for developing substantiation data to \\nsupport the design approval of critical and complex turbine engine and auxiliary power unit \\n(APU) parts produced under parts manufacturer approval (PMA).  This guidance is for the comparative test and analysis method used to show compliance to the airworthiness requirements under test and computation, per § 21.303 of Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (14 CFR). This method supports showing the engine or APU still complies with 14 CFR part 33 and Technical Standard Order (TSO) C77. \\nb. Additionally, this AC provides information on developing a continued operational \\nsafety (COS) plan and part numbering for turbine engine parts.   \\n2. Applicability. \\na. This AC provides guidance to applicants requesting PMA for critical and complex \\nturbine engine or APU parts. For the purpose of this AC, the term “engine” represents a turbine \\nengine and an APU, and the term “part” represents a turbine engine part and an APU part.   \\nb. This guidance is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation. It describes acceptable means, but not the only means, for demonstrating compliance with the applicable regulations. The FAA will consider other methods of demonstrating compliance that an applicant may elect to present.  Terms such as “should,” “shall,” “may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular method of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used.  While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in determining compliance with the applicable regulations.  On the other hand, if we become aware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in compliance with the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and we may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance. \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09\\n \\nc.

PMA applicants can show compliance to the airworthiness requirements of the product, \\ni.e., engine certification basis, on which their proposed PMA part is to be installed under test and \\ncomputation through comparative or general test and analysis, or a combination of both. Applicants requesting PMA for engine parts typically propose comparative test and analysis as the basis for their design approval. \\nb. When applicants elect to use this comparative test and analysis method to comply with \\npart 33 or TSO C77, the applicant should demonstrate that the functional design of their proposed PMA part is at least equal to that of the original type design part. Applicants frequently use reverse engineering of the type design part to support this approval basis. Although reverse engineering may be adequate to duplicate and substantiate the functional design of a simple engine part, complex or critical engine part de signs generally need more rigorous analyses and \\ntests to show equivalency between the type design and the proposed PMA part design. Thus, the test and substantiation plan applicants submit as part of their data package to show compliance \\n2 \\n\\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09\\n \\nshould reflect the criticality or complexity of their proposed PMA part design to ensure the part \\nmeets the airworthiness requirements of part 33 or the standards of TSO C77 . \\nc. The FAA is providing the following guidance to assist applicants in developing the \\nsubstantiation for the design approval of their co mplex or critical PMA engine parts when using \\nthe comparative test and analysis method.   \\n5. Part Criticality. The data supplied by applicants to substantiate that the part meets the \\nrequirements of part 33 or TSO C77 varies depending upon the criticality or complexity of the \\npart. This AC uses part categorization as guidance to applicants for determining whether or not a part is critical or complex.   \\na. Methods for categorizing parts. This AC categorizes parts based on their most severe \\npotential failure effect using various methods for assessing malfunctions and failure modes. Appendix 1 of this AC provides a failure modes and effects assessment suitable for engines. AC 33.75-1A provides descriptions of other acceptable analytical techniques. \\nb. Part Categories . The categories that this AC addresses are consistent with the \\npreviously established categories used in certificate management oversight, as defined by Order 8120.2. These categories cover potential engine failure effects. These categories are also consistent with AC 39-8, which identifies the relative risks of parts and components that could hazard an aircraft if they fail or malfunction, a nd are based on historic service data and safety \\nassessments. The part categories are defined as follows: \\n(1) Category 1. A product, i.e. engine, or part(s) thereof, whose failure could prevent \\ncontinued safe flight and landing; resulting consequences could reduce safety margins, degrade performance, or cause loss of capability to conduct certain flight operations. A Category 1 part, for the purpose of this AC, meets the definition of a critical part defined in Order 8110.42.   \\n(a) We recommend applicants who are considering applying for a PMA of a \\nCategory 1 engine part meet with the project aircraft certification office (PACO) to discuss a test and substantiation plan. Early coordination of these projects will help the applicant identify the necessary technical considerations and airworthiness requirements for that part.  \\n(2) Category 2. An engine or part(s) thereof whose failure would not prevent \\ncontinued safe flight and landing; resulting consequences may reduce the capability of the aircraft or the ability of the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions or subsequent failures. For the purpose of this AC, a Category 2 engine part is typically a complex part that may affect a critical part. \\n(a) Together with industry, we developed sample templates as aids to identify \\ntechnical elements and regulatory requirements ge nerally considered when developing test and \\nsubstantiation plans. These templates are not all inclusive; rather, they are for a limited number of typical Category 2 engine parts. They are included in Appendix 2 of this AC.   \\n3 \\n\\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09\\n \\n(b) For Category 2 engine parts, we recommend applicants discuss any questions \\nregarding the templates with the PACO.  If a template is not available for a proposed PMA part, \\nwe suggest applicants consider developing a new template to identify technical considerations and regulatory requirements.  We recommend applicants stay close to the template format provided to do this. We also recommend applicants review the new template with the PACO early in their project to determine if any additional data will be needed. \\n(3) Category 3. An engine or part(s) th ereof whose failure would have no effect on \\ncontinued safe flight and landing of the aircraft.  The only consequence would be partial or complete loss of engine thrust or power (and associated engine services).  For single engine applications, consider changing part categorization to category 1 or 2 if complete loss of thrust \\ncould prevent continued safe flight and landing or reduce the ability of the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions or subsequent failures. \\nc. Tables of Potential Failure Effects . The following tables provide potential failure \\neffects for categories 1 and 2. We also listed some examples of parts whose malfunction or failure could result in one or more of the listed potential failure effects.   \\n4 \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09 \\nTable 1.

Comparative Test and Analysis Method. When using this method to show compliance \\nwith part 33 or TSO C77, applicants need to s how that the functional design of their proposed \\nPMA part is at least equal to that of the type design part. This showing demonstrates that the \\noriginal findings of compliance for the engine rema in valid.  The certification basis of the engine \\nidentifies the requirements applicable to the proposed PMA part.  For critical and complex parts, the applicant should determine which of the original findings could be affected by their proposed PMA part. To do this, applicants must understand how their part functions in the engine operating environment and the associated airworthiness or TSO requirements.  Applicants then develop their substantiation data related to these requirements.   \\na. Functional design . For the purpose of this AC, functional design is a measure of how \\nwell the proposed PMA part adheres to the form, fit, and function of the type design part.   \\n(1) Form is the shape, size, dimensions, and other physical measurable parameters that \\nuniquely characterize a part. \\n(2) Fit is the ability of a part to inte rface or interconnect, physically and functionally, \\nat the common boundaries with another part or system of the engine.   \\n(3) Function is the action(s) the part is designed to perform in the engine.   \\n(4) Examples of turbine blade functional design include:   \\n• An airfoil design to extract a desired amount of energy at a prescribed speed.   \\n• A blade platform section to provide proper gas path sealing.   \\n• A root section for blade retention that interfaces with the disk. \\n• Cooling, materials, and other design features that demonstrate the blade is:   \\n• Durable (resistant to oxidation, corrosion, erosion, creep, fatigue, \\nfracture). \\n• Free of destructive vibratory response. \\n• Reliable. \\nb. Substantiation data. Examples of this data include: \\n• Data based on reverse engineering and formal tests and analyses results; \\n• Information from engineering handbooks;  \\n• Information based on operational, service, and maintenance experience;  \\n• Reliability data; and \\n• Other documented information directly applicable to the airworthiness of the \\nproposed PMA part. \\nTesting must be designed to evaluate the proposed  PMA part side-by-side with the type design \\npart to the extent required by those requirements identified above in paragraph 6.   \\n7 \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  AC 33-8 8/19/09\\n \\n7. Reverse Engineering Considerations. Extracting the functional design of a critical or \\ncomplex part through reverse engineering requires rigorous testing and analyses. This rigorous \\nevaluation (test and analysis) is necessary to determine the dimensional, material, and processing characteristics needed to develop the proposed PMA part design. This part design consists of drawings and specifications, including a list of drawings and specifications needed to define the configuration and design features of the part.  It also includes information on materials, \\ndimensions, and processes necessary to define the structural strength of the part and airworthiness limitations, if required.  \\na. Reverse engineering a critical or complex part design is far more extensive and difficult \\nthan creating a computer-aided-drawing or model of that part.  Unintended differences can occur when developing the drawings this way. Applicants should consider a rigorous design and review process to minimize these differences.  We recommend applicants use specifications such as American Society of Mechanical Engin eers ASME Y14.5M Dimensioning and Tolerancing, \\nor an equivalent specification, for data collection techniques. \\n(1) Since applicants generally don’t know the type design part tolerances before \\nstarting a project, determining the measurement method to obtain the required accuracy is a necessary first step. Accuracy is defined as the maximum amount by which the measured result differs from the true value.  A general rule of thumb is that measurement accuracy should be at most 10 percent of the expected tolerance.  Experience plays a major role in understanding what types of tolerances are used on specific products and features.  National standards provided by organizations such as the American Gear Manufacturer’s Association (AGMA) or the American Bearing Manufacturer’s Association (ABMA), or dr awings of similar parts, are useful starting \\npoints but should not be used in lieu of actual measurement.  Also, a feature’s surface finish can provide guidance for required measurement accuracy.   \\n(2) Examples of acceptable measurement accuracies are:   \\n(a) For a roller or ball bearing used in a gas turbine engine, precision measuring \\nequipment capable of measuring to an accuracy of 0.00001 inch or better.   \\n(b) For a precision ground surface used as a land for a carbon seal, optical flats to \\nget the required flatness. \\nb. When reverse engineering, we recommend taking measurements from multiple type \\ndesign samples to create the tolerance bands for the drawings and specifications of the proposed PMA part. These tolerance bands tend to be tighter than those of the type design, particularly if based on a limited sample size.  A purely statistical method for determining the sample size may result in a sample size which is extensive but not practical.  The drawing tolerances determined by reverse engineering for the proposed PMA part should not exceed the measured data (unless substantiated). Applicants should verify that their proposed PMA part can be manufactured to these tighter tolerances. If tighter tolerances cannot be achieved, then the applicant may either:   \\n(1) Analyze more type design parts to expand the reverse-engineered tolerances, \\nchange the drawing requirements, and support the manufacturing process; or  \\n8 \\n\\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09\\n \\n(2) Use a more precise manufacturing method (for example, grinding versus milling) to \\nbring the proposed manufactured part within tolerances.   \\nc. A reverse-engineered PMA part is intended to duplicate the form, fit, and function of \\nthe type design part it is planned to replace. Therefore, reverse engineering a part or an \\nassembly is not limited to copying the physical type design part.  Some aspects of the type design cannot be revealed through physical observation. For example, the outcome of certain manufacturing processes, such as heat treat  and shot peening, can only be evaluated by \\ndestructive inspection techniques. Therefore, these types of manufacturing processes must be \\ncarefully controlled to ensure the produced PMA part is at least equal to the type design part throughout manufacture.  Table 3 provides examples of manufacturing processes that may require control. For PMA parts that have controlled manufacturing processes, we recommend applicants provide their plans for validating these processes at the time of their PMA application.  We refer to these plans as source substantiation plans. \\n9 \\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09 \\nTable 3. Typical Controlled Manufacturing Processes \\n1.

The part design extracted through reverse engineering data, along with other factors \\nsuch as service experience, may form the basis on which improvements to features or \\ncharacteristics are introduced. However, intentional deviation from the type design of critical and complex parts can raise concerns regarding configuration management issues, unintended consequences of the design change, and applicability of the existing instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA). Therefore, applicants should consider introducing a change to their proposed PMA part design only after completing a detailed examination and design evaluation to determine if the change constitutes a major design change per § 21.93.  Applicants must clearly identify and justify through engineering evaluation all intentional changes to the proposed PMA part design with the ACO engineer(s) reviewing the design approval. \\n(1) Configuration management issues can occur because the TC holder can make \\nchanges to their part or assembly designs without considering alternate PMA-approved configurations. For instance, if a PMA part adds a disassembly aid feature, such as a tab, and subsequently the TC holder makes a design change to the mating part that creates an interference with the tab on the PMA part, then the PMA part would not be upwardly compatible with the TC holder’s design change. \\n(2) Unintended consequences may also occur when applicants make changes to their \\nproposed PMA part design. For example, if the PMA holder alters their turbine blade design to make the dovetail stronger, this could change the “weak link” in the system from the blade to the disk post. Consequently, a disk post failure of the PMA part could result in the release of at least two blades and a disk post instead of a single blade, which was the type design intent. Thus, applicants must have a thorough understanding of the relationship between their proposed changes and the assembly in which their part is installed.   \\n(3) Applicants must account for any differences between their proposed PMA part and the \\ntype design part when assessing the applicability of the existing ICA, including repair processes.  When the proposed PMA part can be installed in multiple engine models, we recommend that applicants consider the most limiting operating or installation conditions, or both, such as:   \\n• Installation applications, such as single engine versus multi-engine aircraft. \\n• Engines approved for Extended Operations (ETOPS). \\n• Recommended operating limitations, such as  \\n\\x83Time Between Overhaul,  \\n\\x83Thrust and power ratings, and \\n\\x83Redlines. \\ne.

Continued Operational Safety. PMA holders must support the continued operational \\nsafety of their designs. We recommend applicants develop a COS plan to do this.  To establish an effective COS plan, applicants should have the ability to assess design, manufacturing, and maintenance issues related to the operation of the engine on which their proposed PMA part is installed. \\na. A COS plan generally includes a suitable management plan that includes continuous \\nassessment of the part’s performance in service re lative to the applicant’s design assumptions.  If \\na failure, malfunction, or defect in service is identified, the PMA holder must report it as required by § 21.3. \\nb. A COS plan also includes appropriate methods and resources to identify the cause of a \\nfailure, malfunction or in-service defect, develop corrective actions, and implement those actions in a timely manner.  Applicants should also validate that the corrective actions restore the engine to an acceptable level of safety. \\nc. Appendix 4 of this AC provides additional information on how to develop a successful \\nCOS plan. If applicants elect to submit a COS plan, they should submit their plan during the design approval phase of the PMA process. \\n9. Part Numbering. When applicants assign a part number (P/N) to their PMA part, we \\nrecommend they use a suffix or prefix of at least 2 letters. The use of a single letter prefix or \\nsuffix to the type design part number may result in confusion between the PMA and type design parts. Engine TC holder part numbering practices often employ a single letter prefix or suffix.  For example, P/Ns 123456A and 123456B, or A123456 and B123456, designate certain changes to the type design part. Since applicants generally do not have complete knowledge of the type design part number evolution, they should use care when selecting the proposed PMA part number.  \\nFrancis A.

FAILURE MODES AND EFFECTS ASSESSMENT \\n1. A failure modes and effects assessment is a qualitative process, independent of failure rates \\nand probabilities, by which each failure mode of a part in the engine system is analyzed. Some top-level functions typically considered in an engine failure modes and effects assessment are: \\n• Maintaining structural integrity, including allowed overspeed and overtemperature \\nexceedances; \\n• Providing thrust or power; \\n• Operating in inclement weather; \\n• Providing customer bleed, power extraction, or both; and \\n• Meeting fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, vibration, emission or noise limits. \\n2. Each system and subsystem of the engine is broken down into its basic functions using a \\nfunctional block diagram consistent with the Ai r Transport Association policy for identification \\nand definition of systems.   \\n3. The functional block diagram defines each system and subsystem, and all their functions, in \\nthe turbine engine. The experienced safety engineer performing the analysis determines the part-\\nto-part and part-to-system influences in both dir ections (input and output).  The process flow is \\nshown in figure A1.1 below: \\nFigure A1.1.

The part categorization process is built around the fundamental understanding of the part \\nfunction and its potential effects on physically or functionally mating parts or both.  The \\nfundamental premise in the categorization proce ss, and in the physical operation and function of \\nthe turbine engine, is system interactions. \\na. System interactions are influences a part, or a set of parts, can have on the turbine \\nengine, propulsion system, or aircraft through fo rm, fit, or function.  These influences may \\nextend beyond the component being classified, may be direct or indirect, and may develop immediately or over time. Characteristics of these influences include: \\n(1) Direct influences, which are form and fit.  These influences are based on physical \\ncontact or interface clearances between adjacent parts. \\n(2) Indirect influences, which are functional in nature. These influences are not based \\non physical contact, but may be aerodynamic, thermal, or vibratory. \\n5. The interactions where the consequence of failure is the furthest from the cause are the most \\ndifficult to identify. Many fundamental relationships in part interactions and subsequent system effects exist. Figure A1.2 below provides four examples. \\nFigure A1.2.

TEMPLATES \\n1. This appendix provides 17 templates, listed in Table A2-1 below.  The FAA selected them \\nbased on what we found applicants were typically submitting for complex turbine engine part \\nPMA approval. These templates will aid applicants in identifying the technical elements and regulatory requirements they should consider wh en developing their test and substantiation \\nplans. Applicants must ensure that any additi onal technical criteria or regulatory requirements \\nare met for their specific proposed PMA part.  Each template is subdivided into the following sections: \\na. Section 1 - Part functional capability, which is the action the part is designed to perform \\nin the engine. \\nb. Section 2 - Part shape, size, dimensions, and other physical, measurable parameters; \\ninterconnectivity with an engine integral part or system; or both. \\nc. Section 3 – Part materials and processes – properties. \\nd. Section 4 – Part materials and processes – processing. \\ne. Section 5 - Applicable analyses. \\nf. Section 6 - Applicable testing. \\ng. Section 7 - Applicable regulatory requirements. \\n2. Sections 1 through 5 are divided into the following five columns: \\na. Column 1 is the section number. \\nb. Columns 2 and 3 identify part characteristics to be evaluated to support the functional \\ndesign intent of the type design part. \\nc. Column 4 identifies typical areas applicants should evaluate for potential part and \\nsystem failure modes.   \\nd. Column 5 is used to identify a combination of actions and criteria for risk mitigation \\nand control when a corresponding failure mode is identified in column 4.   \\n3. Section 7 of the templates identifies the part  33 (Amendments 1-20 inclusive) airworthiness \\nrequirements applicable to turbine engines.  However, not all engine certification bases include the same requirements. \\n4. If a template is not available for a particular part, the applicant can create or modify another \\nas necessary.

An outline of a reverse engineering design process for complex parts is provided below with details at each step. While not all proposed PMA parts require all of these steps, the more complex parts will generally use most of them. \\n1. Research and Background Processes. \\na. Visual and dimensional inspection of sample parts (new). \\nb. Service history review (for example, service bulletins, service difficulty reports (SDRs) \\nand Airworthiness Directives (ADs)). \\nc.

CONTINUED OPERATIONAL SAFETY \\n1. Continued Operational Safety is a closed-loop technical and logistical support system that \\nensures the continued safety of a part and subsequently the product on which it is installed, \\nthroughout its lifetime.  This support system includes three fundamental elements: \\n• Prevention; \\n• Data collection and monitoring; and \\n• Response and resolution. \\n2. The closed-loop system and the relationship between the three fundamental elements are \\nshown in figure A4.1 below: \\nFigure A4.1: Fundamental Elements of Continued Operational Safety \\nPrevention \\nData Collection \\nand \\nMonitoring \\nResponse and \\nResolution Design, \\nCertification & Manufacturing \\nService Reliability, Trending, Usage & Part Failures Lessons Learned \\nFeedback Loop \\nInvestigation, \\nAnalysis, Risk Mitigation, Corrective Action \\n3. The prevention element is intended to preclude in-service problems before they have a \\nchance to occur. The prevention element includes those activities and processes that are applied \\nduring the part design, certification, and manufacturing stage to ensure the design is adequate; the certification is thorough; and the manufacturing is controlled.  PMA applicants establishing a COS plan should include procedures that address the following: \\na. Internal Audits . Internal audits are used to monitor compliance with required \\nairworthiness standards and procedures to ensure production of airworthy components.  The audit must include detailed reviews of all Airc raft Certification Systems Evaluation Program \\n(ACSEP) and Principal Inspector (PI) audit results and any reports made to satisfy § 21.3.  The auditing procedures should have a feedback reporting system to ensure that proper and timely \\n158\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n     \\n AC 33-8 \\t 8/19/09 \\nAppendix 4 \\ncorrective action is taken in response to reports resulting from the independent audits.  Another \\norganization or person with appropriate technical knowledge and experience is often used to conduct the audit. \\nb. Part Field Experience. The following sources are available to evaluate part field \\nexperience: \\n•\\t Service difficulty reports (SDRs) (located at: http://av-info.faa.gov/sdrx/ ); \\n•\\t Pertinent airworthiness directives (ADs); and \\n•\\t Available ICA (including overhaul instructions, illustrated parts catalogs, and service bulletins (SB)) should also be reviewed. \\n(1) Operators and maintenance providers may also have service experience with the \\npart, next higher assembly, or both.  Surveying these operators and maintenance providers may be useful to confirm the findings of any SDR, Alert SB, SB, or AD review.   \\nc. Design Review and Safety Analysis Process . The safety analysis process is a \\nsystematic review of a design at appropriate stages.  The process can identify any potential failure, malfunction, or defect and considers the impact on the part, the next higher assembly, interface features, airworthiness characteristics, manufacturing controls, and inspection plans.  \\nThis information can be used to establish preventative action.  The process also evaluates the effectiveness of the preventative action through follow-on reviews.  Participants in these reviews should include representatives of functions concerned with the design under review.  Records of review and subsequent actions must be maintained and should include:  \\n•\\t A review of the available ICA and service history evaluation; and \\n•\\t A safety assessment of the PMA part.   \\nd. Part Development Planning Process . For critical and complex parts, the process focuses \\non structuring the design effort into significant elements to ensure part safety and reliability.  The elements include:  \\n(1) A design and development plan; \\n(2) A review, verification, and validation process appropriate to each design and \\ndevelopment stage; \\n(3) The responsibilities and authorities for design and development; \\n(4) A means to record project communication; and  \\n(5) Recording of design and development inputs related to part requirements (inputs \\nshould include functional and performance aspect s, statutory and regulatory requirements, and \\ninformation gathered from similar designs). \\n159 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09 \\nAppendix 4 \\ne. Manufacturing Process Change Control and Substantiation . To ensure part safety and \\nreliability, applicants utilizing a COS plan should consider a system to control manufacturing \\nprocesses. Such a system requires that each process be performed by qualified personnel in accordance with approved specifications containing definitive quality standards.  Certain parts \\nmay need engineering source approval (controlle d or frozen manufacturing processes) of \\nchanges to the manufacturing process or inspection system, or both.  Substantiation for a proposed process change may include functional or destructive testing, or both.  \\n4. The data collection and monitoring element includes those activities and processes focused \\non the collection, assimilation, and interpretation of data related to in-service part performance, \\nfor example, reliability, trending and usage.  It consists of the following procedures: \\na. Closed Loop Process for all Field Inquiries . This process is used to review, evaluate, \\nand respond to inquiries or notifications of pot ential service problems from aircraft operators, \\nmaintenance service providers, or the FAA.  This process includes a list of individuals or organizations within the company with defined responsibilities for responding to all inquiries and notifications. The process is used to identify appropriate methods and resources to investigate service problems, identify the cause of any service difficulties, develop corrective actions, and implement those actions in a timely manner.  The process is also used to define how the resolution and corrective action would be transmitted to the reporting entity, other entities potentially impacted, and the FAA. \\nb. Part-Specific Performance Data Trend Analysis . The data trend analysis process is \\nbased on part-specific performance.  This process is for a PMA part that is determined during the design phase to have a potential adverse effect on the operational safety of the product if it does not perform as intended.  This process should include a means for the PMA holder to track its parts, and receive inspection and qualitative feedback from the part user after the part is removed from service for any reason, including routine maintenance.  When possible, input from the product operator regarding part performance relative to the design assumptions should be sought. \\nc. Part Delivery Statistics. This process records the quantity of parts shipped, the shipping \\ndate and customer.  The records should also contain sufficient information to accurately link each shipped part to its lot number or to a manufacturing order. \\nd. Continuing ICA Review . Continuing ICA review is a procedure to review all available \\nnew and revised TC holder’s maintenance instructions and service bulletins, as well as ADs that pertain to each TC holder’s part replaced by a PMA part. This procedure may use periodic searches of new or revised TC holder ICAs fo r referencing a TC holder part number replaced by \\na PMA part number.  This procedure should include a list of qualified individuals or organizations within the company that can determine if any new or revised ICA could potentially affect the performance of their PMA part.  The procedure should define the steps needed when it is determined the PMA part is affected by new or revised ICA.  \\n5. The COS plan response and resolution element must include those activities and processes \\nthat focus on investigating and analyzing part failures, both actual and precursor; assessing the risks associated with continued operation; identifying and implementing any actions necessary \\n160 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n AC 33-8 8/19/09 \\nAppendix 4 \\nto mitigate an unsafe condition; and implementing corrective actions necessary to restore part safety.  These activities and processes are: \\na. Reporting required under § 21.3. Applicants already have this requirement within their \\nFAA-approved fabrication inspection system.  AC 21-9A, “Manufacturers Reporting Failures, Malfunctions, or Defects,” and AC 21-1B, “Produc tion Certificates” provide further guidance for \\nreporting under § 21.3. \\nb. Customer Notification Process.  This process should include a procedure for the release \\nand control of technical information issued to ensure all necessary parties are aware of a field problem.  The notification system may include FAA review.  The notification system should include detailed technical instructions for the end user to complete the necessary corrective action. \\nc. Ability to Identify, Develop, and Implement Field Corrective Action Plans . This \\nactivity should direct the development and implementation of corrective action plans to address unsafe conditions associated with the part failure. This activity should include a process to communicate with the supply chain and customers so that issues can be tracked and corrective actions implemented.  A good reference for this process is AC 39-8, “Continued Airworthiness Assessments of Powerplant and Auxiliary Power Unit Installations of Transport Category Airplanes.” \\nd. Failure Analysis Capability . The PMA holder should be capable of providing a failure \\nanalysis of any in-service or manufacturing difficulty.  Failure analysis capability demonstrates the applicant understands the part, its interaction with mating parts, its manufacturing processes, and the product and engine. The company should have a policy that demonstrates its understanding of who should complete the failure analysis and how it is disseminated and presented to the FAA, if required. \\ne. Customer Support . The applicant should have the ability to source and manufacture \\nreplacement parts to ensure that reliability and safety issues are satisfactorily managed.   \\nf. Feedback into Preventative Systems and Procedures. The final step in resolving service \\ndifficulties pertains to the lessons learned.  We recommend applicants establish feedback to the existing engineering, quality, manufacturing, and safety systems.  The objective of feedback is to prevent recurrence of these and similar problems, and, at a minimum, resolve them before an unsafe condition occurs. Feedback can occur through means such as a lessons learned library, training activities, continuous monitoring, and refinement of company processes.  The applicant’s management, engineering, manufacturing, and quality departments should be aware of service information that requires changes regardless of the level of safety impacted.  The key is to develop, implement, and monitor solutions to resolve problems and prevent future ones from occurring.  \\n161 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  C Advisory\\nU.S. Department \\nof Transportation Circular Federal Aviation \\nAdministration \\nSubject:  Bird Ingestion Certification Date: 04/03/2023 AC No: 33.76-1B \\nStandards Initiated By:  AIR-624 \\n1 PURPOSE. \\nThis advisory circular (AC) describe s an acceptable means for demonstrating \\ncompliance with the requirements of Title 14, Code of Fe deral Regulations \\n(14 CFR) 33.76, Bird Ingestion . Section 33.76 specifies the bird ingestion test \\nrequirements that apply to turbine aircraft engines. \\n2 APPLICABILITY. \\n2.1 The guidance in this AC is for aircraft engine manufacturers, modifiers, Federal \\nAviation Administration (FAA) engine type certification engineers, and FAA designees. \\n2.2 This AC is not mandatory and does not c onstitute a regulation. This AC describes an \\nacceptable means, but not the only means, for showing compliance with § 33.76. However, if you use the means described in the AC, you must follow it in all important respects. When the method of compliance in this AC is used, terms such as “should,” \\n“may,” and “must” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability to this particular method of compliance. The FAA will consider other means of showing compliance that an applicant may elect to present. While these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry ex perience in determining compliance with \\nthe relevant regulations. If, however, the FAA becomes aware of circumstances that \\nconvince us that following this AC would not  result in compliance with the applicable \\nregulations, the agency will not be bound by the terms of this AC and may require additional substantiation as a basis for finding compliance. \\n2.3 The contents of this AC do not have the fo rce and effect of law and are not meant to \\nbind the public in any way, and this AC is intended only to provide information to the \\npublic regarding existing requirements under the law or agency policies. \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n 04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B \\n3 CANCELLATION. \\nThis AC cancels AC 33.\\n76-1A, Bird Ingestion Certification Standards , issued August \\n07, 2009. \\n4 TITLE 14, CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS. The following regulations are referenced in  this AC. Unless otherwise indicated, you \\nshould use the current edition if following the method of compliance set forth in this \\nAC. \\n•Section 21.21, Issue of type certificate: normal,  utility, acrobatic, commuter, and\\ntransport category aircraft; manned free balloons; special classes of aircraft;\\naircraft engine s; propellers .\\n•Section 23.2400, Powerplant installation.\\n•Section 27.901, Installation.\\n•Section 29.901, Installation.\\n•Section 33.4, Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.\\n•Section 33.5, Instruction manual for installing and operating the engine.\\n•Section 33.76, Bird ingestion.\\n•Section 33.94, Blade containment and rotor unbalance tests.\\n5 DEFINITI\\nONS. \\n•Bird Ingestion.

This revision adds guidance that manufacturers may use \\nfor conducting the climb flocking bird test or approach flocking bird test. \\n7 FACTORS IMPACTING ENGINE DEMONSTRATION COMPLIANCE. \\n7.1 Front of the Engine. \\nThe front of the engine contai ns critical engine components th at will be affected by any \\nbird ingestion event. The applicant should defi ne the critical parameters for each test, to \\ninclude bird size, bird velocity, target lo cation, and rotor speed. For example, a spinner \\nassessment should rate the abilit y of its critical parameters to withstand bird impact. \\n7.2 Artificial Birds. Applicants may use artificial birds or devices for the bird ingestion test if the test bird \\nor device simulates the mass, shape, density,  and effects of bird impact to the engine \\ncore. The specific design of an artificial bi rd must be accepted by the FAA prior to use \\nin certification testing (§ 33.76(a)(5)). \\n7.3 Critical Impact Parameter (CIP). \\n7.3.1 CIP Functions. \\nBird mass, bird velocity, fan or rotor speed, bird impact or aiming location, and fan or \\nrotor blade geometry are used to characterize the maximum impact damage to the engine at bird ingestion conditions of § 33.76. For most modern turbofan engines, the \\nCIP is the fan blade leading edge stress. However, for any given engine model, the CIP \\nmay be other design features or paramete rs. For turboprop, turboshaft, and turbojet \\nengines, the CIP will most likely be a core feature such as a compressor airfoil. The FAA recommends that applicants identify th e most limiting critical ingestion parameter \\nbefore any demonstration, regardless of engine design. The FAA will evaluate any unplanned variations in controlling test pa rameters for their effect on the CIP and \\n§ 33.76 requirements.\\n3 \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n  04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B\\n7.3.2 Ex\\namples of CIP Identification. \\n•For turbofan first stage fan blades, the CIP may shift from the fan blade leading\\nedge stress to blade \\nroot stress depending on bird velocity or bird mass as these can\\naffect the slice mass.\\n•For fan blades with part span shrouds, the CIP may be blade deflection that\\nproduces shroud shingling, thrust loss, or a blade fracture.\\n•For unshrouded wide chord fan blades, the CIP may be a twist of the blade in the\\ndovetail that allows it to impact and damage the trailing blade.\\n7.3.3 CIP Tolerance. \\nFor certification tests, the C\\nIP variation from the planned test values should not be \\nsignificant. Historically, CIP variation ha s not been greater than 10 percent due to \\nde\\nviations in controlling test parameters. \\n7.3.4 Climb F\\nlocking Bird Test and Approach Flocking Bird Test. \\nParagraph 11 of this AC provides guidance on cr itical parameters for the climb flocking \\nbird test and the approach flocking bird test. \\n7.4 Critical Test Parameters. \\nApplicants should determine critical test parameters using analysis or component tests. \\nApplicants should consider experience with engines of similar type design and size, \\npaying particular attention to types a nd causes of failures in those engines. \\n7.5 Engine Tests. \\n7.5.1 Engine tests should be conducted with an ope rational engine that is representative of \\nthe type design being certified. In add ition, the demonstration of compliance must \\naccount for engine operation on the hottest  day that a minimum engine can achieve \\nmaximum rated takeoff thrust  or power (§ 33.76(a)(1)). The normal functioning of any \\nautomatic protective or recovery systems not requiring pilot intervention is acceptable, \\nincluding automatic power lever movement. However, the installation manual should \\nnote that such systems are required for the engine to comply with its type certificate, if functions are necessary to meet the run-on re quirements of § 33.76(c), (d) or (e), or to \\nprevent a condition described in § 33.75(g)(2),  which is specified in § 33.76(b)(3). \\nApplicants may also conduct the test(s) with any automatic system in a functionally degraded state, if doing so does not constitute a less severe test. \\n7.5.2 Automatic protection or recove ry systems that can reduce engine thrust or shut down \\nthe engine should remain active during the en gine tests. Inadvertent activation of an \\nautomatic protection or recovery system that causes thrust loss outside the limits of § 33.76(c)(6), 33.76(d)(4), 33.76(e)(1)(ii), or 33.7 6(e)(2)(ii) will be considered a test\\nfailure.\\n4 \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B\\n7.6 \\n7.7 \\n7.8 \\n7.9 Test F acilities Calibration. \\nThe test facility should be calibrated to ensure th a t the controlling test parameters, such \\na\\ns bird spe ed and a iming locations, remain within an a c ceptable toler ance b and and \\ntake into account CIP sensitivit y  to variations in the controlling  test parameters. The \\nF\\nAA recommends setting the tole rance ba nd so that the C I P varies no more tha n \\n10 percent  from any c om bination of controlling test parameter  va ria tions. Certain test \\nf\\nacilities and installations may  affect or re duce engine sta bi lity m argin, due to airflow \\ndistortion attributed to the pr oximity o f bird gun(s) to the e n gine inle t. These e f f ects \\nshould be identified before the test. \\nNote: Po wer or thrust should be measured within an accuracy of ± 3 percent. \\nTurboprop and Turboshaft Eng ine Tests. \\nApplicants may t est a turboprop or turbo shaft engine using an alternative load device. \\nHowever, this  coul d produce different  engine resp onse characteristics compared to an \\nengine  installed in an airc raft. In this  circumstance, applicants should document \\nresponse differen ces. If the turboshaft test is perfo rmed with an inlet, applicants should \\nrecord p ertinent engine  or facility  interface d ata d uring  the test to ensure an installed \\nengine complies with § 33.76 requirements. \\nAircraft an d Engine  Interface. \\nThe installation manual should de scribe engine an d aircra ft interfaces that could be \\naffected b y bird ingestion. Dynamic inte ractions between the engine and engine \\nsystems such as automatic surge recovery, auto relight, or propeller auto feather should \\nbe discussed in the insta llation manual if  the functioning  of those systems is needed to \\ncomply with the requirements in §  33.76. \\nInlet Throat Area. \\nApplicants must ident ify the inlet throat a rea use d to determine the qua ntity and weight \\nof bir ds for  the overall test, and then r ecord the inle t throat a rea as a limita tion in the \\ninstallation manual (§ 3 3.76(a)(2 )). Applicants should carefully d etermine the inlet \\nthroat  area for the insta llation limitation value  because f uture mod els or  insta llations \\nmay r equire a larger number or size of bird s. Tables 1 and 2 of § 33.76 base the bird \\nquantities and weights on the  engine inle t throat a rea (Dt), not the inle t highlight (DS), \\nor engine front face (De) projected areas. See figur e 1 for standard inlet dimension \\ndefinition s. \\nNote: For variable geometry inle t designs , further evaluation may be necessary to \\ndetermine a n effective in let throat area. \\n5 \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n FIGURE 1.

Generic Turbofan and Nacelle Configuration \\n7.10 Repeating Tests on De rivative Engines and Major Design Changes. \\nApplicants should analyze design change s that may affect compliance with § 33.76. \\nDesign changes where analysis shows that the critical impact parameters fall within 10 \\npercent of the engine certification baseline v alues may not require retesting. The CIP is \\noften associated with impact load at the point of bird rotor blade contact. This 10 \\npercent variation on the CIP should not be an assumed tolerance on proposed changes \\nto the takeoff power or thrust ratings. \\nNote: For the climb flocking bird test, a lower fan speed is more critical than a higher \\nfan speed, unlike other tests. The reason is that lower fan speed results in less \\ncentrifuging of the bird, and thus more bird mass entering the core, at the same bird \\ningestion speed (airspeed). \\n7.11 Hot Day Corner Point Operation. \\nThe intent of § 33.76(a)(1) is to ensure the engine is structurally and operationally \\ntolerant to bird ingestion. The applicant compliance demonstrations may include an \\nactual engine test at hot day corner point conditions under § 33.76(a)(1). Other representative engine or component tests, validated analysis, representative service \\nevents, or any combination thereof, may be used that the FAA finds acceptable. Tests may be conducted at reasonable levels of power or thrust over boost (for example, \\n6 \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n 04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B\\nope\\nration at P3 limit) to minimize the use of less direct methods of showing \\ncompliance. This is especially true if propos ed engine test ambient conditions are less \\nsevere than sea level standard day conditions . The applicant should show that analysis \\ntechniques used are capable of accurately predicting bird ingestion event outcomes \\nrelative to the requirements and criteria of § 33.76. \\n7.12 Fan Frame Struts and Bifurcation Strut Fairings. \\nFan frame struts or bifurcation strut fairings  may be exposed to bird debris impact from \\ndebris exiting the upstream fan rotor. The struts and fairings may house fuel, oil, \\nhydraulic or high-pressure bleed air lines, or  engine control system associated wiring. \\nApplicants should assess the potential for bird debris impact damage to these ducts. Sufficient design strength should exist to minimize damage to critical internal components if an impact to such structures occurs. \\n7.13 Protected Inlets. \\n7.13.1 Section 33.76(a)(6) allows an applicant to specify an installation requirement for a \\nprotected inlet, in place of certification engi ne test demonstrations. Therefore, engine-\\nlevel protection from specified bird threats would be provided at the installation level \\nby the inlet design. See § 33.5(a) for installation instruc tion requirements. \\n7.13.2 The engine manufacturer may specify detailed inlet design in the installation manual or \\nleave detailed protection methods to aircraft manufacturer discretion. \\nNote: When specifying this type of installati on requirement, the aircraft manufacturer \\nmust comply with the applicable aircraft-level requirement consistent with the engine installation instructions of § 33.5 required by §§ 23.2400(e), 25.901(b)(1)(i), \\n27.901(c)(1), and 29.901(b)(1)(i). \\n7.13.3 The threat level the aircraft manufacturer will need to address is normally associated with the certification basis for the engine. Th is means that the required size and number \\nof birds the protected inlet will have to accommodate would normally be the same as required for an engine test. However, the aircraft manufacturer could show compliance to later threat levels (14 CF R part 33 amendment), or aircra ft certification basis threat \\nlevels, as approved by the ACO Branch managing that specific aircraft certification program. If the applicant does not perform bird testing because inlet protection will be used (§ 33.76(a)(4)), the applicant must note th is on the engine type certificate data \\nsheet (TCDS) and installation manual (§ 33.76(a)(6)). \\n8 LARGE SINGLE BIRD INGESTION TEST. \\n8.1 Test and Measurement Methods. \\nComplete loss of engine power or thrust after bird ingestion for the large single bird \\ningestion engine test specifie d in § 33.76(b) is acceptable. \\n7 \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B\\n8.2 \\n8.3 \\n8.4 \\n8.5 \\n9 \\n9.1 \\n9.2 Target Selection. \\nThe a pplicant ma y determine  the most critical target location on the f irst stage r otating \\nblades from analysis, component tests, or  both. The test plan  and report should  inclu de \\nevidence of t he bi rd strike eff ect on rotating components, compr essor casing st rength, \\nmultiple  blade failure  possibilities, engine  structure str ength (fan f rame struts and  \\nfairings), and main shafts relative to the unba lance and ex cessive torque likely to occur, \\nas needed. \\nCompliance Using the § 33.94(a) Blade-Out Test. \\nThe applicant may us e the blade containment and rotor unbalance compliance (engine) \\ntest requirements, specified in § 33.94(a), in pla ce of the single large bird ingestion test, \\nif the § 33.94(a) blade-out test constitutes a more severe demonstration than a single \\nlarge bird ingestion test  with respect to rotor blade containment and roto r unbalance. \\nThe comparison to the § 33.94(a) blade-out test should consider the engi ne dynamic \\nresponse to a single large  bird ingestion ev ent. Examples of dynamic responses include \\nthe eff ects of engine  unbalance loads, engine torque loads, surge related loads, and \\naxial loads r esulting  from bird  impa ct that  transmit to  the e ngine str ucture. \\nIngestion Speed. \\nIn accordance with § 33.76(b), an inge stion  speed of 200-knots true for the large bird  \\nrequirement was selected as the optimu m speed to accommodate the various C IP \\nassociated with current turbofan engine  designs. An ingestion speed higher than 200-\\nknots ma y be mor e critic al when consider ing th e overall criteria of § 33.76(b) for a \\nspecific engine desi gn. If an applicant show s that  a different bird ingestion speed is \\nmore conservative, or more completely ev aluates the proposed design, the applicant \\nmay conduct tests and an alyses at that inge stion speed under  an equivalent level of \\nsafety (§ 21.21(b)(1)). All components considered to be part of the front of the en gine \\nmust be evaluated unde r § 33.76(a)(3) and (b)(3). \\nRun-On S equence Requirements. \\nNone. \\nSMALL AND MEDIUM F LOCKING B IRD INGESTION TEST. \\nRig T est and  Measu rement Me thod. \\nThe F AA will accept the use of r ig tests to determine if a par ticular bir d size will pass \\nthrough the inlet and into the rotor blades to demonstrate compliance to § 33.76(c). \\nPower or Thrust Measurement Method. \\nThe power or thrust measurement method should be accurate, and remain accurate, \\nthroughout the test. The applicant should be able to set the power or thrust without \\nundue delay and maintain that setting within ± 3 percent of the specified levels. The \\npower or thrust may be varied, as  a protective measure, after the first 2  minutes of \\n8 \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B\\n9.3 operation post bird ingestion, if there is sustained high en gine vibration. Use of \\nalternate load devices, such as water brakes, ma y not cont rol power withi n the ± 3 \\npercent t olerance. Therefore, the FAA recommends that an applicant obt ain approval \\nbefore beginning  the test, if use of  an alternate load device is intended. \\nT\\narget Selection. \\nThe a pplicant must select the c ritical ta rget loc ation for  the sma ll and medium bird \\ningestion tests (§ 33.76(c)(1)). When deter mining the most critical exposed location, \\nthe applicant should: \\n•Consider the expected aircraft flight path angle during the takeoff phase of flight.\\nAn area of the fan “front of engine” that is behind the lip of the inlet when the\\nengine is level to the ground may not be protected when the aircraft is in-flight.\\n•Target the first, largest bird at the core primary flow path.\\n•Target the second bird (if two or more ar e required) at the most critical exposed\\nlocation.\\n•Target any remaining birds over the fan face area so that any additional criticallocations are tested, including the centerbody, if applicable. This will achieve aneven distribution of birds over the front face of the engine.\\nAny criti\\ncal locations not targeted may be ev aluated separately by analysis, component \\ntesting, or both. All components considered to be part of the front of the engine, not just \\nthe blades, must be evaluate d under § 33.76(a)(3) and (c)(6). \\n9.4 Target Timing. \\nSection 33.76 requires all birds be fired at the fan with approximately 1 second of \\nelapsed time from the moment the first bird is ingested to the last. \\n9.5 Engine Operation Requirements. \\nThe engine must produce at least 75 percent of takeoff power or thrust after ingestion of \\nsmall and medium birds (see § 33.76(c)(6)(i)). A momentary, 3-second maximum, \\npower or thrust decrease after bird ingestion, for example, surge recovery, below 75 percent is acceptable. Exceeding engine limitations is permitted to occur during the first 2 minutes following bird ingestion in the 20-minute run-on test specified in § 33.76(c)(7)(ii). Engine limitation exceedance s should be recorded and shown by\\nevidence (acceptable to the FAA Administrator) that an unsafe condition will not result,as specified in § 33.76(c)(10). This evidence may be from previous test, serviceexperience, or analysis. Under such circum stances, the applicant should evaluate the\\noperating instructions, installation manual, and maintenance manual to determine theneed for guidelines on dealing with this type of over-limit condition specified in\\n§§ 33.4 and 33.5.\\n9 \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Run-on For Small/Medium Flocking Bird Rule \\n100 1 Ingestion at at 100% Test Day Power/Thrust. 1 Second I , I \\' I Maximum Time from First to Last Bird Fired \\n90 \\n80 , I No Throttle Movement During I \\n~ I First 2 Minutes I \\n3 70 \" 0 \"\\'--,...

The subassembly test \\nunder the § 33.76(d)(6)(ii) method should include all type design hardware that the \\napplicant considers significant to the outcome of the test, such as fan blades and their \\nretention or spacer components; fan inlet and outlet (exit)  guide vanes; spinners; fan \\ndisks; shafts; fan cases; frames; main bearin gs and bearing supports; including frangible \\nbearing assemblies, or devices, and other cr itical parts. The subassembly test must \\nadequately represent the mechanical aspects of the engine during LFB ingestion. The dynamic effects and related operability concerns noted in this paragraph include, but are not limited to, surge and stall, fl ameout, limit exceedance, and any other \\n10 \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\nDIRECTION r\\'\\\\. \\nOFAIRFlOIV ~ \\nlEAOINO eoce \\nOF AIRFOIL \\ni \\nSO PERCENT \\nFAN BLADE \\nHEIGHT \\n\\' TIP I \\nFAN BLADE \\nATTACHMENT 04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B \\nconsiderations rel\\native to the engine’s ability to comply with § 33.76(d)(4) and (d)(5) \\nrequirements. \\nNote: To use the subassembly test option, the a pplicant should show that the immediate \\ndynamic effects of the bird ingestion will not result in one of the above conditions. \\n10.2 Target Selection. \\nThe target point selection on the first exposed  rotating stage or stages of the engine \\nmust not be less than 50 percent of airfoil he ight, as measured at the fan blade leading \\nedge per § 33.76(d)(3). Figure 3 shows the ta rget point location on the leading edge of a \\ntypical fan blade. Specify the chosen target location in the test plan. The term stage or \\nstages addresses designs where multiple stag es are exposed, such as rear-mounted fan \\nconfigurations. Each exposed stage of these designs should be ev aluated independently. \\nFigure 3.

This physical N1 fan \\nrotor speed value corresponds to 90 percent of maximum rated takeoff power or thrust, \\nproduced when the engine is operated on an International Standard  Atmosphere (ISA) \\nstandard day at sea level. \\n10.3.2 After ingesting a LFB, the engine must operate for a minimum of 20 minutes, per the required run-on schedule in § 33.76(d)(5). A momentary, 3-second maximum, power or \\nthrust decrease below the required value during the first minute after bird ingestion is acceptable. A power or thrust loss greater than 3 seconds is considered a sustained \\npower loss. \\n10.3.3 Engine limitation exceedances are permitted if they are recorded and shown by evidence that an unsafe condition will not result. See § 33.76(c)(10). This evidence may be from previous testing, service experience,  or analysis. Under such circumstances, the \\noperating instructions, installation, and maintena nce manuals should be evaluated to \\ndetermine the need for additional maintenance requirements for dealing with this type of over-limit condition. See §§ 33.4 and 33.5. \\n10.4 Run-On Sequence Requirements. \\nThe total engine run-on sequence test dura tion may exceed 20 minutes, due to the time \\nused for accelerations and decelerations. Wherever a percentage of maximum rated \\ntakeoff power or thrust is specified in this paragraph, the rotor speed to attain the specified power setting will vary with test day conditions. These power settings are a \\npercentage of maximum rated takeoff power or  thrust, not a percentage of the actual \\ntest day pre-ingestion power or thrust sp ecified in § 33.76(d)(2).

Run-On for Large Floc king Bird Ingestion Rule \\n11 MEDIUM FLOCKING BIRD TEST AT CLIMB CONDITION. \\n11.1 Test and Measurement Methods. \\n11.1.1 Climb Flocking Bird Test Rotor Speed Determination. \\nCalculation of the fan rotor speed associated with the climb phase of flight is dependent \\non the design and operation of the airplane. For each engine model and installation, the \\nengine manufacturer should collaborate with the airplane manufacturer to determine the engine thrust needed to climb through an altitude of 3,000 feet in ISA standard day conditions (3,000 feet MSL) at 250 knots indicated airspeed (KIAS) (261-knots true airspeed). The associated minimum mechanical fan rotor speed for this condition \\nshould be established using engine performance simulations. The minimum speed \\nshould be the speed for the lowest rated thru st engine model offered for that aircraft \\ninstallation. If multiple climb settings are available for a particular aircraft, use the lowest climb setting to determine the core-climb ingestion rotor speed targets. If the airplane manufacturer is unknown or if no coordination on climb settings took place, \\nthe engine applicant should include informa tion on the climb settings used during the \\ntest in the installation manual. \\n11.1.2 Climb Rotor Speed Considerations. \\nTypically, little to no difference exists between takeoff and climb rotor speeds for the smaller turbofan engines inst alled on business jets. For this reason, the climb conditions \\nfor the core-climb ingestion demonstration will often be close to those prescribed for \\nthe MFB test of § 33.76(c), where the largest MF B is targeted at the engine core at full \\nrated takeoff condition. For those engines, th e most significant difference between the \\n13 \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B\\n§33.76(c) medium flocking bird test and th e § 33. 76(e) climb flockin g bird test is the\\nbird speed. An applic ant ma y combine th e 250 KI AS (261-knots true airspeed) climb\\nflocking bir d test with the e xisting MF B test if the c limb fan rotor spee d is within 3\\npercent of the r otor spee d associated with rated takeoff thr ust. The  climb flocking bir d\\ntest requirements may b e\\n satisfied b y a single c ombined bir d ing estion te st using  all of\\nthe following\\n criteria:\\n•Engine operating at rated takeoff thrust.\\n•Largest MFB fired at the 261-knots true airspeed at the engine core.\\n•Remaining bird velocit ies, \\ntargeting, and run-on in accordance with the § 33.76(c)\\nMFB crit\\neria. The remaining  birds would be fired at t he velocity associ ate d with\\n§33.76(c), which represents aircraft normal flight velocity up to 1,500 feet AGL,\\nbut not less than V1 minimum.\\n•All birds to be fired within the 1-second requirement of § 33.76(c)(7)(i).\\nThe go al is to show the c\\nore ingestion demonstration is as rigorous at the current MFB \\nfan speed condition, as it would be at the (air plane) recommend ed climb fan speed \\ncondition. Use of this approach could eliminate a\\n redundant test. \\n11.1.3 Core In\\ngestion Prediction Analysis. \\nSome engine configurations may include featur es that reject all bird material from the \\ncore intake at the takeoff and climb conditions. Such engines would be exempt from the \\nrecommended climb flocking bird test, but subject to the approach flocking bird test. \\nThe applicant may run the approach flocking bi rd test if an analysis shows that no bird \\nmaterial will enter the core during the climb  flocking bird test. The applicant should \\nvalidate the analysis using data derived fro m rig testing, engine testing, and field \\nexperience. The applicant shoul d perform the core ingestion prediction analysis before \\nrunning the § 33.76(c) MFB test. If any amount of bird material (including a single \\nfeather or tissue fluorescence under ultravio let light illumination) is found in the core \\nafter the standard § 33.76(c) MFB core dem onstration test, then the applicant must \\nperform the climb flocking bird test. Figure 5 shows when an applicant may use the approach flocking bird test instead of the climb flocking bird test. \\n14 \\nIf 33.76{c) test shows core \\ningestion, then climb flocking \\nbird test must be run \\nMCL: Fan speed and thrust needed to climb through an altitude of \\n3,000feet in ISA standard day conditions at 250 KIAS(261knots true) \\nNO \\nRun \\nApproach \\nflocking \\nbird test YEs· \\nYES VALIDATED \\nANALYSIS? \\nNO NO \\nRun Climb \\nflocking \\nbird test \\nTEST \\nSHOWS CORE \\nINGESTION ? \\nYES \\n~711 OSlF 04/03/2023 AC 33.76-1B \\nF\\nigure 5.

The span-wise location depends \\non the geometric features of the front of th e engine. Determine the target location that \\nmaximizes the amount of bird material inge sted into the core for the given test \\ncondition. The optimum target location ensures the test properly challenges the core \\nduring engine demonstration. When determinin g the target location, use analysis based \\non component test, dynamic simulation verifi ed by test, and experience with similar \\ndesigns. \\n11.3 Engine Operation Requirements. \\nAfter ingestion, a power or thrust decrease below the required value of each segment, \\nor when setting power between segments, is acceptable provided the time below the \\nrequired value is no longer than 3 seconds. A power or thrust loss greater than 3 seconds duration is considered a sustained power loss. \\n11.4 Run-On Sequence Requirements. \\nAll steps in the test sequence must be completed for showing compliance with § 33.76(e)(1)(iii) or 33.76(e)(2)( iii). Requirements are specif ied in terms of maximum\\nrated takeoff power or thrust in this paragraph. The rotor speed to attain the specified\\npower setting will vary with te st day conditions. These power settings are a percentage\\nof maximum rated takeoff power  or thrust, not a percentage of the actual test day pre-\\ningestion power or thrust specified in § 33.76(d)(2).\\nFor the climb flocking bird test, the applicant must demonstrate the entire run-on \\nsequence for showing compliance with § 33.76(e)(1)(iii). The total engine run-on \\nsequence test duration may exceed 20 minutes, due to the time used for accelerations \\nand decelerations. \\nFor the approach flocking bird test, the a pplicant must demonstrate the entire run-on \\nsequence for showing compliance with § 33.76(e)(2)(iii). The total engine run-on \\nsequence test duration may exceed 7 minutes, due  to the time used for accelerations and \\ndecelerations. The applicant must not move th e throttle for 1 minute after bird ingestion \\nas required by § 33.76(e)(2)(iii)(B). The thrust or power level may go  below flight idle \\npower or thrust for any amount of time in the first minute after bird ingestion, but the \\nengine must not flame out or go sub-idle as required by 33.76(e)(2)(ii). If thrust or \\npower is below 50 percent at the end of 1 minute, the throttle must be increased until thrust or power is between 30 and 35 percen t maximum rated takeoff power or thrust. \\nThe remaining run-on for the approach flocking bird test is 6 minutes long as defined in \\n§ 33.76(e)(2)(iii).

In  this context a  \\nhazardous condition should be  interpreted as the con  ditions described in §  33.75 .  \\nc.  Damage Tolerance. This is an elemen t of  the life management process that\\nrecognizes the  potential existence of  component  imperfections. The  potential existence of \\ncomponent imperfections are  the  result of  inhere nt material structure,  material processing, \\ncomponent design, manufacturing or  usage. Damage tolerance addr esses this  situation through \\nthe incorporation of  fracture resistant desi gn, fracture-mechanics, process control, or \\nnondestructive inspection. \\nd.

A  term used to  descri be inspections in  which any necessary  \\nspecialized processing instructions have been pr ovided, and the inspector has been instructed to \\npay attention to  specif ic critical features. \\ni.  Full Field  Inspection.  A  term used to  describe the general inspection of  a  component\\nwithout special attention to  any  specific features. \\nPage 2 Par 3 \\n1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nj.  Hard-Alpha or  High Interstitial Defect (HID).  An  interstitially stabilized alpha phase  \\nregion of  substantially higher hardness than th e surrounding material. This comes from very high \\nlocal nitrogen, oxygen, or  carbon concentrations, wh ich increase the beta transus and produce \\nthe high hardness, often brittle, al pha phase; also commonly called a Type I defect, low density  \\ninclusion (LDI), or  a  hard-alpha; ofte n associated with  voids and cracks. \\nk.  Hard Time Inspection Interval.  The number  of  flight  cycles since new or  the most  \\nrecent inspection, after which a  rotor part must  be  made available and receive the inspection \\nspecified in  the  Airworthiness Limitations Section of  the  Instructions for  Continued \\nAirworthiness.  \\nl.  Inspected  Material. That portion of  the tota l volume of  a  component that is  actually  \\ninspected under the  described conditions. Inspect ed material does not  guarantee anomaly free \\nmaterial. \\nm.  Inspection Opportunity.

Low Cycle Fatigue (LCF) Initiation. The  process of progressive  and permanent  \\nlocal structural deterioration occu rring in  a  material subject to  cyclic variations, in  stress and \\nstrain, of  sufficient magnitude and number of  repetitions. The process will culminate in  \\ndetectable crack initia tion typically within 105 cycles. For the purposes of this  AC, a  detectable \\ncrack initiation is  defined as  0.030 inch es in  length by  0.015 inches in  depth. \\no.  Maintenance Exposure Interval. Distribution of  shop visits (in-flight cycles) since new  \\nor last overhaul that an  engine, module, or  component is exposed to as a  function of  normal \\nmaintenance activity.  \\np.  Mean POD.  The  50-percent confidence level POD versus an omaly size  curve. \\nq.  Module Available. An  individual module removed from the  engine. \\nr.  Module. A  combination of  assemblies, s ubassemblies, and part s contained in  one \\npackage, or  arranged to  be  installed in  one  maintenance action. \\nPar 3 Page 3 \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n       \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n \\n       \\n  \\n       \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n     \\n \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n \\n     \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1\\ns. Part Available . A part that can be in spected, as required by the Airworthiness\\nLimitations Section of the Inst ructions for Continued Airwor thiness, without any further \\ndisassembly. Depending on the inspection re quirements, some part s may require a fully \\ndisassembled “piece part” condition, while other parts may be available for inspection while still \\nin the assembled module. \\nt. Probabilistic (Relative Risk) Assessment . A fracture-mechanics based simulation\\nprocedure that uses statistical techniques to mathematically model and quantitatively combine \\nthe influence of two or more variables to esti mate a most likely outcome or range of outcomes \\nfor a product. Since not all variables may be considered or may not be capable of being \\naccurately quantified, the numerical predictions are used on a comparative basis to evaluate \\nvarious options having the same level of inputs. Results from these analyses are typically used \\nfor design optimization to meet a predefined target, or to conduct parametric studies. This type \\nof procedure is distinctly different from an absolu te risk analysis, which a ttempts to consider all \\nsignificant variables, and is used to quantify, on an absolute basis, the predicted number of future \\nevents having safety and reliability ramifications. \\nu.

Service experience with gas turbine engine s has demonstrated that material and\\nmanufacturing anomalies do occur. These anom alies can potentially de grade the structural \\nintegrity of high energy rotors. Conventional rotor life manage ment methodology (safe-life \\nmethod) is founded on the assumption of the ex istence of nominal material variations and \\nmanufacturing conditions . Consequently, the methodology does not explicitly address the \\noccurrence of such anomalies, alth ough some level of tolerance to  anomalies is implicitly built-in \\nusing design margins, factor y and field inspections, etc. \\nb. Under nominal conditions, this safe-life methodology provides a structured process\\nfor the design and life management of high ener gy rotors, which results in the assurance of \\nstructural integrity throughout the life of th e rotor. Undetectable material processing and \\nmanufacturing induced anomalies, therefore, represent a depart ure from the assumed nominal \\nconditions. In 1990, to quantify the extent of su ch occurrences the FAA requested that the \\nSociety of Automotive Engineers (SAE) r econvene the ad hoc committee on uncontained \\nevents. The statistics pertaining to uncontained rotor events ar e reported in the SAE committee \\nreport Nos. AIR 1537, AIR 4003, and SP-1270. While no advers e trends were identified, the \\ncommittee expressed concern that the projected 5- percent increase in airline passenger traffic \\neach year would lead to a no ticeable increase in the number  of aircraft accidents from \\nuncontained rotor events. Uncontained rotor even ts have the potential to cause catastrophic \\naircraft accidents. \\nc. As a result of the accident at Sioux C ity in 1989, the FAA requested the turbine\\nengine manufacturers, through th e Aerospace Industries Association (AIA), to review available \\ntechniques to determine if a damage tolera nce approach could be introduced which, if \\nappropriately implemented, could reduce th e occurrence of uncontained rotor events. \\nd. The industry working group c oncluded that the technol ogy was now available to\\nimplement additional enhancements  to the conventional rotor lif e management pr ocess, which \\nwould explicitly address anom alous conditions. Furthermore, these enhancements could be \\nstructured to enforce design and life manage ment adaptations, whic h would enhance rotor \\nintegrity under anomalou s material or manufacturing cond itions. The additional guidelines \\nregarding damage tolerance provi ded in this AC explicitly addr ess these anomalous conditions. \\nIn addition, the damage tolerance approach will also implicitly enhance damage tolerance to \\nother anomalous conditions rela ted to design, manufacture, maintenance a nd operation. \\nPar 4 Page 5 \\n David A.

FIGURE\\nS1-1 illustrates the basic elemen ts of the safe-life approach to rotor life management. Taken\\ntogether, these processes and technologies c onstitute a procedure approved by the FAA as\\nfulfilling the requirements of § 33.14 for the type certification of aircraft  engines under part 33.\\na. Analytical and empirical engi neering processes are applied to determine statistically\\nquantified LCF-based minimum rotor service lives . The minimum lives are reflective of service \\nusage profiles associated w ith specific applications. \\nb. Structured component and engine testing is conducted to confirm rotor operating\\nconditions and to enhance confidence in the predicted minimum service lives. \\nc. Controlled and fixed processes are establishe d for the manufacture of critical rotors\\nas part of the safe-life process. These manufact uring processes are formalized in addition to the \\nproduct definition data. Periodic quality validation tes ting is used to assure product quality \\nconsistent with intended design. \\nd. Certification of declared lives is establis hed as a fraction of the minimum LCF life,\\nwith the fractional ratio dependent upon the a pproved safety factors associated with the \\nparticular application. The declared lives and supporting engineering data are submitted to the \\nFAA for review and approval as part of th e overall type certifica tion process. Upon FAA \\napproval, the certificated critical rotor life limits are documented in the Airworthiness Limitations \\nSection of the Instructions for Continued Airw orthiness, and becomes an operational limit. \\nAfter introduction into operational service, the FAA may approve increases to the critical rotor \\ncertificated life limits if the engine manufact urer can validate the proposed increases with \\nsufficient supporting da ta. The FAA may also order decreases to the certificated life under part \\n39 when warranted. \\ne. Critical rotors are retired through scheduled  operator maintenan ce action, before or\\nupon reaching the certificated life limit. \\nS1-1 \\n     \\n    \\n     \\n     1/8/01 AC 33.14-1\\nf. Opportunity inspections, as part of the normal maintenance practices, are another\\nelement of the conventional life management process. Even though the approval of certificated \\nlife limits is not continge nt upon interim or even periodic inspections, most of the critical rotors \\ndo become available for inspection several times as part of normal engine maintenance practices. \\nS1-2 \\n1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nFIGURE S1-1: Typical Example \\nConventional Life Management Process \\n \\n Methods and \\nMaterials Data Life \\nEstimation \\n Development and \\nValidation Tests Service Life and \\nProduct Assurance \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\nS1-3 \\n\\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1\\ng. The requirements for life es timation are represented by the elements in FIGURE S1\\xad\\n1. Life limits are to be specified for any e ngine rotor component where a failure of that \\ncomponent would result in a hazard to the aircraft. Within the cyclic life span, it is assumed that \\ncontinued safe operation of the specific rotor design, up to the stated life limit, is not contingent \\nupon interim or periodic inspections. The key elements of life estimation include: \\n(1)Flight Cycle Definition: A flight cycle should be defined that considers the\\nmost severe and typical opera tion of the engine. The flight  cycle provides the operational \\ndefinition so that the stress and thermal analyses can capture the transient and cyclical loading. \\nThe part lives are quoted in terms of this fl ight cycle. The flight cycle should include the \\nvarious flight segment such as start, idle, take off, climb, cruise, appro ach, landing, reverse and \\nshutdown. The hold times at the various flight  segments should correspond to the limiting \\ninstallation variables (aircraft weight, climb rates, etc.). The corresponding rotor speeds, \\ninternal pressures, and temperatures during each flight segment should be adjusted to acc ount \\nfor production tolerances and installation trim pr ocedures, as well as engine deterioration that \\ncan be expected between heavy maintenance intervals. The range of ambient temperature and \\ntakeoff altitude conditions enco untered during the engines’ service life should also be \\nconsidered. \\n(2)Thermal Analysis: The flight cycle along with the corresponding\\nperformance data, act as boundary conditions fo r the thermal analysis. Temperature levels and \\nthermal gradients should be dete rmined throughout the flight cycle and shou ld be calibrated and \\nverified by engine rotor temperature data. \\n(3)Stress Analysis: Analytical and empiri cal engineering processes are applied\\nto determine the stress distribution for each struct ural part. The analyses evaluate the effects of \\nengine speed, pressure, metal temperature and ther mal gradients at many discrete flight cycle \\nconditions. From this, the component’s cyclic  stress history is constructed. Stress \\nconcentration effects due to ge ometric discontinuities such as dovetails, bo ltholes and contour \\nchanges should be included. \\nS1-4 \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n(4) Life Prediction System: The life predicti on system is based upon test data \\nobtained from cyclic testing of specimens and components fabricat ed from representative \\nproduction grade ma terial to account for the manufacturing processes that affect LCF capability. \\nSufficient testing should be performed to evaluate  the effects of elevated temperatures and hold \\ntimes, as well as, interaction with other materi al failure mechanisms su ch as high cycle fatigue \\n(HCF) and creep. Test data should be reduced statistically in order to express the results in \\nterms of minimum LCF capability (1/1000 or alternately -3 sigma) and th e safe-life should be \\nquoted to initiation of a fatigue crack. Appropriate prior service experience gained through a \\nsuccessful program of parts retirement or precau tionary sampling inspections, or both, may be \\nincluded to expand the database. \\nS1-5 \\n\\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n \\n       \\n  \\n    \\n \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n        \\n       \\n \\n   \\n   \\n     1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nSECTION 2 \\nENHANCED LIFE MANAGEMENT PROCESS \\n1. History has shown that the safe-life philosoph y has served the turbine engine industry and \\nflying public well, and provides a solid base for further enhancement. Modifications to the \\nconventional life management pr ocedures should augment, not supplant, current approaches, \\nwhich are based on the safe-life philosophy. \\na. By adding a new element, damage tolera nce, to the existi ng conventional life \\nmanagement process, the enha nced life management process has been defined to further \\nminimize the occurrence of uncontained rotor fa ilures and thus improve flight safety (see \\nFIGURE S2-1). \\nb. Use of the enhanced life management pro cess depicted in FIGURE S2-1, will result \\nin damage tolerance assessments being conducted on critical titanium all oy rotor designs. These \\nwill be fracture-mechanic s based probabilistic risk assessment s, the results of which will be \\ncompared to the agreed upon design target risk  (DTR) values. Designs that satisfy these DTR \\nvalues will be considered to comply with the requirements of § 33.14. The engine manufacturer \\nwill have a variety of options available to achie ve the DTR values. They include, but are not \\nlimited to, component redesign, material changes,  material process impr ovements, manufacturing \\ninspection improvements, in-service inspections, and life limit reductions. \\nc. A general methodology for conducting the fracture-mechanics based probabilistic \\nanalyses mentioned above is presented in Section 3 (Damage Tolerance Implementation). \\nS2-1 \\n\\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nFIGURE S2-1: Enhanced Life Management Process \\nS2-2 \\n\\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n       \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n      \\n \\n    \\n   1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nSECTION 3 \\nDAMAGE TOLERANCE IMPLEMENTATION \\n1. Approach \\na. Fracture-mechanics based pr obabilistic (FMBP) assessmen ts are a key feature of \\nthe enhanced life management process. The resu lts of these assessments will provide the basis \\nfor evaluating the relative damage  tolerance capabilities of candi date engine designs, and will \\nalso allow the engine manufactur er to balance the designs fo r both enhanced reliability and \\ncustomer impact. The results will be comp ared against agreed upon DTR values (see \\nparagraph 5 of this Section). \\nb. The necessity for further risk  reducing actions on the part of the engine manufacturer \\nwill be based upon whether or no t the design under consideration satisfies the desired DTR \\nvalues at both the individual comp onent level and the overall engine level. If the targets are met, \\nthen the design is considered to comply with § 33.14. The manufacturer may conduct \\nquantitative parametric st udies to determine the influence of key variables such as inspection \\nmethods, inspection frequency, hardware geomet ry, hardware processing, material selection \\nand life limit reduction. The manufacturer may then make changes to the design or field \\nmanagement of the part, or both, in order to achieve the agreed upon DTR values, as shown in \\nFIGURE S3-1. This approach provides the individua l engine manufacturer with the flexibility to \\ndevelop an optimal engine design solution consis tent with customer requirements and company \\npolicies, procedures, and available resources. An example assessment utilizing this methodology is described in paragraph 2 of this  Section, and provided in  Appendix 1 of this \\nAC. \\nc. FMBP assessments will usually be perform ed during the engine component detail \\ndesign phase. Paragraph 2 of this Section defi nes an assessment methodology applicable to \\nmaterial melt-related induc ed anomalies. It contains a standard ized list of inputs for conducting \\nFMBP assessments, and a process to refine a design to achieve th e desired DTR values. \\n2. Methodology \\na. Probabilistic risk assessments may be conduc ted using a variety of methods, such as \\nMonte Carlo simulation or numerical in tegration techniques; the methodology \\nS3-1 \\n\\n  \\n   \\n \\n     \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nand assumptions used to determine the risk  should be approved by the FAA. FIGURE S3-1 \\nconceptually depicts a melt-rela ted anomaly probabilistic assessment. When performing an \\nFMBP assessment, use of the standardized input s and default data presented in this AC will \\nachieve consistent FMBP assessment results across the industry. \\nb. A list of standardized inputs  is provided below. Default input data is described in \\nparagraphs 3 and 4 of this Secti on. Use of this default data in probabilistic assessments requires \\nno further demonstration of applicability or accuracy. However, where this data is used, the \\nguidelines accompanying this data should be followed by the engine ma nufacturer to ensure \\napplicability. Use of input  other than these default values may require additional validation to \\nverify applicability, ad equacy, and accuracy. \\nc. Probabilistic risk assessments should incorporate the following inputs as part of a \\nbasic analysis: component stress and volume, material properties,  crack growth lives, anomaly \\ndistribution, design service life, inspection PODs, and maintenance exposure rate. \\n(1) Input. The following criteria are defined as basic input data. \\n(a) Anomaly Distribution . For melt-related (hard-alpha) assessments, \\nuse the default anomaly distributi ons outlined in paragraph 3 of this Section, or FAA approved \\ncompany-specific data. Company- specific data should be deve loped using the same process \\nemployed to derive the default anomaly distributi ons. This process is described in a technical \\npaper titled “Development of Anomaly Distributions for Aircra ft Engine Titanium Disk Alloys” \\n(see Section 5). Anomalies will be treated as sharp propagating cracks from the first stress \\ncycle. \\n(b) POD. Default PODs and instructions on use of individual company \\nvalues are contained in paragraph 4 of this Section. Subsurface assessments should consider \\nthe effects of ultrasonic inspection only. Surf ace assessments should likewise consider the \\neffects of fluorescent penetrant inspection (FPI) and eddy-current inspection (ECI). \\n(c) Maintenance Exposure Interval. For the purpose of assessing \\ninspection benefits, exposure inte rval curves for the engine, mo dule, or component in question \\nshould be modeled in the analysis. \\n(d) Stress. Variable influencing crac k propagation life. Input should \\nencompass the most limiting operationa l principal stresses. Subsurface \\nS3-2 \\n\\n \\n   \\n        \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n      \\n      \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n        \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n    1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nassessments should incorporate the appropriate subsurface and near surface stress distribution. \\nSurface assessments should incorporate the appropr iate surface stress distributions, including \\nthe effects of stress concentration. Flight cycle(s)  for design LCF certifica tion, or actual usage \\n(if known) should be used to establish the stress profile. The influence of major and minor \\ncycles needs to be considered  since the cyclic damage accu mulation can be dramatically \\ndifferent for crack propagation as opposed to ini tiation. Note that the me thod described in this \\nAC has been calibrated against industry experience without cons ideration for the effect of \\nsurface enhancements such as shot peening on the predicted crack propagation lives. As a \\nresult, it is inappropriate to include the beneficial effects of such enhancements on any \\ncalculations at this time. This issue may be a ddressed in future revisions of this document. \\n(e) Volume. Affects the probability of having a defect in the material. \\nRepresents the volume of material at a specific level of stress. For subsurface assessments, \\nrepresents the volume of material  at various levels of subsurfa ce stress. Surface assessments \\nshould incorporate volume co nstituting a thin layer (\"onion skin \") around the surface of the part. \\nWhere a non-axisymmetric feature, such as a series of holes in a disk web has a localized stress \\nconcentration, the decision on whether it makes a significant c ontribution to the probability of \\nburst must be based on the combination of mass of  material at high st ress and the size of the \\nanomaly which would cause the part not to reach  its safe declared life. While the method \\ndescribed in this AC assumes axisymmetric features, a non-axisymmetric feature can be \\nincluded by reducing the cross-sec tional area to ensure that the total volume when integrated \\naround the whole circumference is e qual to the volume at high stress. \\n(f) Materials Data. Average cyclic crack  growth rate properties of the \\nbase material generated in an air environmen t, should be used as the default condition to \\ncalculate anomaly propagation life. \\n(g) Propagation Life. Number  of cycles for a given size anomaly to \\ngrow to a critical size. Base d upon knowledge of part stress, temperature, geometry, stress \\ngradient, anomaly orientation, and materials properties. Linear elastic fracture-mechanics \\nshould be used for the calcula tion of propagation life. Default conditions should assume \\nanomalies to be in the worst orientation to the stress field. \\n(2) Calibration \\n(a) Each engine manufacturer should ca librate its analytical prediction \\ntools by conducting the industry test case detailed in Appendix 1. The test \\nS3-3 \\n\\n    \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n \\n       1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\ncase consists of a probabilistic an alysis of a simulated titanium ring disk, using specified inputs \\nand scenarios. Test case results in the ranges from 1.27E-09 to 1.93E-09 (for the “no \\ninspection” case) and from 8.36E-10 to 1.53E-09 (fo r the “with in-service inspection” case) are \\nconsidered acceptable. Test case results outside of these ranges may indicate problems with \\neither the probabilistic assessment technique or  the assumptions made. \\n(3) Output \\n(a) Component Level Assess ments. The probabilistic assessments and \\nprediction of event potential shoul d be calculated over the entire anticipated service life of the \\npart. This result should be expr essed as the number of predicted events for each cycle, and be \\ndesignated as the predicted “component event ra te”. For multiple stage components such as \\nspools, the assessment should be conducted for each stage. Th e predicted component event \\nrate should then be compared to the component level DTR valu e to assess design acceptability. \\n(b) Engine Level Assessments. Once all critical titanium rotors in a \\ngiven engine configurati on have satisfied the component leve l DTR value, the cumulative event \\nrate for these components should be calculated a nd compared to the engine level DTR value for \\nacceptability. \\n(4) General Comments. At this time, sta ndardized inputs and default data for \\nFMBP assessments are available only for titanium material melt-related (hard-alpha) anomalies. \\nFuture updates to this AC may include materi al anomaly information for other rotor grade \\nmaterials such as Nickel as well as inputs a nd default data for manufacturing and maintenance \\ninduced anomalies. The corresponding default da ta for DTR values for titanium materials are \\nspecified in paragraph 5 of this Section. \\n(a) The FAA strongly encour ages engine manufacturers to incorporate \\nfracture resistant design concepts  where possible. Credit may be given for fracture resistant or \\nburst resistant engine de sign features that clearly demonstr ate, through both anal ysis and test, a \\nreduction in the potential for rotor failure due to the presence of unanticipated material melt \\ninduced anomalies. \\nS3-4 \\n\\n       \\n \\n       \\n \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n  1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n(b) Because the design of an aircraft turbine engine rotor is a lengthy \\nprocess involving numerous iterati ons, each of which can substant ially alter the initial calculated \\nDTR values, it is important that the DTR values be satisfied at the time of engine certification. \\nSome FMBP assessments may also  occur several years after the engine enters service because \\nof such influences as design changes associated  with in-service proble ms or changes in the \\nanalytical results due to evolving predictive capability. It is import ant to state here that the DTR \\nvalues should be satisfied at bot h the individual component and ov erall engine levels throughout \\nthe life of the hardware. \\nS3-5 \\n\\n  \\n  \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nPea k  Stres s  Condition \\nProbabilistic \\nAssessment \\nPart Design Life \\nFIGURE S3-1: Typical Elements of a Titani um Melt Related Anomaly Risk Assessment \\nS3-6 \\n\\n   \\n          \\n         \\n  \\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n        \\n      \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n     \\n \\n    \\n    \\n       \\n   \\n \\n  \\n     1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n3. Anomaly Distributions . A key input distribution associated with FMBP assessments is the \\nsize and rate of occurrence of the anomalies. This type of information is statistical in nature and \\ncan be presented in a form that plots number of inclusions that exceed a particular size in a \\nspecified amount of material. \\na. Titanium Melt-Related (Hard-Alpha) Distributions. \\n(1) Hard-alpha anomaly distributions that apply to fully machined components \\nhave been developed to charact erize a type of incl usion found in titani um (See Appendix 3). \\nThe distributions are applicable to titanium ro tor components manufactured after 1995; using the \\ntriple vacuum arc remelt (VAR) process or, the cold hearth me lt (CHM) plus VAR processes. \\nFor example, FIGURE A3-7 represents the a nomaly distribution for a component which was \\ninspected at both the bi llet and the sonic shap e to at least a #3 FBH (flat bottom hole). \\n(2) The anomaly distributions contained in Appendix 3 may be used to \\ndetermine compliance with paragraph 5 of this Section, DTR requirements . The background of \\nthe development of these distributions are contai ned in a technical paper titled “Development of \\nAnomaly Distributions for Aircraft Engine Titanium Disk Alloys.” Briefly stated, the distributions \\nwere developed by modeling a comp lex series of interrelated st eps that simulated the entire \\ncomponent manufacturing process from billet conversion to final machining. The final \\ndistributions were validated based on field expe rience. This process re sulted in a number of \\ndistributions that could be used to determine a relative risk reduction, but not an absolute level \\nof risk. \\n(3) Individual engine manufacturers who desire to utilize an alternate anomaly \\ndistribution or an improved inspection should us e the methodology contained in reference No. 5 \\nof Section 5 to create the alternate distributions. The alternate distribution must be substantiated \\nby the appropriate background data. An alternate distribution should include the following: (a) \\nthree dimensional incl usion data, (b) inspection POD data , (c) should account for potential \\nundetected, uncracked a nd unvoided inclusions, a nd (d) should be based upon s ubstantial field \\nexperience. \\nb. Manufacturing/Maintenance Induced Anomal y Distributions. At the present time, \\nthere are no default data distributions for us e in FMBP assessments for manufacturing or \\nmaintenance based anomalies. \\nS3-7 \\n\\n  \\n     \\n \\n   \\n         \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nc. Rotor Grade Materials Other Than Titanium Alloy. At th e present time, there are no \\ndefault data distributions for use in FMBP assess ments for rotors made of materials other than \\ntitanium alloy. \\n4. Default Input - POD by Nondest ructive Evaluation (NDE). \\na. The capability of individual NDE processes, such as eddy-current, penetrant, or \\nultrasonic inspection for the detection of local ma terial anomalies (discontinuities or potential \\nanomalies), is a function of numer ous parameters, including the size, shape, orientation, location, \\nand chemical or metallurgical character of th e anomaly. In addition, the following four \\nparameters should be consid ered when assessing the capabilities of an NDE process: \\n(1) The material being inspected (suc h as its compositi on, grain size, \\nconductivity, surface texture, etc.). \\n(2) The inspection materials or  instrumentation (such as the specific penetrant \\nand developer, the inspection frequency, in strument bandwidth and linearity, etc.). \\n(3) The inspection parameters (such as scan index). \\n(4) The inspector (such as visual acuity, attention span, training, etc.). \\nb. The “default” POD data supplied with this  AC are characteristic of inspection \\ncapability that has been measur ed under typical, well controlle d conditions. These default POD \\nvalues are provided primarily to facilitate selectio n of nondestructive insp ection techniques that \\nare best suited to support attainment of damage tolerant inspections.

Design Target Risk (DTR). \\na. The DTR is an agreed upon benchmark risk  level selected to enhance the overall \\nsafety of high energy titanium rotating compone nts. Since no machine or device is 100-percent \\nreliable, it is inappropriate to require a level that is technologically unachievable. Nevertheless, \\nthe goal is to achieve a signif icant and distinct improvemen t over and above current rotor \\ndesigns. \\nb. Representative “Component level DTRs” and an “engine level DTR” for titanium \\nhard-alpha anomalies have been  established based on improvements of the data presented in \\nthe SAE report. These DTRs represent consen sus values, developed from assessments on \\nrepresentative component designs using the met hodology and inputs (described in paragraphs \\n1-4 of Section 3). The “component level DT R” corresponds to the maximum allowable \\npredicted component event rate. The “engine  level DTR” corresponds to the maximum \\nallowable (cumulative) componen t event rate for all critical tita nium rotating parts in a given \\nengine. \\nc. Designs must satisfy the co mponent level DTR and the engine level DTR to be \\nconsidered acceptable. \\n(1) Application. Default DTR values have  been established for melt related \\n(hard-alpha) anomalies. Calculated even t rates should be assessed against the \\nS3-9 \\n\\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n      \\n     \\n   1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nappropriate DTR values. For multiple stage compon ents, such as spools, each individual stage \\nmust satisfy the component level DTR value. \\n(2) Default DTR values fo r titanium alloys: \\n(a) Melt related (hard-alpha) anomalies: \\ncomponent level DTR: 1 x 10-9 events/flight cycle \\nengine level DTR: 5 x 10-9 events/flight cycle \\n(b) Manufacturing or Maintenance Induc ed Surface Anomalies: At the \\npresent time, there are no default DTR values for manufacturing or maintenance related surface anomalies. \\n(3) Default DTR Values for Other Than T itanium Alloy: At the present time, \\nthere are no default DTR values for other than titanium alloys. \\nS3-10 \\n\\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n     1/8/01 AC 33.14-1\\nSECTION 4 \\n“SOFT TIME INSPECTION” ROTOR LIFE MANAGEMENT \\n1. Approach. The overall life management proce ss encompasses a wide spectrum of design,\\nmanufacture, and product support i ssues. This section addresses onl y one facet of that overall\\nprocess, namely the assurance of structural in tegrity using inspection te chniques and intervals\\nderived from a damage tolera nce (fracture-mechanic based)  assessment. The inspection\\nphilosophy is solely intended to protect against anomalous conditions. It is not intended to allow\\noperation beyond the safe-life li mit specified in the Airworthin ess Limitations Section of the\\nInstructions for Continued Airworthiness.\\na.In instances where probabilistic  assessment indicates risk  levels greater than the\\ndesired target, many strategies can be utilized to  reduce the predicted risk to the appropriate \\nlevel. However, only the in-service inspection option is addressed here. \\nb.The industry data on uncontai ned fracture experience su mmarized in SAE reports\\nAIR 1537 (1959 through 1975), AIR 4003 (1976 through 1983),  and SP1270 (1984 through \\n1989) was used to guide the de velopment of the inspection ph ilosophy. These reports indicate \\nthat the maintenance induced uncontained failure rates were comparable to the failure rates for \\nanomalous conditions (material a nd manufacture). This data sugg ests that additional inspection \\nrequirements, if not properly integrated into the normal maintenance scheduled for the engine, \\nwould have no net benefit to the uncontained failure rates. \\nc.The inspection philosophy presented here  evolved from the desire to have\\ninspections easily integrated into the operation of  the engine yet achieve measurable reduction in \\nthe uncontained failure rates. The inspection philosophy advocates the use of opportunity \\ninspections rather than forced  inspections at ‘not to exceed ’ intervals. These opportunity \\ninspections occur due to the ‘on condition’ ma intenance practices used by operators today. \\nAlthough the opportunity insp ections occur at random intervals, they can be  treated statistically \\nand used effectively to lower the calcu lated risk of an uncontained event. \\nd.Opportunity inspection refers to those instances when th e hardware in question is\\navailable in a form such that the specified inspection can be performed. This condition \\nS4-1 \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n       \\n   \\n \\n         \\n  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nis generally viewed as being reduced to the pi ece part; however; opportun ity inspections can be \\nperformed on assembled modules. For example, an  ECI of a disk bore may be specified on an \\nassembled module whenever the module is available. This inspection is an opportunity \\ninspection based upon module availability rather than  piece part availability. \\ne. Whenever possible, the desi gns should use opportunity insp ections to meet the DTR \\nlevels. However, in some inst ances, the probabilistic analysis may indicate unacceptable risk \\nlevel when using just opportuni ty inspections and some additional action may be required to \\nmeet the DTR. One of the many options to mitigate this risk is to force inspection opportunities \\nby specifying disassembly of modules  or engines when a cyclic lif e interval has been exceeded. \\nThere are many options on how to implement the forced disassembly. Th e options range from \\nmandatory engine removal and s ubsequent teardown at not to ex ceed cyclic limits (“hard-time” \\nlimits) to mandatory module teardown when th e naturally occurring module availability exceeds \\nthe specified cyclic life inspection interval of  one of the parts contained within that module \\n( “soft-time” limits). This AC only advocates th e use of the soft-time inspection option when \\nforced disassembly of modules is  required to meet  the DTR levels. \\nf. The soft-time inspection philo sophy retains the “on-condition” maintenance practice \\nand minimizes the impact  of additional module disassembly.  The inspection requirement comes \\ninto effect only after the engine  has been removed from the aircra ft for a reason other than the \\ninspection itself, and is in a sufficient state of disassembly to afford access to the module \\ncontaining the component in ques tion. An available module contai ning a part with cycles since \\nlast inspection (CSLI) in excess of the soft-time interval will be required to be disassembled to a condition that allows inspection by the procedur e specified by the engine manufacturer. The \\nrisk associated with parts that become available for inspection before the soft-time interval must \\nbe evaluated by the engine manufacturer to determine if the CSLI can be reset. \\ng. The maintenance impact of the soft-time in tervals should be considered during the \\ndesign phase. The probabilis tic analysis summarized in Secti on 3 should be used along with the \\nanticipated engine removal rate  and the module and piece part av ailability to develop designs \\nthat achieve the design target, but also result in acceptable soft-time intervals and procedures, \\nshould such action be required. \\nh. When invoked, the soft-time in spection approach establishe s interval limits beyond \\nwhich rotor components must be inspected when the rotors are available in modular form. The \\nsoft-time inspection requirement is not intended to impact or modify \\nS4-2 \\n\\n    \\n    \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n      \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n      \\n   1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\ncurrent practice of forced inspection programs to a ddress safety of flight concerns that arise in \\nthe course of engine operation and maturation. Th ese safety of flight concerns would continue \\nto be addressed through aggressive insp ection programs which are mandated through \\nAirworthiness Directives (ADs). \\ni. It is important to recognize that the insp ection assumptions made in the probabilistic \\nrisk assessment must be commun icated and implemented accurate ly to the field by using the \\nAirworthiness Limitations Sectio n of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness, and be \\nvalidated by the review of engine  removal rates and module and pi ece part availability data. For \\nexample, the Airworthiness Limitations Section must call out an immers ion ultrasonic inspection \\nif that was an assumption in setting the original  soft-time interval. Sim ilarly, the amount of \\ninspected material should corresp ond to the analysis assumpti ons. Likewise, if the field \\nexperience suggests that the opportunity inspectio n intervals are in excess of the assumed rates \\nin the probabilistic risk assessment, then appr opriate corrective action, such as a modified \\ninspection plan, is required. \\nj. The soft-time inspection interval and reference to the corresponding inspection \\nprocedures will be specified in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for \\nContinued Airworthiness. This in formation is to be provided for all rotor parts with specified \\nretirement life limits that require any inspection plans beyond  opportunity inspections to meet the \\nDTR levels. The required inspect ion information should also be included in the individual \\nAirworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Con tinued Airworthiness with the other \\nrotor inspection requirements. The manufacturer will also provide necessary information to \\nfocus the prescribed inspections to those areas of highest relative risk. \\n2. Inspection Scenarios. \\na. The following scenarios clarify the action that would be taken at a maintenance \\ninspection opportunity. Note that the inspection plans may vary for each part, depending on the \\noutcome of the probabilistic assessments. \\n(1) Maintenance Opportunity - Hardware Available For Opportunity \\nInspection: Hardware available in the condition to perform the specifie d opportunity inspection \\nmust be inspected by the procedures specified in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.  This would be a mandatory inspection. \\nS4-3 \\n\\n    \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n   1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n(2) Maintenance Opportunity - Module Belo w Soft Time Interva l: Hardware \\naccessible in the assembled or partially disassembled module may be nondestructively inspected \\nby the procedures specified in the Airworthines s Limitations Section of the Instructions for \\nContinued Airworthiness. The CSLI may be rese t to zero, provided the engine manufacturer has \\nassessed the risk impact associat ed with this action. This woul d be a discretionary inspection . \\n(3) Maintenance Opportunity - Module Above Soft Time Interva l: Hardware \\nlisted in Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness must be made available for nondestructive inspection, using the procedures that are specified. This \\ninspection must be performed wh enever the module is available and the CSLI for any contained \\nhardware that exceeds the inspection cycle li mit. This would be a mandatory inspection. \\nS4-4 \\n\\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n    3/7/17 AC 33.14-1, Chg 1 \\nSECTION 5 \\nREFERENCES\\n \\n1.

The anomaly distributions are pr ovided in Appendix 3. \\nFor this test case we will use the anomaly dist ribution presented in FIGURE A3-7 of Appendix \\n3 titled “Post 1995 Triple Melt Hard-Alpha Distri bution with #3 FBH billet inspection and #3 \\nFBH forging inspection”.

Test Case Analysis Guidelines \\na. Analytical guidelines for the probabilistic assessments are provided with the intent to \\nminimize the variations of the applicants results due to analytical assumptions. \\nThe practice presented is based on a typical embedded anomaly probabilistic fracture- \\nmechanics approach. The component is subdivided in to zones, the relative risk or probability of \\nfracture (POF) is calculated for each zone, and re sults for each zone summed statistically to \\narrive at the total component POF or relative risk. \\n(1) This analytical approach can be br oken down into five basic steps: \\n(a) Stress analysis. \\n(b) Zone definition and volume calculation. \\n(c) Crack growth model definition. \\n(d) Crack growth calculation. \\n(e) Zone and total part  POF calculation. \\n(f) Paragraph 4 of this Appendix provi des a systematic example for the \\ncalibration test case. \\nb. General Analytical Guidelines: \\n(1) Stress Analysis . The level of mesh refine ment of the part model is left up to \\nthe individual applicant’s discretion. However, st eps should be taken to ensure that the final \\nanswer does not change by a significant amount (5 -percent on relative risk or POF) if a finer \\nmesh is chosen. \\n(2) Zone Definition. Zones are defined as regions of the com ponent (typically \\nmade up of a number of finite elements) where li fe is approximately cons tant for a given initial \\ncrack size. Grouping elements into z ones based on stress intervals of 5 \\nA1-3 \\n\\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n      \\n    \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n         \\n     3/7/17 AC 33.14-1, Chg 1 \\n Appendix 1 \\nksi (34.5 Mpa) is a suggested practice for initial zone definition. Furthe r zone refinements may \\nbe required for analytical conve rgence. FIGURE A1-1 provides a general description of the \\ntypical types of zones. \\nFIGURE A1-1 \\n(3) Crack Growth Calculation . The crack  growth life assumed for each zone \\nshould be based on the minimum life location in the zone. Th is conservative assumption may \\nrequire that regions of the component that make a significant contribution to the total part POF \\nbe broken down into multiple zo nes. This subdivision process is carried out until convergence \\nof the risk calculation is reached. \\nNOTE: The effect of surface enhancement, such as  shot-peen, is not considered in the test \\ncase analysis. However, once the test case ha s been performed and the analysis process \\nsuccessfully calibrated, the manufacturer may consider these effects when analyzing actual \\nhardware. \\n(4) POF/Risk Calculation. The POF of the part is calculated by statistically \\ncombining the POF of each zone (surface a nd subsurface). The POF of each zone can be \\ncalculated in either of two ways: \\n(a) An integrated probabilistic method. \\n(b) A ‘’Monte - Carlo’’ method. The number of simulations required  \\nis related to the computed risk. The general rule is that the number of simulations should be at \\nleast 2 orders of magnitude higher than the computed risk, for example, if risk is 1 failure in 104 \\nparts, the number of samples required is 106. This ensures that about 100 “failed” parts are \\ninvolved in the assessment. \\nA1-4 \\n\\n \\n    \\n  \\n     \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n     \\n      \\n   \\n \\n      \\n    \\n    \\n  3/7/17 AC 33.14-1, Chg 1 \\n Appendix 1 \\nc.

To reach a \\nconverged solution, high stress near surface regions of the part may require additional refinement \\nbeyond the 5 ksi bands suggested in the genera l guidelines (e.g., disk bores and bore sides). \\nSubdivision of these regions in to subsurface \"onion skin\" la yers, like the surface volumes \\ndiscussed next, will likely capture the rapid change  in life from surface to subsurface and reduce \\nconservatism in the prediction.

This Appendix provides an example of an acce ptable process for setting the opportunity \\ninspection requirements that will be specified in Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions \\nfor Continued Airworthiness. As discussed in  Section 4, the application of the opportunity \\ninspection is one of a num ber of options available to reduce th e predicted POF in the event that a \\ncomponent design does not meet the DTR criteria. \\na. Section 4 introduced the following three scen arios for opportunity inspections to clarify \\nthe actions that could be taken at a maintenan ce opportunity. They are (1) Hardware available for \\nopportunity inspection, (2) Module below soft time interval, (3) M odule above soft time interval. \\nExamples of the first and third s cenarios will be presented in this Appendix, and the second scenario \\nwould be analyzed in a similar fashion to the third scenario. \\nb. Key elements in determining opportunity inspection requirements given any scenario are \\nthe type of inspection method and associated level of sensitivity, the maintenance interval at which \\nthe hardware will be exposed for inspection, and the cy clic threshold or soft ti me interval for module \\nexposure at which time the inspections will be i nvoked. Given a scenario, details of an inspection \\nplan can take many forms. FIGUR E A2-1 shows the decision process for selecting the appropriate \\ninspection requirements. This flowchart will be referenced throughout this section to guide the discussion. \\nA2-1 \\n\\n \\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 2 \\nFIGURE A2-1 \\nIn-service Inspection Decision Process \\nA2-2 \\n\\n    \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n       \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 2 \\n2. Example of Scenario (1), Hardware Available for Opportunity Inspection. \\na. It was shown in Appendix 1 that the predicte d POF for the simple ring disk, without the \\nbenefit of in-service inspection is 1.9 E-09 events/c ycle (Block 2 of FIGURE A2-1). Therefore, the \\nring disk design does not meet the 1.0 E-09 event/cyc le DTR (A “No” answer at Block 3). If the \\nring disk POF was le ss than the DTR, the design would be c onsidered acceptable (Block 4) and no \\nin-service inspection would be required. \\nb. Assuming a design change is not possible (for example, a reduction in stress, change in \\nmaterial, or enhance manufacturing  inspection), the decision is ma de (Block 5) to explore the \\nopportunity inspection option to reduce the component risk below the DTR. \\nc. With the decision made to pursue the insp ection route, the level of maintenance \\nopportunity is selected for study. The options available are piece pa rt, module, engine, or some \\ncombination of these opportunities. The desire is to select an exposure level or  combination of levels \\nthat minimizes the impact on the operator, yet ha s a high potential of reducing the component risk \\nlevel. It is anticipated that the applicant will use trial and error to arrive at the optimum solution. \\nHowever, working with this damage tolerance crite ria will give the applicant experience for making \\ngood initial selections reducing the amount of analytical effort in  future analyses. Fo r the initial pass, a \\none time ultrasonic inspection (UT) at first pi ece part exposure (Block 6), and an inspection \\nthreshold of zero cycles (Block 7) will be ev aluated. The piece part maintenance exposure \\ndistribution for the ring disk is shown in FIGURE A2-2 below. \\nFIGURE A2-2 \\nA2-3 \\n\\n        \\n    \\n \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n \\n   \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n        \\n    1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 2 \\nd. A UT inspection rejecting indications equal to or greater than a number 3 FBH is \\nselected. The solid line in Appe ndix 5, FIGURE A5-4 is the POD for this inspection (Block 8). \\ne. The probability of fracture calcula tions are performed (Block 9)  in the same manner as in \\nstep 6 of Appendix 1, except inst ead of a fixed inspection at 10,000 cycles, inspections are assumed \\nto occur as the piece parts are exposed. The piece part exposure distribution is treated as a random \\nvariable in the prob abilistic analysis. \\nf. The calculated probability of fracture is 1.3 E-9 events/cycle, still greater than the DTR (A \\n“No” answer at Block 10). On a second pass a mo re sensitive UT inspection is assumed, rejecting \\nindications equal to or greater than ½ the respons e from a number 3 FBH. The associated POD for \\nthis inspection is represented by the dotted line in FIGURE A5- 5. The resulting POF is 9.9 E-10 \\nevents/cycle, meeting the DTR (A “Yes” answer at Block 10). \\ng. The design would be considered acceptable (relative to damage tolerance criteria) and \\nthe following inspection requirements would be pla ced in Airworthiness Limitations Section of the \\nInstructions for Continued Airworthiness (Step 12): \\n(1) Inspect at first pi ece part exposure. \\n(2) UT inspection calibrated to a #3 FBH. \\n(3) Reject indications equal to or greate r than ½ the response from a number 3 \\nFBH calibration. \\n(4) Include reference to detailed UT inspection procedures. \\n3. Example of Scenario (3), Modul e Above Soft Time Interval \\na. For this example, exposure of the ring disk pi ece parts is expected to occur at a lower \\nrate than in the previous scenario. This change is depi cted in FIGURE A2-3 below. \\nA2-4 \\n\\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n    \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 2 \\nFIGURE A2-3: New Ring Disk Fi rst Part Exposure Distribution \\nb. The predicted POF, assuming this new exposur e distribution, and th e same UT inspection \\nand sensitivity as in scenario (1), is 1.2E-09 events/cycle. Since the predicted POF exceeds the \\nDTR, additional action is warranted. \\nc. Assuming that it is not reasonable to us e a more sensitive UT field inspection (for \\nexample, calibration to a smaller fl at bottom hole), the module exposure  distribution is evaluated (see \\nFIGURE A2-4 below). \\nA2-5 \\n\\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n     \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 2 \\nFIGURE A2-4: New Ring Disk First Exposure Distributions \\nd. The resulting predicted POF is 8.3 E-10 even ts/cycle, clearing the DTR with margin. \\nHowever, specifying UT inspection of the ring disk  at module exposure requires that the disk be \\nremoved from the module increasin g the burden on the operator. Sinc e there is margin between the \\npredicted POF and the DTR, an alternative inspection plan will be considered that will alleviate some \\nof the burden of forcing modules to piece part le vel. This approach implements the soft time \\ninspection interval scenario. Instea d of going to just the module ex posure, the inspec tions would be \\nperformed at piece part exposure for a specified cyclic interval, then change to inspections at module \\nexposure. The cyclic interval before imposing insp ection based on module expo sure is the soft time \\ninspection interval. \\nA2-6 \\n\\n \\n \\n    \\n         \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n    \\n \\n    \\n   1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 2 \\nFIGURE A2-5 \\ne. This strategy essentially accelerates the pi ece part exposure rate as shown in FIGURE \\nA2-5. By iterating on the length of the soft time in terval, a 12,300 cycle value is found to yield a \\nPOF of 1.0 E-09 events for each cycl e, satisfying the DTR criteria. The design would be considered \\nacceptable relative to damage tolerance criteria and the following inspection requirements would be \\nplaced in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness (Step \\n12): \\n(1) Inspect at first piece part exposure. \\n(2) For parts not previously inspected before 12,300 cycles, inspect at first module \\nexposure above 12,300 cycles, soft  time inspection interval. \\n(3) UT inspection calibrated to a #3 FBH. \\n(4) Reject indications equal to or greate r than ½ the response from a number 3 \\nFBH calibration. \\n(5) Include reference to detailed UT inspection procedures. \\nf. The information provided in this section is for example only. Each individual component \\ndesign and engine maintenance practice may require different solutions than those presented here. \\nThe key is that Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness \\nrequirements should reflect actions co nsistent with the analytical a ssumptions made to meet the DTR \\ncriteria. \\nA2-7 \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n      \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n      \\n    \\n   \\n     \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n      3/7/17 AC 33.14-1, Chg 1 \\n Appendix 3 \\nAPPENDIX 3 \\nDEFAULT ANOMALY DISTRIBUTION CURVES \\n1. Anomaly Distri bution Curves \\na. The anomaly distribution curves  associated with ha rd-alpha inclusions in titanium engine\\n \\nrotors are illustrated in this Appendix (FIGURES A3-1 - A3-4). The corresponding tabular data is \\nlisted in Table A3-1 of this Appendix. The fo llowing text provides additional information\\n \\nassociated with the use of these distributions. \\n(1) The distributions are applicable to material that is conventionally \\ninspected in billet form. Here, the term  “conventional” means that the ultrasonic \\ninspection technique treats al l billet radial positions in the same manner (i.e., is not \\nenhanced in a zoned based approach such as that described in AMS 2628) .\\n \\n(2) The distributions are applicable only to hard-alpha inclusions in rotor grade \\n(premium) titanium melted after 1995 using tr iple VAR or CHM plus VAR processes.\\n \\n(3) It is crucial to use the appropriate distribution curve that accurately reflects the \\ninspection sensitivities performed at the billet and forging stages of the manufacturing process. \\n(4) For example, the material must be inspected using UT to at least a\\n \\n#3 FBH with the reject level set at one half that of the calibration level. See Appendix 5 for\\n \\nadditional instructions. Inspections must be performed at both the billet and sonic shape stages. \\n(5) The distribution accounts for all steps required to manu facture a finished part, \\nincluding the in-process billet and sonic shape forging ultrasonic inspections. Therefore, the distribution \\nused should reflect the insp ection sensitivities used in the billet and forging inspections, and should not \\nbe altered. \\n(6) Referring to the FIGURES in this Appendix: \\n(a) The vertical axis represents  the rate (per million pounds) of \\nanomalies exceeding a given size on the horizontal  axis. The curve represents a statistical \\ndistribution of anomaly sizes that ma y be used to assess component risk. \\n(b) The horizontal axis is the inclus ion cross-sectional area including the \\nhard-alpha core and the surrounding diffusion zone.

Use of Default POD Data \\na. This Appendix define s conditions relevant to the us e of accepted estimates of the \\nprobability of detection (POD) for specific t ypes of anomalies and specific nondestructive \\nevaluation/inspection techniques, which may be cons idered as default valu es when applied under \\nappropriately similar co nditions. The conditions defined in  this Appendix do not necessarily \\nguarantee the validity of these POD values. For example, if inspection parameters, such as penetrant \\nconcentration or temperature, are inadequately controlled, the penetrant capability shown in the \\naccompanying graph w ill not be attained, even if the correct penetrant is selected. Use of a written \\nplan for controlling and monitoring inspection processes is recommended (see paragraph 3 of this \\nAppendix). \\nb. If the conditions described for each inspecti on are not satisfied, the resultant inspection \\ncapability and reliability w ill be reduced. Accordingly, the use of the default POD values would then \\nbe inappropriate and would re sult in an overly optimistic da mage tolerance assessment. \\n2. Demonstrations of Inspection Capability \\na. For ECI and ultrasonic inspection techniques, alternative default POD curves are given. \\nChoice of the appropriate POD cu rve must be based on demonstration that the stated calibration \\nand reject signal levels are attainable on the component being inspected, and, for example, not \\nprevented by noise or geometrical features. The de monstration conditions should be appropriate to \\nthe properties of the part inspected that may af fect the inspectability, su ch as surface conditions, \\ndepth to be inspected, proximity to edges, etc. No other demons tration of these default capabilities \\nis necessary, as long as the requirements for the specific inspection technique are satisfied (see \\nparagraphs 3-6 of this Appendix). \\nb. It should be noted that, for specific insp ection techniques applie d under well controlled \\nconditions, it may be possible to achieve POD values  that are significantly better than the default \\nPOD values. Advantage may be taken of any such improved capability  and reliability only if it is \\nsupported by a well documented demonstration \\nA4-1 \\n\\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n      \\n \\n  3/7/17 AC 33.14-1, Chg 1 \\n Appendix 4 \\nprogram. Similarly, a well documented demonstrat ion program may be necessary in order to \\nmeasure POD values appropriate to specific conditions that are excluded from those the default \\nvalues is supported by explicit, reasonable assumptions. \\n3. General Restrictions and Applicability \\na. The inspection process must be well controlled, and performed in accordance with \\nacceptable procedures, such as those defined by the engine st andard practices manual, and \\nconsistent with  good i ndustrial inspection practices, such as  those defined by MIL-STD’s, or \\nequivalent industry standards. \\nb. Pertinent inspection process parameters such  as coverage, probe indexing, and scanning \\nspeeds (see paragraph 4 of Section 3, and paragraphs 4-6 of this Appendix), should be governed by \\nwritten procedures;. Inspection plans and any inspec tion fixturing, should be designed to minimize \\nhuman and other sources of variability. \\nc. Inspectors must be fully qualified a nd trained for each NAS-410, ASNT-TC-1A, \\nATA-105, or equivalent, and provided with adequate tr aining instructions in the specific inspection \\nmethod. \\nd. The default POD data presented in this AC ar e applicable only to titanium alloys used for \\nengine disks, and only to inspect ed material. Geometri cal conditions, such as radii and edges can \\ncreate areas where inspections can not be accomplishe d. Limitations also exist relative to depth of \\npenetration and near surface reso lution. Conditions under which the default POD data were acquired \\nare outlined in paragraphs 4-6 of this Appendi x; advice about the equivalence of alternative \\nconditions should be sought from those with exper tise in NDE. Areas of high compressive residual \\nstress can have negative effects on the capability of various NDE tec hniques, most notably penetrant \\ninspection. \\ne. Applicability of the default POD data is li mited to com ponents exhibiting no abnormal \\nsurface conditions, and that have  been properly cleaned for each  shop manual requirements. No \\nother special pre-inspection cleaning or polishing is required. \\nA4-2 \\n\\n \\n  \\n      \\n    \\n \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  3/7/17 AC 33.14-1, Chg 1 \\n Appendix 4 \\n4. Restrictions and Applicability: ECI \\na. The ECI is an inspection tec hnique suitable for the detecti on of surface or near-surface \\nanomalies. For the purposes of th is document, it is intended primarily for application to engine-run \\ncomponents. The default POD data were acquired under the following conditions: \\n(1) Probes containing absolute  coils, with inspection frequency in the range 2-6 \\nMHz. \\n(2) Probe fixturing capable of following surface contours of the component being \\ninspected, with adequate control of attitude, lift-off and scan indexing. The scan direction was \\nparallel with any uniform feature changes. \\n(3) Provision was made for automatic recordi ng of the inspection process signals or \\nautomated alarm, or both, when the inspection threshold is exceeded. \\nb. The default POD data apply to surface-conn ected low-cycle fatigue cracks. Cracks are \\nassumed to have a 2-to-1 aspect (length:depth) ratio. Crack sizes are expressed in terms of the \\nlength at the surface. Cracks must not be obscured by oxide, contam inants, etc. Inspected surfaces \\nshould be flat, or only moderate ly curved. Choice of the appropriate POD curve from those \\nprovided must be based on compon ent demonstration of the attain able inspection sensitivity (see \\nparagraph 2 of this Appendix). \\n5. Restrictions and Applicability : Penetrant Inspection (PT/FPI) \\na. PT is an inspection technique suitable for the detection of anomalies that are open to the \\ninspected surface. For the purposes of this documen t, it is intended primar ily for application to \\nengine-run components. The default POD data  were acquired under th e following conditions: \\n(1) Fluorescent penetrants qualified as level 4 by AMS-2644 or equivalent, and \\nused with dry powder developer (as a minimum). \\n(2) Application of penetrant and develope r was automated, or for each standard \\npractices; (see, for example,  ASTM E 1417 and AMS-2647). \\nA4-3 \\n\\n  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n \\n   \\n    \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n    \\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 4 \\n(3) Manipulation of the part was possible to present to the inspector an unimpeded \\nview of the surface to be inspected. \\nb. The default POD data apply to surface-conn ected low-cycle fatigue cracks. Cracks are \\nassumed to have a 2-to-1 aspect (length:depth) ratio. Crack sizes are expressed in terms of the \\nlength at the surface. Cracks must not be obscured by oxide, contam inants, etc. Inspected surfaces \\nshould readily visible. Choice of the appropriate POD curve from those provided must be based on \\nwhether focused or full field inspec tion conditions apply, as those term s are defined in paragraph 3 in \\nthe main body of the AC. \\n6. Restrictions and Ap plicability: Ultrason ic Inspection (UT ) \\na. UT is an inspection technique suitable for th e detection of subsurface anomalies. For the \\npurposes of this document, it is intended for application both to billets and to engine-run \\ncomponents. The default POD data were acquired under the following conditions: \\n(1) 5 MHz inspection frequency. \\n(2) Water immersion inspection conditions. \\n(3) Normal incidence longitudinal wave mode for inspection of billet using single 0.5 \\ninch x 1.0 inch cylindrically focused transducer. \\n(4) Shear wave mode for insp ection of finish-machined components using 0.75 inch \\ndiameter spherically focused transducer. \\n(5) Transducer (search unit) fixturing was capable of following surface \\ncontours of the component being inspected, with adequate control of attitude and scan \\nindexing. \\n(6) Provision was made for automatic recording of the inspection \\nprocess signals or automated alarm, or both, when the inspection threshold was exceeded. \\nb. For ultrasonic inspection, the default POD data apply to mixtures of anomalies typical of \\nthose that may be found in billet, or in engine-run material, as appropriate. These anomalies include hard-alpha associated voids or cracks, strain induced porosity, \\nA4-4 \\n\\n    \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n     \\n   1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 4 \\netc. It should be noted that other anomaly types may occur, such as high density inclusions, but \\nthese are not included in the current analysis. A nomaly sizes are expressed in terms of maximum \\ncross-sectional area perpendicular to the sound be am, including associated  diffusion zones where \\nappropriate. \\nc. Inspected finish-machined surfaces should be flat, or only modera tely curved. Billets \\nshould be circular-cylindrical, and in custom ary pre-inspection cond itions (turned, ground, or \\npeeled). \\nd. Choice of the appropriate POD curve from those provided must be based on component \\ndemonstration of the attainable inspection sensitiv ity (see paragraph 2 of th is Appendix). Provision \\nmust be made to maintain this sensitivity at a ll depths, and effective dist ance-amplitude compensation \\nis required. \\nA4-5 \\n\\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\nAppendix 5 \\nAPPENDIX 5 \\nDEFAULT POD CURVES \\nA5-1 \\n\\n \\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 5 \\nFIGURE A5-1 \\nPOD FOR FLUORESCENT PENETRANT INSPECTION OF \\nFINISH-MACHINED SURFACES \\nA5-2 \\n\\n 1/8/01 AC 33.14-1 \\n Appendix 5 \\nFIGURE A5-2 \\nMEAN (50% CONFIDENCE) POD FOR ULTRASONIC\\nINSPECTION OF FIELD COMPONENTS \\n#1 FBH (1/64 INCH DIA.)

On February 23, 1984, the Federal Aviation \\nAdministration (FAA) published Amendment 10 to FAR Part 33 to \\nupdate and modernize the technical requirements applicable to the \\ntype certification of aircraft engines. The portions applicable \\nto the containment of rotor blade failures modified the \\nrequirements for turbine engines, FAR 33.19(a), and added new \\nSection 33.94, Blade Containment and Rotor Unbalance Tests. The \\nguidance in this AC supersedes the rotor blade containment \\nportions of AC No. 33-lB, Turbine Engine Foreign Object Ingestion \\nand Rotor Blade Containment Type Certification Procedures. \\n5. DEFINITIONS. The following are defined for the purposes of this AC. \\nAC 33-5 06/18/90 \\na. Maximum permissible rpm means the maximum rotor speed, \\nincluding transient speeds, as specified by the type certificate \\ndata sheet. \\nb. critical rotor blade means the compressor or fan blade, \\nand the turbine blade, which when released provides the most \\nchallenge to the containment structure (i.e., the least difference \\nbetween the penetration capability of the resultant material \\nreleased and the containment capability of the surrounding engine \\nstructure) and the most rotor imbalance. The penetration \\ncapability of the material released is affected by its shape, \\norientation at impact, material properties, and kinetic energy. \\nc. Contained means that no fragments are released through \\nthe engine structure, but fragments may be ejected out the engine \\nair inlet or exhaust. \\nd. Engine structure means the engine structure surrounding \\nthe main rotors and extending from the forward-most case flange \\nthrough the rear-most flange, as defined by the type design. \\n6. DISCUSSION. \\na. General. \\n(1) The potential hazard resulting from an uncontained \\nturbine engine rotor blade failure has been a long-term concern of \\nthe FAA. Part 33 of the FAR has always required the engine to be \\ndesigned to contain damage resulting from rotor blade failure. \\nAmendment 10 to FAR Part 33 introduced new Section 33.94 which \\nrequires blade containment and rotor unbalance tests. \\n(2) The containment of failed rotor blades is a complex \\nprocess which involves high energy, high speed interactions of \\nnumerous locally and remotely located engine components (e.g., \\nfailed blade, other blades, containment structure, adjacent cases, \\nbearings, bearing supports, shafts, vanes, and externally mounted \\ncomponents). once the failure event starts, secondary events of a \\nrandom nature may occur whose course and ultimate conclusion \\ncannot b,e precisely predicted. Some of the structural \\ninteractions that have been observed to affect containment are the \\ndeformation and/or deflection of blades, cases, rotor, frame, \\ninlet, casing rub strips, and the containment structure. \\nb. Design and Construction. \\n(1) FAR Section 33.19(a), Durability, requires that: \\nPage 2 PAR 5 \\n06/18/90 AC 33-5 \\n(i) The engine design and construction must minimize \\nthe development of an unsafe condition between overhaul periods. \\n(ii) The design of the engine cases must provide for \\nthe containment of damage from rotor blade failures. \\n(iii) The energy levels and trajectories of fragments \\nresulting from a rotor blade failure that lie outside the compressor \\nand turbine rotor cases must be defined. \\n(2) FAR Sections 33.19 and 33.94 affect the following: \\n(i) The design of engine structure to contain failed \\nblades. \\n(ii) The design of engine cases, rotor and static \\nstructure, shafts, bearings, and mounts to withstand the resulting \\nloads without hazard to the aircraft. \\n(3) The applicant should provide as part of the \\ncertification data, the necessary information to permit assessment \\nof the critical rotor blade. Analysis of the critical blade should \\ninclude, as a minimum, the following considerations: \\n(i) The containment structure should be at the worst \\ntemperature and stress condition associated with operation at \\nmaximum permissible rpm. The effective structure thickness should \\nbe at the minimum allowed by the type design. \\n(ii) The maximum permissible rpm should be used for \\neach rotor stage evaluated. \\n(iii) It is possible that the maximum containment \\nstructure temperature will not result in the least resistance to \\nblade penetration and rotor unbalance loads, A few structural \\nmaterials (notably carbon composites) actually increase in strength \\nwith increasing temperature. Therefore, if there is a worse \\nrealistic combination (of rotor rpm, and containment structure \\ntemperature and stress) for the particular type design than (i) and \\n(ii) a~ove, it should also be included in the analysis. (However, it is believed to be unlikely that a lower rpm/ temperature \\ncombination will produce a worse overall threat to engine structural \\nintegrity because of the accompanying decreases in projectile \\nkinetic energy and rotor unbalance loads.) \\n(iv) The mass of the initial failed blade should be \\nthe maximum allowed by the type design, with the failure location ~s \\ndefined in FAR 33.94(a). It is possible that a blade with an \\nPAR 6 \\nAC 33-5 06/18/90 \\nintegral tip shroud will produce less of a penetration threat than \\na lighter blade without an integral tip shroud (owing to the \\nlatter\\'s smaller shear-plug area and higher contact pressure). In \\nthis case, both blades should be considered in the analysis. \\n(v) Effects of the secondary damage, if any, \\nresulting from the failure of one blade should be evaluated. For \\nexample, if a single blade failure liberates part or all of the \\nremaining blades in that stage or other stages, the resultant \\nliberated mass, kinetic energy, and unbalance loads should be \\nconsidered in determining criticality. There may be development \\nexperience with the subject type design, or service experience \\nwith a similar type design, that will provide insight to these effects. \\n(vi) The maximum kinetic energy (translational and \\nrotational) of a single blade failure without dissipation during \\nsecondary damage (i.e., maximum piercing potential) should be \\nused. \\nc. Engine Tests. \\n(1) Engine Configuration. The engine used for the \\ncontainment and unbalance tests must meet the type design for \\nthose items deemed influential to the test results. Influential \\nitems include, but are not limited to, case thickness, retention \\nof external components, blade design, rotor structure, and rotor \\nsupport structure. A typical aircraft inlet and typical aircraft \\nexhaust nozzle/ducting, or equivalent (i.e., having the same \\nattachment loads and reactions which influence engine case \\ndeflections, containment capability, and engine vibratory \\nresponse), should be used. \\n(2) conditions. The engine may be tested at nominal sea \\nlevel conditions, and: \\n(i) The critical blade should be released at the \\nmaximum permissible rpm with the engine rotor and static structure \\nat the worst associated operating temperatures and stresses, or at \\nany other realistic combination of rpm, temperature, and stress \\nagreed to be more critical. \\n(ii) High speed photography and witness shields are \\nrecommended as means of determining the trajectories and energy \\nlevels of fragments that might be ejected out the engine air inlet \\nor exhaust, or that might be released through the wall(s) of the \\nengine casing. Any fragment(s) penetrating and escaping through \\nthe engine casing (including any containment wrapping that is \\npartof the engine type design) will normally be cause for failing \\nthe test. Even if the penetrating fragments have low retained \\nPage 4 PAR 6 \\n06/18/90 \\t AC 33-5 \\nkinetic energy (after exiting), the engine\\'s containment capability \\nmust be considered extremely marginal. The energy levels and \\ntrajectories of any fragments exiting the inlet or exhaust should be \\nincluded in the engine installation manual for consideration by the \\nairframe engineers. \\n(iii) For some engine type designs, it may be necessary \\nto conduct tests which are more severe than the release of one \\nblade. For example, a certain turbine may be designed to prevent \\ndisk burst, upon loss of output shaft load, by shedding its blades. \\nContainment would be required for this condition by FAR 33.75. If \\nthe same turbine blade were found to be the most critical under FAR \\n33.94, and a loss of load/ blade shedding test successfully \\ndemonstrated structural integrity, it would not be necessary to \\nperform the 33.94 test for the turbine because the demonstrated \\nkinetic energy for penetration and unbalance loads would exceed the \\nFAR 33.94 requirements. \\n(iv) Following release of the critical blade, no \\nengine control may be adjusted by the operator for at least 15 \\nseconds after indication of excessive vibration or other evidence \\nthat would be available to the pilot, in order to simulate crew \\nrecognition and reaction time and determine the short term effects \\nof operation with this unbalance. \\n(3) Test Results. The engine is acceptable if: \\n(i) At completion of the test, the damage resulting \\nfrom a critical rotor blade failure is contained by the engine \\nstructure, and \\n(ii) The resultant loads do not cause: distortion of \\nthe engine casing, separation of case flanges, rotor unstacking, or \\nother damage, if any of the foregoing would result in a hazardous \\ncondition for a typical installation; fire (external or internal); \\nor failure of the engine mounting attachments; and \\n(iii) Either the engine continues to run for at least \\n15 seconds after indication of excessive vibration or other evidence \\nthat w,ould be available to the pilot, and then can be successfully \\nshut down; or the resulting engine damage \\nanytime after initial blade release. \\n/ ~ / l-_. \\n\\' J k A.

PURPOSE. This advisory circular (AC) provides guidance material and \\ninformation relating to detonation testing for reciprocating aircraft engines. \\nThe methods presented in this AC are not necessarily applicable to engines \\nusing alcohol or alcohol/gasoline type fuels. Guidance contained in this AC \\ndoes not constitute a regulation and, therefore, is not mandatory. \\nAdditionally, it is not necessarily the only means of showing compliance with \\napplicable airworthiness requirements. \\n2. RELATED FAR SECTIONS. FAR Part 33, Section 33.47, and CAR Part 13, \\nSection 13.153. \\n3. BACKGROUND. This AC, relating to engine certification substantiation \\nprocedures, is intended to assist in establishing uniformity in the \\ncertification process and in the pre-certification test planning by defining \\ncertain terms and procedures which may be of assistance in meeting the related \\nregulations. AC 23-909-1, Installation of Turbochargers in Small Airplanes \\nwith Reciprocating Engines, may be of further assistance. \\n4. DEFINITIONS. \\na. Detonation. The spontaneous combustion of an unburned charge which \\noccurs ahead of the flame front after normal ignition. Frequency and severity \\nof detonation is defined as follows: \\n5-9 flashes/minute= incipient detonation; 10-20 flashes/minute= \\nlimiting detonation. \\nb. Preignition. The uncontrolled ignition of a charge prior to the \\noccurrence of normal ignition. \\nc. Turbocharger. Any exhaust gas-driven device that is added to or part \\nof a reciprocating engine. This definition applies to: \\n(1) Engines turbonormalized having a turbocharger that maintains \\napproximately sea level manifold pressure to a critical altitude. \\n(2) Engines turbosupercharged having a turbocharger that provides a \\nmanifold pressure greater than that of a normally aspirated engine at sea \\nlevel conditions and maintains this pressure to a critical altitude. \\nAC 33.47-1 6/27/88 \\nd. Supercharged Engine. An engine having a mechanical air-charging \\ndevice (compressor) that provides a manifold pressure equal or greater than \\nthat of a normally aspirated engine at sea level conditions and maintains this \\nmanifold pressure to a critical altitude. \\ne. Intercooler. Any device installed in the engine induction air system \\nat the exit of turbocharger or supercharger compressor intended to reduce the \\ntemperature of air compressed by the turbocharger. \\nf. Fuel Mixture Runs. -A series of fuel mixture response curves run at \\nvarious powers and speeds to determine an operating envelope free of \\ndetonation. \\ng. Rated Takeoff Power. The approved brake horsepower that is developed \\nstatically under standard sea level conditions within the engine operating \\nlimitations established under Part 33, and limited in use to periods of not \\nover 5 minutes of operation. \\nh. Takeoff Power. -The brake horsepower that is developed under standard \\nsea level conditions, and under the maximum conditions of crankshaft \\nrotational speed and engine manifold pressure approved for the normal takeoff, \\nand limited in continuous use to the period of time shown in the approved \\nengine specification. \\ni. Critical Altitude. The maximum altitude at which, in standard \\natmosphere, it is possible to maintain at a specified rotational speed, a \\nspecified power, or a specified manifold pressure. Unless otherwise stated, \\nthe critical altitude is the maximum altitude at which it is possible to \\nmaintain, at the maximum continuous rotational speed, one of the following: \\n(1) The maximum continuous power, in the case of engines for which \\nthis power rating is the same at sea level and at the rated altitude. \\n(2) The maximum continuous rated manifold pressure, in the case of \\nengines, the maximum continuous power of which is governed by a constant \\nmanifold pressure. \\nj. Standard Atmosphere. -A hypothetical vertical distribution of \\ntemperature, pressure, and density in the atmosphere used for instrument \\ncalibrations and aircraft performance calculations. The current standard was \\nadopted, by international agreement, in 1962 by the U.S. Committee on \\nExtension to the Standard Atmosphere. The u.s. standard has been adopted by \\nthe International Civil Aeronautical Organization (ICAO) up to 105,000 feet. \\nk. Standard Sea Level Conditions. -The value of temperature, \\npressure, and density at sea level in the standard atmosphere. \\n(tempera§ure = S9°F (1s0 c), pressure= 29.92 in. Hg, density; 0.0023769 \\nslugs/ft ). \\n2 \\nAC 33.47-16/27/88 \\n1. Standard Hot Day. -The hypothetical vertical temgerature variation in \\nthe atmosphere starting at a sea level temperature of 103 F (39.4°C) and \\nhaving the same lapse rate (up to 36,089 ft) as the standard atmosphere. The \\nspecified sea level pressure for a hot day is the same as for a standard day. \\n5. RELATIONSHIP TO ENGINE CERTIFICATION PROCEDURES. \\na. The detonation margin of reciprocating airplane engines at various \\npower settings is related primarily to induction air inlet temperature and \\npressure, cylinder head temperature, engine exhaust back pressure, ignition \\ntiming, fuel grade, fuel flow, carburetor or injector metering \\ncharacteristics, compression ratio, and cooling margins. Other features, such \\nas cylinder combustion chamber design, induction system design and \\ndistribution, are also involved to a lesser degree. Changes to design \\nfeatures for purpose of meeting the detonation margin, such as compression \\nratio, ignition timing, and fuel metering and endurance characteristics may \\nrequire re-certification of an engine. \\nb. The addition of a turbocharger to an engine not certified with it or a \\nchange in the engine turbocharger of a certified combination may affect \\ndetonation margin. If the original margin is small, unsatisfactory detonation \\ncharacteristics may result. Turbocharging can also be expected to have an \\neffect on induction system distribution. \\nc. For a turbocharged engine, induction air temperature may become \\ncritical at altitude because of the increased compression of air required. \\nThe turbocharger speed will also increase with altitude because increased \\nturbine wheel speed is necessary to achieve the required pressure ratio to \\nmaintain manifold pressure. If detonation characteristics are unsatisfactory, \\nchanges of one or more of the other primary factors may be necessary to \\nrestore detonation margins. Refer to AC 23.909-1, Installation of \\nTurbochargers in Small Airplanes with Reciprocating Engines, for additional \\nguidance with turbocharged applications. \\nd. A detonation survey must be performed for the approval of a \\nturbocharged engine installed in an airframe to verify that the detonation \\nmargins are still within acceptable limits and that the installation has not \\ncaused any detrimental effect related to detonation. \\ne. Whenever a power or performance increase is requested (i.e. \\n·turbocharged \\t installation, higher manifold pressure, higher induction \\ntemperature, intercooler installation) a satisfactory detonation survey must \\nbe performed prior to approval. \\n6. DETONATION TEST \\nThe detonation tests are intended to demonstrate that there is a \\nsatisfactory margin against the occurrence of detonation for the most critical \\noperating conditions to be approved for the engine as installed in an \\naircraft. \\n3 \\nAC 33.47-1 6/ 27 /88 \\nThe detonation test should be specified to cover power settings throughout \\nthe entire operating envelope using fuel of minimum specified octane. The \\nusual method of doing this is to take successive power readings with the \\nmixture leaned out progressively to the point of incipient detonation or where \\nthe engine cuts out. Intake air temperatures for detonation testing should \\naccount for the heat rise requirements for induction system icing protection. \\nDuring the tests the engine should be operated with intake air at a \\ntemperature which complies with the intended class of aircraft preheated \\nregulator requirements. For fuel injected engines, the intake air temperature \\nshould be commensurate with hot day condition. At least one cylinder should \\nbe within 10°F of the maximum permissible temperature value for cylinder head \\nand cylinder barrel. (See also b., below) \\nDetonation testing should address the following considerations over the \\noperating range for which engine approval is sought. In addition to sea level \\ntesting, sufficient altitude or simulated altitude testing should be conducted \\nfor turbocharged or supercharged engines to verify freedom from detonation \\nwith an appropriate margin for safety. \\na. The detonation survey should consist of a series of fuel mixture runs \\nand be made with oil inlet temperatures within plus or minus 10°F of limiting \\ntemperatures. The induction air temperature should be held to minus zero of \\nthat specified for a standard hot day at the particular altitude in question. \\nb. Cylinder head temperature should be maintained by regulating the \\ncooling air differential pressure at the start of each fuel mixture control \\nrun in such a manner that the peak temperature reached by the hottest cylinder \\nduring leaning will be not more than 10° below the maximum specified engine \\nlimit. The temperature of all other cylinder heads should be maintained \\nwithin so°F of the hottest cylinder. \\nc. Detonation tests should define detonation characteristics throughout \\nthe operating envelope, including takeoff power and engine RPM (if \\napplicable), rated power and engine RPM, and high and low cruise powers. It \\nmay be necessary to run tests at powers between high and low cruise to \\ndetermine the maximum power setting at which detonation free operation exists \\nduring fuel mixture leaning. Care must be exercised to hold speed and power \\nas close to the desired values as possible while leaning out the fuel mixture. \\nDetonation testing based on evaluation ef the maximum temperature cylinder \\nonly is not acceptable. \\nd. For naturally aspirated and single speed geared supercharged engines, \\nthe data should be taken at sea level pressure altitude. For turbocharged \\nengines or engines using turbochargers and mechanical superchargers, the data \\nshould be obtained throughout the engine operating envelope. If an \\nintercooler is used, then the induction ~ir should be controlled to the \\nmaximum permissible temperature at each power setting and altitude. \\n4 \\n6/27/88 \\t AC 33.47-1 \\ne. The detonation tendencies should be observed by standard laboratory \\nmethods. The fuel mixture should be varied from full-rich to either limiting \\ndetonation, maximum allowable turbocharger temperature, best economy mixture, \\nor power instability. Minimum fuel mixture margin should be 12 percent above \\nlimiting detonation. It is also necessary to show that the leanest fuel/air \\nratio allowable for the fuel metering device used is 12 percent richer than \\nlimiting detonation. The engine should not demonstrate any detonation \\ncharacteristics at the minimum fuel flow specified for any operating \\ncondition. Engine power settings through the engine operating envelope should \\nbe tested to verify establishment of adequate detonation margins. The engine \\nshould not demonstrate limiting detonation at fuel flows down to 12 percent \\nleaner than the minimum fuel flow recommended by the engine fuel flow chart. \\nf. In order to obtain certification to permit the use of a lower grade \\nfuel, a satisfactory detonation test must be completed with the lower grade \\nfuel. \\n7. TEST FUEL. A sample of fuel used during testing should be submitted to an \\napproved or acceptable independent testing facility for analysis. The fuel \\nshould be analyzed in comparison with the properties specified for the fuel \\ntype approved for use with the engine. The specified properties will normally \\nbe detailed in either the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) \\nD910 for aviation fuel, or ASTM D439 for automotive fuel. The test fuel \\nshould be controlled to the low end of the octane rating. \\n8.

This AC focuses on PBF AM for metallic \\nmaterials, where the feedstock material in the form of alloyed or elemental powder is \\nfused by lasers or electron beams in to a near-finished final shape. \\n5.2 PBF AM materials are very process dependent . It is important that design values used \\nfor PBF AM materials reflect not only the variability of the feedstock materials as purchased by manufacturers, but also the variability introduced by the manufacturing \\nprocess used to fabricate production parts. While PBF AM methods have many process \\nparameters (more than 100) identified by AM  experts, studies have shown that the \\nactual number of key process variables may be much smaller. Key process variables \\ninclude elements of the AM process th at could affect the chemical, physical, \\nmetallurgical, dimensional, or mechanical properties of the part. Defining the key \\nprocess variables for a specific AM process application, including th e level of control \\nrequired to yield capability for producing parts in a stable and repeatable manner, is key \\nto successful implementation of additive manufacturing. \\nFor life-limited parts, additional information beyond the scope of this AC may be \\nrequired to demonstrate compliance with § 33.14, Stop-start cyclic stress (low-cycle \\nfatigue) at amendment 33-10 (49 FR 6836, February 23, 1984) and § 33.70, Engine life-\\nlimited parts . \\n5 \\n6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n6 MATERIAL DESIGN VALUES. \\n6.1 Fundamentals . \\n6.1.1 Compliance with § 33.15 requires that suitability and durability of materials “be \\nestablished on the basis of experience or test s; and conform to approved specifications.” \\nFor cases where sufficient experience and/or approved specifications do not exist, \\nmaterial design values for AM parts should be established through test. This testing \\nmay be conducted using specimens produced with feedstock materials and process parameters representative of parameters used to produce AM parts, including post-processing operations, or with a combinati on of component level testing and specimen \\ntesting. Test specimens should represent multiple builds, build locations, specimen orientations (including height  in the build chamber), specimen thickness, and feedstock \\npowder lots. Resultant test specimens shoul d conform to the material and process \\nspecifications defined for AM parts. \\n6.1.2 Alternately, applicants may rely on component  testing supported by statistical analysis \\nto demonstrate mechanical properties of AM parts provided that this approach fully demonstrates that final part mechanical  properties meet design requirements. \\n6.2 Specimen Testing Considerations. \\nAfter establishing sufficient process and qua lity controls to consistently produce AM \\nparts, substantiation of material design values can be achieved by testing specimens \\nextracted from representative parts or direct ly produced specimens. In either case, the \\napplicant should demonstrate that these specimens appropriately represent the variability and corresponding properties in parts fabricated by the AM production \\nprocess. \\n6.2.1 Validating Process Windows. \\nSpecimens used to establish material desi gn values should address the range (i.e., \\nwindow) of process variation a llowed in the frozen proces s specification including, but \\nnot limited to the following: \\n•Laser or electron beams parameter windows. \\n•Purge gas purity possible ranges. \\n•Energy source performance possible ranges. \\n•Powder reuse possible ranges (see paragraph 8.1.2. in this AC). \\n6 \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n6.2.2 Test and Laboratory Procedures. \\nThe metallurgical, mechanical, and physical property test and\\n laboratory procedures \\nused to demonstrate the capabilities of AM metallic materials produced should conform \\nto approved specifications and meet the following requirements: \\n•Laboratory and test procedures used for this purpose should be performed by a   \\nqualified laboratory that conforms to accepted standards provided by technical \\nsocieties, such as the ASTM, SAE, the National Aerospace and Defense       \\nContractors Accreditation Program (NADCAP) or equivalent.\\n•The test facility should demonstrate competence through International Organization\\nfor Standardization/International El ectrotechnical Commission (ISO/IEC) 17025\\naccreditation, or equivalent, or by a recognized accreditation body.\\nThe applicant should identify the standards an d specifications used to conduct each test \\nprocedure, including AM specific considerations when appropriate, and provide \\nevidence of accreditation for the labo ratory that performed the test\\n. \\nNote: Documented company internal test standard s may be used if these standards have \\nbeen revi\\newed and accepted by the FAA. Wh en company test standards are used, the \\ncompany should have an internal process for ensuring that the testing is conducted in accordance with the prescribed test procedure. \\n6.3 Building Block Approach . \\nDesign values should be developed as part of an overall progra m to establish the \\ncapability of a component to meet design objectives. Design values should be reliably established through a program of statistical analysis and a series of tests conducted \\nusing specimens of varying levels of comple xity. Often referred to in industry as the \\n“building block” approach, these tests and analyses at the coupon, details, and \\ncomponent levels can be used to quantify vari ations that could be present in the final \\nAM part in an economically feasible manner. The lessons learned from initial tests help avoid early failures in more complex part level tests, which are costlier to conduct and \\noften occur later in a certif ication program schedule. Fi gure 1 provides a conceptual \\nschematic of tests included  in a building block approach for a PBF AM engine \\ncomponent. \\n7 \\n, , , , , \\' ,, \\n, > \\nCOMPON !NTS \\n, \\n\\' \\' \\' \\' \\n, \\' , . \\' , \\' ·~\\' \\\\ \\n, \\' \\' ·~------~ / 1 D!TAILS r\\\\ \\n, \\' , \\' , \\' , \\' \\' \\' \\' \\' , \\' , \\n\\' , , , Support Remnants \\' \\nThin Walls .\\\\,. \\nOvorhangs \\\\ , _____ ------· ---· ------------....... ----\\' , \\' \\n/ COUPONS I \\\\ \\n\\' \\' :\\' ... _.,. ____ _,__.., D=G \\\\\\\\ \\n~----------------------------------· 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\nFigure 1. Schematic Diagram of Building Block Tests for an Engine Component \\n8 \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n6.4 Material Design Value Considerations. \\n6.4.1 Material strength and design values used fo r AM parts need to ac count for variability \\ndue to the feedstock materials and producti on methods used to manufacture a part. In \\ngeneral, the variability of the material in  the final part is accounted for by using \\nstatistical tools to analyze data obtained from testing of specimens extracted from \\nactual parts or purpose-built specimens. \\n6.4.2 Data used to derive design values shou ld be obtained from stable and repeatable \\nfeedstock material procured per a controlled material specification. The material should \\nbe processed with a stable and repeatable process per a representative manufacturing \\nprocess specification and with process va lidation that establishes significant key \\nprocess variables that are de fined by a frozen process window. This approach ensures \\nthat the variability permitted in manufactured  materials is captured in the statistical \\nanalysis used to derive the design values . Design values derived too early in the \\nmaterial’s development stage, before f eedstock material and AM part production \\nprocesses have matured and are demonstrat ed to be stable, may not satisfy the \\nrequirements of § 33.15. As with traditional manufacturing processes, actual part \\ndesign features and processing, including th ermal effects, environmental effects, and \\ngeometric features that impact material properties should be addressed. \\n6.4.3 Characterizing Material Anisotropy. \\nDepending on process param\\neters, resulting parts may exhibit anisotropic material \\nbehavior. Specimen testing should be perf ormed with specimen s representing XY and \\nZ orientations, as well as the full build height  used to produce parts (see Figure 2 in this \\nAC). If the results of this testing indicate a directional variation in properties, design \\nvalues should be developed for each orientat ion or the orientation yielding the lowest \\nproperties should be conser\\nvatively considered when establishing the minimum \\nbaseline design values. \\nFigure 2. Orientation of XY and Z Directions \\n9 \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n6.4.4 Establishing Design Values. \\nDesign values are established using \\nindustr y accepted solid test specimens with \\nmachined external surfaces. Material pr operties generated from these specimens \\nrepresent material properties that can be produced with the selected feedstock material \\nusing the frozen AM process parameters including (if required) post-fabrication \\noperations, such as stress relief cycles a nd other thermal cycles including HIP. Design \\nminimums for AM materials should be estab lished using industry accepted standards, \\nsuch as the Metallic Materi als Properties Development a nd Standardization (MMPDS) \\nHandbook with the same rigor and requirem\\nents as minimum design values for \\nconventionally processed materials. \\nNote: Design valu\\nes are only applicable for AM parts that are solid, fully machined on \\nall surfaces, and do not have geometric features  that require the use of additional debits \\nto baseline material design values. \\n6.4.5 Establishing Thermal Exposure Debits. \\n6.4.5.1 Many AM parts will have elevated  temperature exposures during post-\\nfabrication processing and/or dur ing exposure to engine operating \\nconditions. Examples of post-fabric ation thermal exposures include \\nthermal exposures associated with coating application a nd brazing cycles, \\nHIP cycles, etc. These elevated temp erature exposures can reduce actual \\nmaterial baseline values below minimum baseline design values. \\n6.4.5.2 Specimen testing should be perfor med with specimens processed through \\nall required post-fabrication therma l exposures and expected operating \\nconditions. If the results of this te sting indicate a difference between \\ndesign values for specimens subjected to thermal exposures and the minimum baseline design values, the results of thermal exposure specimen \\ntesting should be used to establish a thermal exposure specific debit that \\nshould be applied to the minimum baseline design values. \\n6.4.6 Establishing Part Feature Debits. \\n6.4.6.1 Depending on part complexity, AM part s may include unique features that \\ncan result in material values that are lower than the minimum baseline \\ndesign values established by the data obtained from testing described in \\nparagraph 6.4.1. Part features that can impact material values include \\nfeatures such as holes, internal passages, and overhanging surfaces as well as thin wall sections, stress concentr ations associated with removal of \\nsupports, and as-deposited surfaces. \\n10 \\nVl \\nVl \\nCl) .... ..., \\nVl \\n00 \\nC ·..:; \\nro \\nC .... \\n2 \\n<i -----\\n·-. . ...._.-..-. . ....__-4vera.oe \\n-... ........

For example, if the final part includes \\nas-fabricated surfaces, test specimens should be created with as-fabricated \\nsurfaces such that testing evaluates the effect of the actual part surface \\ncondition on overall material propertie s. If the results of this testing \\nindicate a property debit for specimens  with representative features as \\ncompared to the minimum baseline desi gn values, the re sults of feature-\\nspecific specimen testing should be used to establish a feature-specific \\ndebit that should be applied to the minimum baseline design values. \\n6.4.7 Establishing Final Design Values. \\nFigure 3 depicts how the final design \\nvalues are to be used with AM parts. The final \\ndesign values are established by applying the debits determined by the testing described \\nin paragraphs 6.4.5 and 6.4.6 to the m\\ninimum baseline material design values \\nestablished by the data obtained from testing described in paragraph 6.4.1. \\nFigure 3. Example of Establishing Final Design Values \\n11 \\n \\n \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n7 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS. \\n7.1 Part Design Considerations. \\nParts manufactured using AM require unique considerations not typically pertinent \\nwhen using traditional manufact uring techniques. The resul ting microstructures for AM \\nmaterial may vary significantly from cast or wrought microstructures for the same \\nmaterial. Layer-by-layer processing may genera te directionally oriented microstructure \\nthat can result in both local and directiona l anisotropy. As with other melt processes, \\nanomalies such as porosity, unmelted particle s, and lack of fusion can occur with the \\nAM process and should be understood and c ontrolled. Furthermore, the physics of the \\nlayered AM process is such that anomalies tend to for\\nm along the build plane and may \\nnot have significant height in the bui ld direction making detection difficult. \\n7.2 Part Orient\\nation. \\nA part’s orientation relative to the build platform can have a si gnificant impact on the \\nmaterial properties of the final pa rt (e.g., anisotropy, residual stress, or \\nunsupported/\\noverhanging surfaces). Part orientat ion should be considered as part of the \\ndesign process to ensure final material properties meet part requirements. \\n7.3 Dimensional Control. \\nDifferent AM processes/parame\\nter combinati ons provide different dimensional control \\ncapabilities. The capability of the selected AM process/parameter combination to create \\nessential part features, such as minimum and maximum wall thickness and fillet radii, \\nshould be considered during the design proce ss. Localized heat input associated with \\nAM processes used with metallic materials can result in the creation of significant \\nresidual stress in the fabricated part. Th ese stresses and potential post processing \\nwarpage should be accounted for in the design process and associated mechanical property analysis. If post-processing thermal cy cles, such as stress relief thermal cycles \\nor HIP cycles are employed, dim\\nensional control for the final part should be \\ndemonstrated after all post-processing thermal cycles have been completed. \\n7.4 Surface Condition. \\nThe surface conditions associated with AM processes can be significantly \\ndifferent \\nfrom surface conditions produced by traditiona l subtractive manufacturing approaches. \\n7.4.1 \\nSurface Finish. \\nThe surface finish of an AM part can\\n vary significantly depending on the selected AM \\nmodality, machine, machine parameters, feedst ock material, and orientation of a given \\nsurface. For this reason, the surface finish  can vary significantly as a function of \\nlocation on a part. Surface finish values  should be determ\\nined during the part \\ndevelopment process and reflected in the design values. \\n12 \\n\"Unsupportecl·Arch\" \"Overhanging·Surfaces\" \\n35 degrus 30 degrus 10 degrees \\n,\\'fl\\'S LPBF) \\n\"Self-Supporting·Structures\" 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n7.4.2 Feature Related Surface Conditions. \\nDue to the layer-by-layer addition of m\\naterial that occurs with AM processes, varying \\nsurface cond\\nitions can be crea ted during the formation of features, such as unsupported \\narches, overhanging surfaces, and self-supporting structures (see Figure 4 in this AC). \\nFigure 4. Unique Feature Related Surface Conditions \\n7.4.3 \\nSurface Condition Impact – Mechanical Properties. \\nMechanical properties th\\nat are sensitive to surface condi tion will require detailed \\ncharacterization to establish mechanical prop erty debits associated with the surface \\ncondition as describe d in paragraph 6.4.6.2. \\n7.4.4 Surface \\nCondition Impact – Inspectability Limits. \\nThe surface condition associated with AM pr ocesses can also im\\npact inspectability \\nlimits associated with conventional NDI processes. Depending on the surface condition \\nresulting from selected processing, part surfaces may require NDI process \\ndevelopment. The requirement is to demonstrate adequate resolution to detect the specified defect size (see paragraph 10.6). \\n7.4.5 \\nSurface Finishing Considerations. \\nTraditional surface finishing approaches, includin\\ng non-conventional methods, can be \\napplied to both external and internal surfaces of AM parts. However, complex internal \\ngeometries associated with some AM parts may not be accessible. Parts designed to operate with the as-fabricated  surface conditions should incl ude associated mechanical \\nproperty debits where such surface conditions exist on the part. See figure 3 in this AC. \\n13 \\ndditi \\nPart \\nUpp rt 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n7.4.6 Protective Coating Considerations. \\nStandard protective coatings, such as coa tings used to address corrosion, oxidation, or \\nerosion can typically be applied to both extern al and internal surfaces of AM parts that \\nhave been s\\nubjected to surface finish\\ning tr eatments. Application of coatings on as-\\nfabricated internal passages may be diffi cult due to as-fabricated surface conditions. \\n7.5 Support Structures. \\nSupport structures can be used to mi\\nnimize the occurrence of unsupported arches and \\noverhanging surfaces. Additionally, support structures can be used to help transfer heat \\naway from local areas as new layers are added and to help retain the part’s shape. For \\nan example of the use of support structures  during the AM PBF build process, see \\nFigure 5. \\nFigure 5. Example of Support Struct ures Used with Additive Parts \\n7.6 Note: There are drawbacks to the use of support structures during AM. Supports \\nform\\ned inside parts cannot be removed after part fabrication. Removal of supports from \\nexternal surfaces can result in the creation of  local stress concentrations that can have \\ndeleterious effects on mechanical properties. \\nPowder Removal. \\nWhen PBF AM processes are used to produ ce parts with internal features, unfused \\npowder can become trapped inside the part du ring the build process. Part designs and \\npart orientation during the build process shoul d be defined such that removal of loose \\npowder can be accomplished. Effective powder removal procedures should be identified. For cases where powder removal may not be accomplis hed, functional tests \\nshould be performed to verify that any poten tial residual powder doe s not interfere with \\nintended function of the part. \\n14 \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\nNote: Failure to remove loose powder before application of post- processing therm\\nal \\ncycles can result in sintering of loose powder to the parts internal surfaces such that the \\nloose powder can no longer be removed. \\n8 MATERI AL AND FABRICATION. \\n8.1 Material and Process Control . \\nDepending on the selected PBF AM \\nprocess, more than 100 parameters may be used to \\ncontrol the fusion process. Examples of ke y process variables re quiring control include \\ndirected energy source power, scan speeds,  layer thickness, fill patterns, chamber \\natmosphere, chamber temperature, feedstock material, and reuse of feedstock material. \\nProcess parameters that have a direct influe nce on the chemical, physical, metallurgical, \\ndimensional, or mechanical properties of  the final AM part should be identified, \\ndefined as key process variables, and carefully controlled. Process validation is the \\nsystem that defines how to identify signifi cant process parameters, identifies their \\nlimits, and determines if they have a deleterious effect on the defined requirements. Specifications covering AM feedstock material, including reuse of  feedstock material, \\nmaterial processing, and fabrication proce dures should be established in conjunction \\nwith process validation to ensure a basis for fabricating reproducible and reliable \\nm\\naterial. \\n8.1.1 \\nFeedstock Material Specification. \\n8.1.1.1 For powder-based AM processes, co ntrol of the powder feedstock is \\nessential to a quality fusion process. The key characteristics of the powder, \\nsuch as powder chemistry, particle  shape, particle size distribution \\n(including size limits), cleanliness, an d powder flow characteristics should \\nbe identified and defined in the feedstock specification along with acceptance testing requirements. The feedstock specification should also \\nidentify the powder production method. \\n8.1.1.2 Specifications for feedstock material s limit the variation in composition, \\ntrace elements, impurities, and other characteristics that are inherent to the feedstock material form based on material performance sensitivity studies. These specifications are required to en sure consistent material is being \\nprocured. Feedstock material specifi cations should also define batch \\nacceptance testing or statistical proc ess controls that ensure material \\nproperties do not drift over time. Material requirements identified in the feedstock specification are derived fro m process validation activities used \\nto identify the key process variables that strongly correlate with the attributes required in the final AM parts. \\n15 \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n8.1.2 Reuse of Feedstock Material. \\n8.1.2.1 If reuse or recycling of powder – including closed loop powder flow \\nprocesses – is allowed, the applican t should show that reused powder \\ncontinues to conform to the requi rements of the feedstock material \\nspecification. \\n8.1.2.2 If blending of reused and virgin powder is allowed, the applicant should \\nshow how blending of reused powder is accomplished. Regardless of \\nwhether 100 percent reused powder or a blend of virgin and reused \\npowder is used – including close loop powder flow processes – the \\napplicant should define any limitati ons on powder reuse (e.g., number of \\nbuild cycles, number of build hours,  hours in the machine, and powder \\noxygen level). Finally, the applicant should show that final part properties, including material properties, c ontinue to conform to all design \\nrequirements at the limit of reuse (see paragraph 6 in this AC). Reuse of powder should be controlled by the specification. \\n8.1.3 Process Validation. \\nProcess validation \\nis used to ensure that ke y process variables which strongly correlate \\nwith the attributes required in the final AM parts, such as mechanical, physical, \\nmetallurgical, or chemical properties, are ap propriately defined and frozen such that \\nprocess requalification is re quired if one or more of these key process variables is \\nchanged. Before freezing these key process va riables, parametric studies (i.e., process \\nvalidation\\n) should be completed to define th eir critical tolerance va lues in the process \\nspecifications. Process specifications should address: \\n•Shop and equipment operating procedures. \\n•Power level verification. \\n•Software control. \\n•Build interruptions and machine restarts. \\n•Environmental controls. \\n•Contamination control plan. \\n•Powder handling and reuse requirements. \\n•Quality assurance requirements. \\n16 \\n6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n8.1.4 Part Material Specifications and Engineering Drawings. \\nPart material specifications and engin eering drawings establish the acceptance \\nrequirem\\nents for parts fabricated by PBF AM. These documents include any required \\npost-AM processing operations and should ensu re that variation in strength and other \\nproperties meet design properties consistent w ith the design intent. Material anomalies, \\nsuch as porosity and inclusions that are permitted by the material specifications, should \\nbe substantiated by test evidence at the speci men or part level. These specifications \\nshould include a process for confirming that  material properties continue to meet \\nassumptions reflected in the design data via peri odic specimen or part level testing. Part \\nmaterial specifications, when combined with engineering drawings, should address \\nchemistry, mechanical properties, microstructure, porosity, surface finish, thermal processing, and quality assurance. These doc uments should also address any required \\npost-AM processing operations. Additionally, the part material specifications should address certification of conformance to th e material specification for the feedstock \\nmaterial including such featur es as input powder chemistry, number of powder re-uses, \\nprocess specifications, and attri butes that link the AM part ba ck to the material used to \\ndevelop the design curves associated with the material specification. \\n9 POST BUILD PROCESSING. \\n9.1 Post Build Operations. \\nAfter compl\\netion of the build cycle, AM pa rts will be subjected to one or more post \\nbuild operations. The sequence and specifics of these operations may affect the final \\npart microstructure, material characteristic s, residual stress, and dimensional control. \\nPost build operations, including the se quence of these operations, should be \\ndocumented in a control plan. Examples of  post build operations include removing AM \\nparts from the build platform, removing support structure, removing residual powder \\nfrom the AM parts, \\nsubjecting AM parts to one or more thermal cycles, and use of \\nsurface enhancement treatments to address surface condition. \\n9.2 Residual Powder Removal. \\nIf applicable, residual powder should be removed from\\n AM parts. Steps should also be \\nincluded to confirm that all residual powder has been removed when required. \\n9.3 Residual Stress. \\nThe mu\\nltiple localized melting and re-solidification cycles associated with AM \\nprocesses can result in significant residual stress being developed in AM parts. As a \\nresult, part distortion can o ccur during the application of post build thermal processes \\nand engine operation. The me\\nthod(s) for addressing residual stress in AM parts \\nassociated with the build process should be accounted for in the design process. \\n9.4 Removal from the Build Platform. \\nThe me\\nthod for removing parts from the build platform should be defined. The \\nsequence in which parts will be remove d may also need to be defined. \\n17 \\n \\n \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n9.5 Removal of Support Structures. \\nThe me\\nthod(s) for removing support structures from the AM part should be defined in \\nthe part m aterial specification or on the e ngineering drawing if removal is required. The \\nsequence in which support structures will be  removed may also need to be defined. \\n9.6 Thermal Processing. \\nIt is \\nexpected that AM parts will require ther mal processing operations to evolve the as-\\nbuilt microstructure into a final form, yielding proper and predictable material \\nperformance. If thermal cycles are used to improve material microstructure, such as to reduce anisotropy and/or improve homoge neity, each thermal cycle should be \\nsufficiently controlled to ensure repeat able and reliable results. Any specific \\nrequirements for final microstructure attri butes, such as an acceptable level of \\nanisotropy and the m\\nethod used for confirmi ng acceptable microstructure attributes, \\nshould be defined in the part material sp ecification or on the engineering drawing. \\n9.7 Hot Isostatic Pressing (HIP). \\nIf AM parts are subjected to HIP, the pro cess param\\neters for this operation should be \\ndefined. Any specific \\nrequirements for final microstructure attributes and the method \\nused for confirming acceptable microstructure attributes should also be defined. \\n9.8 Surface Enhancements. \\nTo address surface rough\\nness associated with “as produced” AM parts surface \\nenhancem\\nent treatments may be applied. The type of surface enhancement(s) applied to \\nparts should be defined in the part material specification or on the engineering drawing. \\n9.9 Environmentally Protective Coatings. \\nEnvironm\\nentally protective coatings may be applied to AM parts. The type of \\nprotective coating applied to the parts shoul d be defined, and the potential effect on \\nsubstrate m\\naterial properties should be understood. \\n10 INSPECTI\\nON METHODS. \\n10.1 Inspection Method Considerations. \\nWhile AM parts m\\nay present unique inspect ion challenges compared to cast and \\nwrought products, from an NDI perspective they are finished parts that should be \\ninspected. The NDI development and verification processes used  for cast and wrought \\nproducts can be applied to the parts produ ced by these new manufacturing processes. \\nAdditionally, radiographic re quirem\\nents specified in i ndustry standard welding \\nspecifications may also be used. \\n18 \\n \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n10.2 Relationship to the NDI Development for Cast and Wrought Products. \\nThe physics of the layered AM process produces  different typ\\nes of material anomalies \\nthan those produced in traditional cast and wrought products. The layer-by-layer \\ndeposition approach used in the AM pr ocesses may produce anomalies that do not \\npossess significant height in the build direc tion. Planar anomalies, such as lack of \\nfusion, tend to form along the build plane a nd can be only one to two layers thick. In \\naddition, as-built surfaces that are not well s upported during the build process can be \\nrough and mask the presence of surface anoma lies. While all the inspection processes \\ntypically used for cast and wrought products, such as radiography, dye penetrant, eddy \\ncurrent (EC), or ultrasonic testing (U\\nT) are ap plicable to AM parts, they may need to be \\napplied in new or combined ways to de tect anomalies produced by AM processes. \\n10.3 Role of Inspection in AM Part Quality. \\nNDI should not be viewed in isolation when developing a plan to ensure the integrity of \\nAM parts. N\\nDI should be viewed as one op tion to ensure part integrity along with \\nprocess validation, process monitoring, proof testing, periodic de structive evaluation, \\nand other establish\\ned quality control methods . Inspection should be integrated with \\nthese other methods in a complementary way to ensure part quality. \\n10.4 Identification of NDI Criteria. \\nAs with any trad\\nitional part, the first step in developing an inspection technique is to \\nunderstand the inspection requirements for the part. As part of the materials \\ncharacterization process outlined in paragraph 6, material anomalies intrinsic to the \\nselected AM processing parameters, mate rial system, and part design should be \\nidentified. Examples of possible material a nomalies include porosity, lack of fusion, \\nexcessive surface roughness, and inclusions. In addition to the type of anomalies produced by the AM process, the maximum size of those anomalies that the design can \\nallow should be specified. Identification of areas with different acceptance criterion (for \\nexample, proximity of allowable defects) is acceptable similar to how castings are \\ntreated, provided the applicant can demonstrate that such an approach is consistent with \\nengineering and design requi rem\\nents. NDI experts can select and validate the \\nappropriate NDI technique(s) with this information. \\n10.5 Placement of NDI within the Manufacturing Process. \\nUsing the inspection criteria described in paragraph 10.4, it is im\\nportant to locate the \\ninspection correctly within the sequence of operations for the part. For example, if a \\npart goes through a HIP operation to eliminate porosity, it may not be appropriate to inspect for porosity before the HIP operation. Inspection prior to HIP is acceptable but may produce unallowable indications that wi ll be healed in a subsequent operation. \\nSim\\nilarly, if machining damage may occur, the inspection for that  damage should occur \\nafter all machining operations are complete. \\n19 \\n6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n10.6 Selection of NDI Techniques. \\nOnce the type of anom\\nalies, allowable sizes for those anomalies, and the placement of \\nNDI within the manufacturing process sequ ence are established, NDI techniques can be \\nevaluated and selected. To evaluate NDI t echniques, components with examples of the \\nanomalies, or artificial features that are considered representative of the anomalies, \\nneed to be manufactured. Due to the nature  of the AM process, parameters used to \\nproduce these components should be as clos ely aligned to the final manufacturing \\nprocess param\\neters as possible. Regardless of the NDI process(s) selected, acceptance \\ncriteria should be established and verified. \\n10.6.1 Radiographic Testing (RT) a nd Computed Tom\\nography (CT). \\nRT and CT process capabilities are dependent  on part geom\\netry. One of the advantages \\nof AM processes is rapid design iteration by eliminating the need to create dies or \\ntooling. If CT capability is determ\\nined too early in the design process, changes in part \\ngeometry by the final desi gn iteration may change cap ability in critical areas. \\n10.6.2 Ultrasonic T\\nesting (UT) and Penetrant Testing (PT). \\nThe capability of UT and PT are influenced by surface condition. The su\\nrface condition \\nof AM parts can change sign ificantly based on bu ild parameters and support structure \\nplacem\\nent. Inspection capability should be assessed on samples representative of the \\nfinal manufacturing process. \\n10.7 Inspection \\nof Rough Surfaces. \\n10.7.1 As discussed in paragraph 7.4, the as-built surface condition of AM parts differs from \\nthose produced by traditional manufacturing methods. The surfaces, in general, are \\nrougher than those produced by casting or wrought processes an d have more variation. \\nThe condition of the as-built surfaces requiri ng inspection should be considered when \\nselecting the NDI method(s) to be used to  evaluate parts. An impact study should be \\nconducted on specimens that are representative of the final as-built surfaces for the component to ensure adequate capabi lity to detect conditions of concern. \\n10.7.2 For surfaces where NDI capability is re duced due to surface roughness, additional \\nmanufacturing steps should be consider ed to improve surface conditions. Surface \\nfinishing processes, typically used with cast and wrought products, may be used to \\nimprove the inspectability of surfaces. Improvi ng surface finish is preferred to selecting \\nan NDI method whose capability is not im pacted by surface roughness but is not as \\ncapable of finding the specified anomaly types. \\n10.8 \\nInspection of Complex Geometries. \\nAM process can produce part geom\\netries th at are not possible using traditional \\nmanufacturing methods. While these new geomet ries provide great benefits for cost and \\nperformance, they can create challenges fo r traditional NDI approaches. New complex \\ngeometries will require new inspection approaches, including the combination of \\nmultiple ND\\nI methods and new or emerging NDI methods, such as laser ultrasonic \\ntesting (LUT) or CT. \\n20 \\n6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n10.9 Inspection of Internal Features. \\nAM parts often have internal features that need to\\n be inspected, but access to these \\nsurfaces is pa\\nrtially or completely obstruct ed. As a result, traditional dimensional and \\nNDI methods may not be sufficient. \\n10.9.1 CT Inspection Systems. \\nCT is one inspection me\\nthod currently approve d for the inspection of internal features \\nthat c\\nannot be directly accessed. Currently, there are four different categories of CT \\ninspection systems: \\n•Nanofocus (140-200 KeV).\\n•Microfocus (200-450 KeV).\\n•Mini-focus (300-600 KeV).\\nIndustrial (1000-9000 KeV).\\nThe type of CT system to use depends on the size and density of the part to inspect, the \\nsize of the feature(s) to be measured, an d anoma\\nlies to detect. In general, higher-\\npowered systems have more penetrating pow er for large or dense parts but produce \\nimages with lower resolution. \\nNote: Kiloelectron volt (KeV) is the power of the x-ray system measured in 1000s (K) \\nof electron volts (eV). \\n11 PROCESS QUALIFICATION. \\n11.1 Process Qualification Considerations. \\nThe funda\\nmental goal of fusion process contro l is to consistently achieve consolidation \\nof the feedstock material to the greatest exte nt possible without the presence of fusion-\\nrelated defects. The process parameters specifi ed to control the fusion process are set to \\nachieve the desired material density, geometric detail, microstructure, surface \\ncondition, and other fusion-related characteri stics in the as-built structure. The AM \\nprocess should be properly controlled to produce stable and repr oducible dim\\nensions, \\nproperties, and quality. \\n11.2 Process Validation. \\nProcess validation is the m\\nethodology used to  verify that a component manufactured to \\na specific process, process sequence, and dr awing requirements meet s the design intent. \\nProcess validation requirements include, but ar e not limited to, first article inspections, \\ndestructive evaluation of parts, NDI eval uations, metallurgical examinations, and \\nchemistry and mechanical property testing. Process validation should also address \\npotential feedstock variability, machine va riability, and post pr ocessing variability. \\nAssessm\\nent of machine variability should incl ude variability within the build volume, \\nrun-to-run variability, and va riability between machines. \\n21 •\\n \\n  \\n 6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n11.3 Qualifying a Fixed Process. \\nProcess va\\nlidation is necessary to assure that all physical, chemical, and metallurgical \\nmaterial characteristics are satisfied, and to ensure that manufacturing anomalies are \\nnot introduced by the process. Process characte ristics that have a direct influence on the \\nfinal AM part mechanical properties and physical attributes are identified as key \\nprocess variables that should be defined a nd carefully controlled  in a specification \\nand/or technical plan. Review and approval of the overall process specification and \\nquality control plan should involve engin eering, manufacturing, a nd quality functions. \\nThe process specifica\\ntion and/or technical plan  should require process requalification if \\none or more of the key pr ocess variables is changed. \\n11.4 Machine Qualification. \\nQualificatio\\nn runs should be accomplishe d in accordance with the approved \\nspecif\\nication and/or technical pl an to verify that the fabric ated parts have the material \\nproperties assumed in the design data for the part. \\n11.4.1 Part and Specim\\nen Evaluation. \\nBoth destructive and non-destr uctive evaluation of parts and specim\\nens can be used to \\nsupport initial and ongoing process validation. Destructive evaluation is necessary for validation of certain engineering or quality characteristics, such as physical, chemical, and metallurgical aspects that are not insp ectable by conventional NDI techniques. The \\nselected combination of destructive a nd non-destructive evaluation of parts and \\nspecimens should demonstrate that all engin eering requirements are achieved with the \\ndefined process parameters. Evaluation part s and specimens should be produced with \\nfeedstock material reflecting the approved f eedstock material specification criteria \\nincluding reused powder, if applicable, a nd be representative of the variability \\nintroduced by the m\\nanufacturing process used  to fabricate pro duction parts. Parts \\nselected for evaluation should also be representative of all build positions. \\n11.4.2 Part and Specim\\nen Evaluation Plan. \\nThe part and specim\\nen evaluation plan should address ongoing process validation \\nthrough a combination of destructive and non-destructive evaluation of parts and specimens. A periodic destructive evaluation sampling plan should be established that \\nensures confirmation that engineering require ments continue to be achieved with the \\ndefined process parameters. The sampling frequency and number of parts and specimens sampled should be established based on demonstrated statistical process control and should – over time – address all build positions. Periodic mechanical \\nproperty validation through testi ng of parts or directly prod uced specimens should also \\nbe incorporated into the process validation plan. \\n22 \\n6/23/23 AC 33.15-3 \\n11.4.3 Inspection Data. \\nNDI plus destructive evaluation of parts fr om process validation demonstration builds \\nshould be perform\\ned consistent with the in spection method considerations provided in \\nparagraph 10. This evaluation should demons trate that any anomalies present in parts \\nare acceptable to design requirements. NDI tests for process validation demonstration \\nshould be performed at the sam\\ne point in the overall part manufacturing sequence as \\ndefined in the process specifi cation and/or technical plan. \\n11.4.4 Specime\\nn Testing. \\nSpecimen testing from\\n process validation de monstration builds should be performed \\nconsistent with the test program approach described in paragraph 6. This testing should \\nconfirm that m\\naterial properties in the fabricated parts match the material properties \\nassumed in the part design data incl uding required post build processes. \\n11.4.5 Traceability. \\nDue to the batch nature of AM processes, de velopment of\\n a system for part traceability \\nis highly recommended. Retention of records such as powder heat, lot and condition \\n(for example, virgin or recy cle count), machine serial num\\nber, build number, and part \\nlocation in the build chamber are recommended for each part produced. \\n11.5 Qualificat\\nion of Multiple AM Machines. \\nWhen multiple AM machines will be used to produce parts using identical parameters, \\na separate process validation should be executed for each machine. \\n11.6 Changes to Key Process Variables. \\nChanges to key process variables should not be introduced to the fixed process unless \\nadditional qualification, includ ing testing of differences, is completed. All changes to \\nkey process variables should be validated  for each machine on which th\\ney are \\nintroduced. \\n12 SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THIS AC. \\nIf you have suggestions for improving this AC, you ma\\ny use the Advisory Circular \\nFeedback Form  at the end of this AC. \\nDigitally signed by VICTOR W \\nWICKLUND Date: 2023.06.23 16:43:07 -04\\'00\\' \\nVictor Wicklund \\nActing Director, Policy & Standards Division \\nAircraft Certification Service \\n23 \\n \\n                 \\n                      \\n  \\nOMB Control Number: 2120-0 746 \\nExpiration Date: 11/30/2024  \\nAdvisory  Circular Feedback Form  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n Paperwork Reduction Act Burden Statement: A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not \\nrequired to respond to, nor shall a person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information \\nsubject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection of information displays a currently valid \\nOMB Control Number.

In 1965, we replaced the airworthiness standards of 14 CFR part 13 for the turbine \\nengine calibration test, endurance test, and teardown inspection with those in part 33.  \\nSubsequently, w e revised those requirements numerous times over the past four decades.  The \\nmost significant revisions were in amendments 6 and 10, adopted in 1974 and 1977, respectively.  \\nThese amendments upgraded the engine endurance test and t eardown inspection requirements to \\naccommodate the increasing complexity of modern turbine engines, and the interface between \\nengines and airframes.   See appendix 12 of this AC for a historical background of the changes to \\nthe airworthiness standards for the engine calibration test, endurance test, and teardown inspection. \\nb. In the past, several engine manufacturers have proposed engine testing that is more \\nrepresentative of expected in -service operations in place of the endurance cycle defined in \\nii \\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-IA \\n§ 33.87. We accepted some of those proposals; however, we detennined that those alternate \\napproaches don\\' t provide an equivalent level of testing. We no longer accept these previously \\napproved methods ofcompliance to§ 33.87. Those previously acceptable alternatives aren\\' t \\nacceptable because the test in§ 33.87 does not simulate in-service operation. Rather, \\ncompliance to § 33.87 is to demonstrate an accelerated durability test of the engine; to \\ndemonstrate a minimum level ofengine operability and durability throughout the engine\\'s \\nassigned ratings and operating limitations. \\nc. Engine endurance testing is covered by several regulations , not just§ 33.87. The test \\nrequirement s are specified in § 33.82, the calibration tests in§ 33.85, the teardown inspection in \\n§ 33.93, and the block tests in § 33.99. For engine components and systems that cannot be \\nadequately verified by endurance testing in accordance with the provisions of§ 33.87, the \\napplicant must conduct the testing required by§ 33.91 to establish that these components are \\nable to function reliably in all certificated operating conditions. \\nd. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 of this AC correspond to the requirements in§§ 33.85, 33.87, and \\n33.93, respectively. We arranged the contents of each chapter of this AC in accordance with the \\norder ofthe paragraphs in the regulation. The general testing requirements contained in§§ 33.82 \\nand 33.99 are included in these chapters w herever applicable. The appendices define \\ndocumentation requirement s for the calibration, endurance tests, teardown inspection , define \\ntesting requirements for special applications , and provide background information for the \\nguidance material. \\ne. The guidance in this AC is derived from extensive FAA and industry experience in \\ndetermining the basis of compliance to§§ 33.85, 33.87, and 33.93. if, however, we determine \\nthat testing perfonned in accordance with the guidance in this AC would still not result in \\ncomplete compliance with these regulation s, we may require additional supporting data. \\nIf you have any suggestio ns for improvements or changes, you may use the template provided at \\nthe end of this AC. \\nC/JJUt YJ1 v!lLU4MtcLJ \\nfr) ( Ann C.

G eneral \\n1-1. Definitions .  The following definitions apply to the terms used in this AC . \\na. Engine component . Systems and accessories that are part of the engine type design. \\nb. Endurance test cycle. The series of runs or sequences prescribed in each §§ 33.87(b) \\nthrough (g). \\nc. Germane or p rimary hardware . The hardware used in the certification test that is \\naffected by, or directly affects the outcome of the certification test and the pass or fail criteria for \\nthe given test objectives. \\nd. Redline conditions . The highest physical rotor speed, gas temperature, or output shaft \\ntorque, including transients, which may not be exceeded during operation at any applicable rating.  The type certificate data sheet (TCDS) prescribes the limitations for each approved engin e rating . \\ne. Test hardware . The parts and components assembled on the engine and to be tested, or, \\nif not mounted on the engine, are part of the engine type design.  The test hardware may deviate \\nfrom the type design if it remains representative of the type design and the applicant justifies the differences in the test plan.  This justification is frequently referred to as “reconciliation.” \\nf. Triple redline test condition . The engine operation at simultaneous redline rotor speeds, \\nredline gas temperature, an d full rated thrust or torque, as required by § 33.87(a)(3).  For \\nexample, for a two -shaft system engine, t he engine operation at simultaneous redline s of the two \\nrotor speeds (e.g. low pressure and high pressure rotor systems) and redline gas temperature, in addition to full rated thrust or torque. \\n1 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nChapter  2.  Calibration T ests \\n2-1. Power Characteristics . \\na. The power characteristics should be established based on the endurance test of the \\nengine that represent s the type design and is in the following configuration: \\n(1) No air bleed for aircraft services , and \\n(2) With o nly those accessories installed that are essential for engine functioning, \\nexcept when the TCDS defines other conditions that are used to determine the engine ratings. \\nb. The test data is then referenced to the standard atmosphere conditions for which the \\nengine rating is defined. \\n2-2. General Requirements in §§ 33.85(a), 33.85(b), and 33.85(c). \\na. The pre- and post-endurance calibration tests required by § 33.85, establish the engine ’s \\npower characteristics in the type design configuration over its entire operating range of speeds, \\npressures, and temperatures .  The se tests provide the means for measur ing the engine \\ndeterioration caused by the endurance test. \\nb. To identify the changes in engine power characteristics that may occur during the engine \\nendurance test of § 33.87, applicants must compare the engine’s power characteristics \\nestablished before and after the endurance test, except as provided by § 33.85(d) for the 30\\xad\\nsecond and 2- minute OEI ratings .  This exception is further discussed in paragraph 2-3 of this \\nAC. \\nc. Applicants should run the calibration tests with a clean inlet and exhaust, and without \\nspecial test equipment , such as inlet screen, pre- swirler , mixer screen, or non -type design exhaust \\nnozzles.  In addition, the facility hardware must be similar to a production test cell (e.g., engine \\ncowling, bell mouth, and normal engine control schedules).  W hen special test equipment is \\nnecessary to obtain simultaneous redline conditions during the endurance test , applicant s must \\naddress the engine configuration changes .  See paragraph 3-1.c. and appendix 4 of this AC for \\nfurther guidance. The power settings should include the highest power or thrust rating c apability \\nof the engine during the initial and final power calibrations.  See paragraphs 3- 4.a.(2)(a) and \\n(2)(b) of this AC for power or thrust setting adjustments and permitted power or thrust shortfalls. \\nd. The calibration test data should show that following completion of the endurance test , \\nthe engine is capable of producing its rated  power or thrust without exceeding any speed, gas \\ntemperature, or operating limit(s) specified in the TCDS. \\ne. The applicant  should record the calibration test measurements only after the engine \\noperating condition stabilizes at each rating condition.  The only exception is the recording of data at the 30-second and 2-minute OEI rating conditions described in § 33.85(d), during which the gas temperature need not be stabilized at the end of the rating time limit. \\n2 \\n\\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n2-3. Provisions for 30- second and 2 -minute OEI Ratings, § 33.85(d).  The extended engine \\noperation at the 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings during calibration testing could \\nincrease hardware deterioration beyond what the endurance test would demonstrate for the \\nratings alone.  Therefore, the data recorded during the OEI power segments in § 33.87(f) may be \\nused toward compliance with the calibration test requirements of these two ratings.  However, \\nthe applicant should record this data during the first and last test cycle to properly represent the \\npretest and post- test performance capability of the engine.  The following paragraphs in this \\nsection provide guidance on how the data from § 33.87 may be used to support compliance with § 33.85. \\na. The applicant should determine the engine’s power characteristics at the 30 -second and \\n2-minute OEI rating conditions.  These power characteristics  should include deterioration \\ndetermined from the pretest calibration prior to the endurance test of § 33.87(f), up to and \\nincluding the third test sequence of the 30-second rated  power.  The power deterioration through \\nthe third test sequence should be the best indicator of the worst- case power deterioration that \\ncould occur during actual usage at the rating.  This data must be included in the i nstallation \\nmanual to define performance characteristics of the engine. \\nb. If power deterioration exceeds 10 percent at the 30-second rating over the course of the \\n2-hour test in § 33.87(f), and even if the engine still produces rated  power at the end of the test, \\nthe applicant should evaluate the mode of deterioration to ensure that the availability of 30\\xad\\nsecond rated power in service will not be compromised by deterioration variability. \\nc. In addition to the calibration data from § 33.85(d), any available information from tests \\nin §§ 33.88 and 33.90 should also be used to establish the engine characteristics throughout the \\nengine operating envelope. \\n3 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n        \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n     \\n \\n         \\n      \\n  \\n       \\n     \\n       \\n \\n     \\n \\n       \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n       \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nChapter  3.  E ndurance  Test \\n3-1. General Requirements in § 33.87(a). \\na. The endurance t est. The endurance test is not a simulation of expected in- service \\noperation, but an accelerated severity test intended to demonstrate a minimum level of engine operability and durability within the approved engine ratings and operating limitations. \\n(1) The test requirements of §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), (e), or (g) are to demonstrate that at \\nthe end of the test, the engine con forms to its type design  and is safe for continued operation.  \\nThe requirement for § 33.87(f) is to demonstrate that at the end of the supplemental test , at a \\nminimum,  the structural integrity of the engine is maintained .  This determination should be \\nbased on the inspection and maintenance requirements that are defined in the instructions for continued airworthiness ( ICA) that will be submitted in compliance with § 33.4.  To demonstrate \\nthis minimum level of durability and operability, the engine should: \\n(a) Continue to produce its rated power or thrust at the end of the test in \\n§§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), (e), or (g) without exceeding any of the operating limitations defined by \\ncompliance with §§ 33.4, 33.5, and 33.7 and prescribed in the TCDS. \\n(b) Demonstrate acceptable operability from minimum to rated takeoff power or \\nthrust without overtemperature, surge, stall, or other detrimental occurrences. \\n(c) Demonstrate durability while operating up to rated thrust, power, or torque; \\nredline and transient rotor speeds and gas temperature s; and when applying maximum rated \\nloads on accessory drives and mounting attachments. \\n(d) Demonstrate the maximum compressor bleed air capability for engine and \\naircraft use.   Paragraph 3 -2.e. of this AC provides g uidance for maximum compressor bleed air . \\n(e) Demonstrate acceptable operation at minimum and maximum fuel and \\nhydraulic fluid pressure limit conditions.  Advisory Circular 33.7-1 provides information and guidance on the fuel pressure limit  locations. \\n(f) Demonstrate acceptable operation at the minimum and maximum lubrication \\noil pressure and temperature limit conditions. \\n(g) Demonstrate starting capability and drainage or expulsion of unwanted fluids \\nor fuel that may accumulate after a false start. \\n(2) The test engine may also be used for other part 33 engine tests in conjunction with \\nthe endurance test runs.  In addition, the data and results from the endur ance test may also be \\nused to show compliance to other part 33 regulations.  These regulations may include: \\n(a) Engine ratings and operating limitations in § 33.7. \\n4 \\n\\n   \\n      \\n \\n     \\n      \\n      \\n                 \\n           \\n      \\n           \\n       \\n              \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(b) Engine power and thrust settings in § 33.8(b). \\n(c) Suitability and durabilit y of materials in § 33.15. \\n(d) Fluid drainage demonstration in § 33.17(f ). \\n(e) Durability in § 33.19(a). \\n(f) Accessory attachments in § 33.25. \\n(g) Surge and stall characteristics in § 33.65. \\n(h) Bleed air systems in § 33.66 and bleed and power extraction in § 33.89. \\n(i) Ignition system function in § 33.69. \\n(j) Fuel system in §  33.67(a) and (b). \\n(k) Lubrication system, § 33.71(a) and (b). \\n(l) Hydraulic actuating systems, § 33.72. \\n(m) Power or thrust response, § 33.73, and acceleration time in §  33.89(a). \\n(n) Engine-propeller system tests for turbopropeller engines in § 33.95. \\n(o) Thrust reverser test in § 33.97. \\n(p) Fuel venting emissions in Subpart B of 14 CFR part 34. \\n(3) The general endurance test requirements specified in § 33.82, the calibration test in \\n§ 33.85, the endurance test in § 33.87, the teardown inspection in § 33.93, and the general conduct of block test requirements specified in § 33.99 form integral parts of the engine’s \\nendurance testi ng.  However, some systems or components may not be adequately substantiated \\nby endurance testing alone under the requirements of § 33.87.  For these systems or components, applicants should complete additional component level tests under the requirements defined in \\n§ 33.91 to establish that the systems, or components , can function reliably in all engine operating \\nand atmospheric conditions that will be certificated.   For example, to properly demonstrate its \\noperability and durability characteristics, the main accessory gearbox must be tested at the maximum rated pad loads and power extraction loads that will be certified. If these extreme gearbox load conditions exceed the capability of the applicant’s endurance testing facilities, then the applicant may choose to complete an additional gearbox rig test at these maximum rating conditions. \\n(4) The endurance test must include at least 150 hours of testing in accordanc e with the \\nseries of test schedules specified in §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), (e), and (g), depending upon the type \\n5 \\n\\n   \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n           \\n     \\n      \\n \\n     \\n     \\n        \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n    \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nand contemplated use of the engine.  The applicant must conduct the prescribed 6 -hour \\nendurance test cycle 25 times to complete the required 150 hours of operation, unless we approve \\na different test sequence.  For engines seeking the 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings, the \\napplicant must conduct an additional 2-hour test in accordance with the test schedule in § 33.87(f), for a total test time of at least 152 hours.  Appendix 1 of this AC presents the \\ngraphical profiles of the endurance test schedules specified in §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), (e), and (f). \\n(5) The limits of rotor speed, power or thrust, output torque, and gas temperature that \\nare included in the engine TCDS, as required by § 33.7, must be less than or equal to those \\nvalues that were demonstrated during the endurance test for each engine rating condition. \\nb. Endurance test plan requirements . \\n(1) Applicants should prepare a test plan for the endurance test defining the manner in \\nwhich the test will be conducted.  Applicants should submit this test plan early enough to allow us the time to review and approve the plan prior to the start of the test.  At a minimum, th e plan \\nshould contain: \\n(a) T he applicable part 33 section(s) , \\n(b) A description of the germane or primary hardware to be tested and certified , \\n(c) A description of properly calibrated test equipment necessary to conduct the \\ntest, \\n(d) Confor mity requirements of the test item(s) and test setup , \\n(e) The test procedure with sufficient detail to fully describe the method of \\ncompliance, and \\n(f) The pass/fail criteria. \\n(2) See appendix 2 of this AC for additional information about test plan requirements. \\nc. Test engine configuration . \\n(1) The test engine configuration  must substantially conform to the final type design.  \\nThis means that all engine hardware, software, and systems to be certified should have, at most, only minor deviations from the type design.  The applicant should disclose, in the test plan , any \\ndeviations (referred to as “nonconformances”) of the hardware, software, and components from the type design .  The applicant  should provide acceptable evidence that these non- type design \\nparts are representative of the capabilities, durability, and operating characteristics of the type design parts, and they will not adversely affect the outcome or the integrity of the test.  Further, the non- type design part should not adversely affect the functioning of any other part or system.  \\nJustification of nonconformance acceptability is frequently referred to as reconciliation. \\n6 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n     \\n       \\n      \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nApplicants should submit all such non-type design configuration deviations and associated reconciliations to us for approval. \\n(a) The standard type design configuration and operating characteristics of some \\nturbine engines may preclude achieving a triple redline test for compliance with § 33.87(a)(3).  \\nModification of certain test equipment, engine configurations, and test sequences may be necessary to run the test at triple redline conditions.  The applicant should show through analysis that the test engine , with any modifications , still represents the durability and operating \\ncharacteristics of a typical type design engine, and that the engine is capable of comply ing with \\n§ 33.87 requirements. \\n(b) The applicant may run more than one test on the same set of hardware to be \\npresented for certification if all operating parameters cannot be held simultaneously at 100 percent of the values to be certificated.  See appendix 3 of this AC for additional information on \\nan acceptable endurance test cycle for multiple engine tests. \\n(2) Appendix 4 of this AC shows methods that may be us ed for matching engine \\nspeeds and temperatures for the desired test conditions. \\n(3) Appendix 5 of this AC provides guidance for the endurance test engine conformity \\ninspections. \\n(4) The applicant should provide information on aircraft components that will be \\nmounted on or driven by the engine, and that are not part of engine type design.  These components may affect the operation of the engine and thus the outcome of the endurance test.  An example of this type of information is the weight, overhung moment, or power extraction loads imposed on the engine by each accessory.  The applicant may install the component or simulating loading device on the test engine when approved by us. \\n(5) Some engine components, such as large integrated starter generators , may require \\nhigh levels of horsepower extraction from the engine core rotor through the gearbox.  High levels of power ext raction from the engine core could stall the engine at flight idle or below, or during \\ntransient operations.  To determine the level of horsepower extraction appropriate for the various segments of the endurance test, the applicant should consider: \\n(a) The effects of high levels of horsepower extraction on engine stability, \\noperating characteristics, and durability of the power extraction hardware, and \\n(b) The effects of electrical load transients at critical engine operating conditions , \\nincluding idle. \\nd. Engine component and test equipment calibrations . \\n(1) Before and after the endurance test, the applicant should establish and record the \\nadjustment setting and functioning characteristic of each engine component that can be adjusted \\nindependently of installation on the engine, as required by §§ 33.82 and 33.93(a)(1), \\n7 \\n\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n        \\n      \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nrespectively. These components may include, but are not limited to, the control system, pumps, \\nactuators, heat exchangers, and valves.  During the endurance test, all components should operate in a manner consistent with both the type design and the engine operating instructions. \\n(2) The fuel, lubricating oil, and hydraulic fluid used for the endurance test must \\nconform to the specifications prescribed in the TCDS and ICA.  The applicant should provide a \\nstatement in the test report identifying the specifications of all engine fluids used during the test. Verification of fluid properties is the responsibility of the applicant, not the fluid suppliers. \\n(3) Prior to starting the endurance test, applicants should calibrate: \\n(a) All test equipment and measuring instrumentation necessary to operate and \\nmonitor the engine and the test facility to FAA -approved standards, \\n(b) All engine components according to their component calibration schedules. \\n(4) Applicants should maintain instrumentation calibration and measurement system \\naccuracy  throughout the duration of the test.  This may be accomplished by verifying the post-\\ntest calibrations or using recognized and documented applicant procedures available to the FAA \\nif requested. \\ne. Engine vibration signature . Applicants should establish the engine vibration signature \\nduring both pre-endurance and post- endurance tests by record ing the  vibration amplitudes as a \\nfunction of engine rotor speed.  Engine accelerometers mounted on the engine cases may be used \\nto record the vibration data.  Changes to the engine’s vibration signature over its operating range \\ndue to any part deterioration caus ed by the endurance test can be conveniently measured by \\ncomparing vibration surveys conducted before and after the test.  Applicants should conduct these vibration surveys by applying slow accelerations and decelerations of not less than 2\\xad\\nminute durations that cover the range from minimum to maximum permissible rotor speeds, including any transient operations.  Post- endurance test vibration signatures should not show a \\nsignificant change from the data recorded during the pre -endurance vibration survey, and should \\nstill be at or below the allowable limits established for compliance with part 33 requirements.  \\nThe only purpose of the surveys conducted during endurance testing is to determine potential \\nvibration signature changes due to engine deterioration.  Applicants should address significant changes in vibrations to determine their causes and, if necessary, make applicable design changes; the test report should document all findings and actions taken. \\nf. Servicing and repairs during the endurance test . \\n(1) Applicants should monitor oil consumption during the test and ensure it remains \\nwithin the allowable limits prescribed in the engine operating documents. If the oil consumption \\nexceeds the allowable limits, the applicant should determine the cause and take corrective action \\nduring the test, or otherwise revis e the engine manuals  to reflect the consumption observed \\nduring the test.  We also recommend that applicants periodically check oil samples for the presence of metalli c particles or other debris that may indicate an impending failure of one or \\nmore parts. \\n8 \\n\\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n       \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n        \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n     \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(2) During the endurance tests, only servicing and minor repairs may be permitted by \\nthe ICA service and maintenance instructions , refer to § 33.99(b).  Repairs tha t are normally \\nrequired to aid in the engine reassembly after overhaul, such as drive shaft or stub shaft mating surface plating for assembly may be considered minor repairs. \\n(3) Section 33.99(b) requires that the applicant must subject the engine or its parts to \\nadditional test(s) or penalty test run(s) that we find necessary i f during the endurance test , the \\nfrequency of service or the number of stops due to engine malfunction is excessive; or if a major \\nrepair or replacement of a part is found necessa ry; or because of findings from the teardown \\ninspection. \\n(4) If an engine part fails during the test, the applicant should determine the cause of \\nfailure and assess the effect on the durability and operability of the engine.  The applicant should determine and justify any corrective actions prior to resuming the test. \\ng. Endurance test report requirements . \\n(1) The certification test report(s) should contain sufficient data (for example, plots and \\ntabulations) and discussion showing that the en gine has successfully demonstrated compliance to \\nall requirements of the calibration testing, endurance testing, and the teardown inspection regulations.  In addition to test results and data analyses, the report should contain a list of engine faults and a complete description of all hardware distress, including any corrective actions that were implemented or are planned for implementation after the test. \\n(2) The report should also provide comparative tabulations (test results as related to \\n§ 33.87 requirements) of : \\n(a) The total time spent at each sequence of the endurance test cycle and \\nassociated power condition, and \\n(b) The minimum certificated parameter values obtained during each of those test \\ncycle sequences . \\n(3) To show engine stabilization at or above the required operating parameter values, \\nsuch as the rotor speed and gas temperature to be certificated, applicants should include a trace of one typical takeoff and idling cycle segment performed without any air bleed required by \\n§ 33.87(b)(1), and another for one acceleration and deceleration segment  required by \\n§ 33.87(b)(5).  These traces are necessary to prove that a parameter may not stabilize at its 100 \\npercent value within §§ 33.87(b)(1) or §  33.87(b)(5) test segment.  Applicants should provide \\nsupporting data showing that any deviations or exceptions to the test requirements are \\nacceptable.  This requirement also applies to the corresponding test runs of §§ 33.87(c), (d), (e), (f), or (g). \\n(4) Appendix 6 of this AC provides additional information on test report requirements. \\n9 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n        \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n       \\n    \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n3-2. Specific Requirements in §§ 33.87(a)(1) through (a)(9).  Unless otherwise specified, the \\nguidance in the following paragraphs regarding § 33.87(b) requirements also applies to the corresponding test run requirements of §§ 33.87(c), (d), (e), (f), or (g). \\na. Test sequence, § 33.87(a)(1) . Applicants should follow the 6-hour endurance test cycle \\nsequence prescribed in §§ 33.87(b) through (e) and the 2 -hour test sequence in § 33.87(f) when \\napplicable.  We may allow test segments to be run out of their normal sequence when applicants have difficulty with readjusting the engine and test facility configuration to run all test segments sequentiall y, as prescribed.  Applicants intending to run the tests with sequence changes  should \\nshow that changes to the published endurance test cycle sequence (s) do not lessen the severity of \\nthe endurance test cycle.  The applicant must also show that all test cy cle requirements, including \\nthe required number of accelerations to rated power and decelerations back to idle power, were properly completed. \\nb. Automatic control of the engine, § 33.87(a)(2) . Any automatic engine control that is \\npart of the engine typ e design  must control the engine operation during the endurance test, except \\nfor operations where manual, instead of automatic control is permitted, or where manual control is otherwise specified for a particular test run.  Software used for engine control should be representative of the type design  version.  See paragraph 3-1.c of this AC for additional guidance \\nrelated to test engine configuration. \\nc. Endurance test at redline conditions, § 33.87(a)(3) . \\n(1) During the endurance test , the engine thrust or power, torque, gas temperature, and \\nrotor shaft rotational speed(s) must be maintained simultaneously at least at 100 percent of the \\nvalues associated with the particular engine operation being tested with exceptions under \\n§§ 33.87(a) (5), (a)(6), and (a)(7).  This means that applicants must run the endurance test to the \\nmaximum permissible (or redline) rotor speeds, gas temperature, and rated power, torque, or thrust values proposed for certification and prescribed in the engine TCDS. These parameters \\nshould achieve steady -state operating values with minimal fluctuations or cyclic type variations, \\nand with any minimum variations remaining at or above the 100 percent values to be certificated. \\n(2) At each rating condition during the endurance test, the test engine must maintain \\nrated power, thrust, or torque, which are the minimum physical power, thrust, or torque values meeting the definition in 14 CFR 1.1 and the requirements of §§ 33.7(a), (c) , and 33.8(b).  The \\nrated power, thrust, or torque value that is prescribed in the TCDS is normally referenced to sea level, static, standard day pressure (14.696 psia or 101.3254 kilopascals) and the rated air temperature, with no customer air bleed or horsepower extraction allowed, an ideal inlet (100 \\npercent ram pressure recovery), and engine inlet and exhaust test hardware as specified in the TCDS. See paragraphs 3 -4.a.(2)(a) and (2)(b) of this AC for power or thrust setting adjustments \\nand permitted power or thrust shortfalls. \\n(3) If the engine cannot achieve the rated minimum physical thrust or power \\nrequirement , then the applicant should present data or analysis that shows that any difference is \\ninconsequential to the durability of those engine par ts that are subject to thrust or power loads.  \\n10 \\n\\n   \\n     \\n  \\n \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n \\n  \\n       \\n      \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nWe will determin e whether the showing is adequate or whether it requires an equivalent level of \\nsafety in accordance with  § 21.21(b)(1). \\n(4) The ambient test conditions or the test engine configuration may not allow the \\nengine to reach the triple redline test condition. In this case, the applicant may conduct more \\nthan one test, if necessary, so that all of the required testing at redline conditions is completed.  \\nHowever, all endurance testing should be co nducted on a single set of engine hardware. \\n(a)  When the applicant proposes more than one endurance test, the second test \\nshould be run at the rated thrust with at least two redline conditions maintained simultaneously.  For turbopropeller and turboshaft engines, we will base the approval of torque and output shaft speed limits on those limits demonstrated simultaneously during the endurance test. \\n(b)  Appendix 3 of this AC presents an example of an acceptable two -part test. \\n(5) If a parameter limit, such as rotor speed, for a particular engine rating , such as \\nmaximum continuous, is not defined, then the applicant should run the test segments associated with that rating condition to the maximum engine redline condition, as defined in the TCDS. \\n(6) For a transient overtemperature having the time limit greater than 30 seconds and \\nless than or equal to 2 minutes, the applicant should apply the 100 percent gas temperature limit required by 33.87 (a)(3) to the value of the transient overtemperature for the duration proposed.  \\nThe applicant should apply this transient overtemperature for each test period at takeoff power or \\nthrust conditions, and for the entire time of all the 30-second periods at takeoff power or thrust, unless § 33.87(a)(7) applies.  See appendix 7 of this AC for guidance on two -minute transient \\novertemperature limit approval. \\nd. Fuel and lubricating oil for endurance test, § 33.87(a)(4) . \\n(1) The fuel, lubricating oil, and hydraulic fluid used for the endurance test must \\nconform to the fuel, lubricating oil, and hydraulic fluid requirements listed in the TCDS and \\ninstallation instructions. \\n(2) To verify that the lubrication system functions within design intent, the applicant \\nshould monitor oil consumption during the endurance test and summarize the results in the \\ncertification report.  To verify oil type and quality, the applicant should take oil samples before and after the test, and analyze these samples to evaluate any oil property changes.  The applicant should analyze the post- test sample for the presence of any metallic particles or other \\ncontamination that may indicate the deterioration of one or more engine parts.  The applicant should disclose any evidence of oil property degradation or particle contamination in the te st \\nreport.  A dditional oil sampling should be done during the test .  The additional sampling will \\nassist oil monitoring for particle contamination, which in turn will help to identify the beginning \\nof significant part deterioration.  The oil consumption ra te, the system pressure, and temperature \\noperating limits that were demonstrated during the endurance test should be consistent with any limits prescribed in the engine installation or operating instructions. \\n11 \\n\\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n     \\n \\n    \\n  \\n         \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(3) The fuel characteristics should be consi stent throughout the test and conform in all \\nrespects to the specifications prescribed in the TCDS .  Applicants should disclose and justify a ny \\nfluid property differences from these specifications, including the use of any additives.  To establish a baseli ne, the applicant should take a fuel sample from the engine fuel supply line \\nprior to the initial power or thrust calibration check.  We may require additional sampling during the endurance test if fuel is used from sources other than the one from which the initial sample was taken. \\ne. Maximum air bleed testing, § 33.87(a)(5) . \\n(1) The applicant should ensure that the maximum permissible total air bleed be \\nextracted from the engine during at least five of the 25 endurance test cycles, except for the 3 0\\xad\\nsecond and 2- minute OEI test run under 33.87(f) ( see paragraph e.(6) below ). For these five test \\nruns with the maximum air bleed , the regulation  permits the power, thrust, or rotor speeds to be \\nless than their 100 percent redline values ; however, the g as temperature must be maintained to at \\nleast the 100 percent redline value.  Any power, thrust , or rotor shaft rotational speed reduction \\nshould not exceed the reductions due to bleed extraction if the engine were in the type design configuration. \\nNote: We recommend that only five of the 25 endurance test \\ncycles  be run with maximum permissible air bleed flow to comply \\nwith the intent of § 33.87(a)(5).  Running more than five of the \\nendurance test cycles with maximum permissible air bleed flow \\nmay not al low the engine to demonstrate compliance to the intent \\nof § 33.87(a)(3) and, therefore, should be avoided. \\n(2) In the test plan, t he applicant should specify the total compressor air bleed flow rate \\nlimit and the proportional split from each compressor air bleed port on engines having multiple \\nbleed ports .  Examples of aircraft service air bleed uses are wing and cowling anti- ice, aircraft \\nenvironmental control systems ( for example, air conditioning), and engine cross-bleed starting.  \\nDuring the enduranc e test, the applicant must demonstrate the maximum allowable air bleed flow \\nrate and the individual air bleed port flow limits specified in the TCDS and in the § 33.5 manual. \\n(3) On engines with multiple air bleed ports, the air bled from each port should be \\nextracted simultaneously at rates consistent with normal engine operation and design intent.  The combined extraction should equal the total air bleed flow limit consistent with the rating \\ncondition being tested. \\n(4) During the test runs with maximum air bleed, the power or thrust or the rotor \\nspeed(s) , or both, may be less than 100 percent of the value associated with the test condition, \\nprovided the following conditions are met: \\n(a)  Any power or thrust or rotor shaft rotational speed reduction should not exceed \\nreductions that would be due to air bleed extraction if the engine were in the type design configuration. \\n12 \\n\\n   \\n     \\n     \\n \\n    \\n  \\n         \\n   \\n      \\n \\n \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n       \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(b)  The gas temperature must be maintained at least at 100 percent of the redline \\nvalue at each power rating to be certified. \\n(5) The secondary airflow system, including the amount of air bleed for internal engine \\nhardware cooling, should function as intended by the type design. \\n(6) For the test in § 33.87(f) , an exception is permitted by the regulation to reduce test \\ncomplexity and improve the flexibility necessary  to attain key parameters , such as speed, \\ntemperature, and torque. For th is test, applicants do not need to use maximum air  bleed for \\nengine and aircraft services if the y show by test, or analysis based on test, that the engine’s \\nability to meet the teardown inspection requirements under § 33.93 is not enhanced.  See paragraph 3-8.f. of this AC for guidance regarding what the analysis should include. \\nf. Accessory drive and mounting attachment load s, § 33.87(a)(6) . \\n(1) Each accessory drive and mounting attachment must be loaded throughout the tests, \\neither with the equipment listed in the applicant\\'s assembly drawing or with facility  units of a \\nsimilar type .  An exception is permitted by 33.87(a) (6)(iii) for the 30 -second and 2- minute OEI \\ntest run under § 33.87(f) (see paragraph f.(5 ) below ).  The intent of this requirement is to \\nsimulate power extractions, weights, and overhung moments of the type design hardware for all \\noperating power or thrust levels  throughout the duration of the endurance test.  However, the \\nload imposed by each accessory used for aircraft service only should be the limit load consistent with rated  power or thrust levels to be certified.  The required loads for all other powe r or thrust \\nlevels are the normal operating loads. \\n(2) The accessory drives referred to above are typically for aircraft supplied equipment, \\nsuch as starter, generator, gearbox spare drive, and engine components supplied by an airframe \\nmanufacturer.  Th e mounting attachment points, including the mounting pads for accessory \\ndrive (s) and static structures, must also be loaded.  E ngine accessories, which are part of the \\nengine type design, must be loaded for the conditions being tested. \\n(3) For any acces sory drive and mounting attachment that cannot be adequately loaded \\nor substantiated by the endurance test, the applicant should conduct additional component tests \\non a rig in accordance with §§ 33.87(a)(6) and 33.91, Component test , to establish that the \\ncomponents can function reliably in all anticipated engine operating conditions.  For example, the main accessory gearbox may require both endurance rig testing and engine endurance testing to show compliance with § 33.87. \\n(4) When a gearbox rig test is necessary, the rig test is generally run at maximum \\ndrive-pad loading, maximum power extraction loading, and at extreme operating and environmental conditions to be approved.  These extreme conditions may be outside of the engine endurance test set -up cap ability. In this example and during the engine endurance test, \\nthe gearbox drive position may have facility hardware, either actual or nonfunctioning, mounted \\nto represent its weight and overhung moment. \\n13 \\n\\n   \\n       \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n        \\n     \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n \\n        \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(5) The applicant does not need t o load the accessory drives and mounting attachments \\nwhen running the test required for the 30-second and 2-minute OEI ratings under 33.87(f).  In \\nthis case, the applicant should show that there is no effect on the durability of any accessory \\ndrive or engine component. If the accessory drives and mounting attachments are not loaded, the \\nequivalent power should be added to the required power at the output drive.  This will ensure that \\nthe power turbine rotor assembly is operated at or above the same levels it would be if the accessory drives and mounting attachments were loaded. \\ng. Redline gas temperature or oil temperature exclusion, and fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid \\ntests, §  33.87(a)(7) . \\n(1) The regulation allows for an exception from testing at the 1 00 percent oil or \\nexhaust gas temperature “where test periods are not longer than 5 minutes and do not allow stabilization .”  This exception applies if at the end of any test period of 5 minutes or less, the \\ntype design characteristics of the engine are such that either the oil or exhaust gas temperature are still increasing and have not yet achieved their limiting value. To sa tisfy the requirements of \\nthis exception, the applicant should provide supporting data showing that these are the engine’s \\nnormal engine operating characteristics. \\n(2) The term “stabilization” of this requirement means that engine operating \\nparameters , such as oil temperature or gas temperature , have achieved steady -state operating \\nvalues with minimal fluctuations or cyclic type variations and any minimum variations remain at \\nor above the 100 percent value to be certificated. \\n(3) To establish the time  duration it takes for parameter s to stabilize , the applicant \\nshould start measuring time from when the throttle is first moved from the minimum idle \\nposition toward  the takeoff power position.  Move t he throttle from the minimum idle position to \\nthe takeo ff power position within one second. \\n(4) The exception to the § 33.87(a)(7 ) requirement to maintain  the gas temperature at \\nthe 100 percent or redline value does not apply to the 5-minute or longer runs at takeoff power or thrust during the 5-minute test periods in §§ 33.87(b)(1) , (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1).  Nor does it \\napply to the 30- minute test periods in §§ 33.87(b)(2)(ii), (c)(2)(ii), (d)(2)(ii), and (e)(2).  This \\nmeans that the gas temperature must be stabilized at or above the 100 percent redl ine value \\nbefore those 5-minute and 30- minute test periods, respectively, can begin.  For most engines, the \\ngas temperature does not generally require a 5 -minute run period to stabilize at the redline value. \\n(5) For rotorcraft engines, the exception to the § 33.87(a)(7 ) requirement to maintain \\nthe gas temperature at the 100 percent or redline value to be certificated does not normally apply \\nto the test periods rated continuous OEI, rated 30-minute OEI, 2 ½-minute OEI, 2- minute OEI , \\nor even 30 second OEI runs. \\n(6) To request the exception to the gas temperature stabilization for the 30-second test \\nrun segments in § 33.87(b)(5), the applicant should follow the conditions specified in paragraph 3-4.b.(4)(b) of this AC.  Similarly, for exceptio ns to §§ 33.87(c)(6), (d)(6), and (e)(2), follow the \\nguidance as provided in the corresponding paragraphs 3-5.f, 3-6.e, and 3-7 of this AC. \\n14 \\n\\n   \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n \\n    \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n  \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(7) If the applicant demonstrates that the gas temperature stabilization exception is \\npermitted during the 30-second test run segments in §§ 33.87(b)(5), (c)(6), (d)(6), and (e)(2), \\nthen the total run time that can be claimed at takeoff redline gas temperature should be reduced by the 1.25 hour duration of these segments.  For example, the total run time that may be claimed \\nat the takeoff redline gas temperature for compliance with § 33.87(b)(5) is reduced from 18.75 \\nhours (accounting for the §§ 33.87(b)(1) and (2)(ii) segments and § 33.87(b)(5) segments)  to 17.5 hours (which accounts for the §§ 33.87(b)(1) and (2)(ii) segments only).  We will, however, still accept this reduced takeoff power redline run time to meet the redline gas temperature run time requirements of §§ 33.87(a)(3) and (a)(8). \\n(8) During t he test segments run at gas temperature below the 100 percent redline, \\nbecause the gas temperature stabilization exception is permitted , the applicant should maintain \\nthe rated thrust or power with rotor speeds (i.e., N1 and N2) at or above redline values. \\n(9) The applicant should qualify the engine with the same exhaust gas temperature \\nstabilization characteristics that it will display in service. \\n(10) The applicant should control the engine using the same exhaust gas temperature \\nmeasurement and control system that it will use in service. \\n(11) At least one endurance test cycle must be run with fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid at \\nthe minimum pressure limit, and at least one endurance test cycle must be run with fuel, oil, and hydraulic fluid at the maximum pressure limit.  During each of these two cycles, the fuel, oil, and \\nhydraulic fluid pressures must be maintained at their maximum or minimum values simultaneously.  The applicant may artificially adjust the fluid temperature with a test facility heat exchanger to achieve the desired value, or may use other means if it is shown not to affect \\nthe test outcome. \\nh. Transient overspeed, overtemperature, and overtorque demonstrations for a maximum \\nperiod of 30 seconds, § 33.87(a)(8) . \\n(1) Requested transient conditions that are being certified as part of an engine rating \\nlimitation must be demonstrated during the acceleration cycles required by §§ 33.87(b) through \\n(f), as applicable. \\n(2) A transient  condition, referred to in § 33.87(a)(8), is rotor speed, gas temperature, \\nor shaft torque value that exceeds the approved limit for a period of 30 seconds or less for \\ntransients associated with the takeoff, continuous OEI, and 30- minute OEI ratings. Applicants \\nshould limit r otor speed, gas temperature, or shaft torque transients associated with the 2 ½-\\nminute, 2-minute, and 30-second OEI ratings to very brief periods of 10 seconds maximum. \\nNote: The FAA has approved transient overtemperatures that \\nexceeded 30 seconds and up to 2 minutes.  However, § 33.87(a)(8) is intended and remains suitable to evaluate rotor speed and gas temperature transient overtemperature for periods of 30 seconds or \\n15 \\n\\n   \\n    \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n   \\n      \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n  \\n      \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nless. See appendix 7 of this AC for guidance on two -minute \\ntransient overtemperature limit approval. \\n(3) Applicants may not use t ransient limits as supplementary limitations, regardless of \\ntheir duration, for engine power setting purposes.  The transient limits of shaft overspeed , gas \\noverte mperature, and shaft overtorque prescribed in §§ 33.7(c)(14), (c)(15), and (c)(16), \\nrespectively, are intend ed for a transitory overshoot before reaching steady -state limit values \\nfollowing an engine acceleration in normal operation. \\n(a) If the number of occurrences of transient conditions up to 30 seconds is limited \\nin normal engine operation, then the same number of accelerations required by §§ 33.87(b) through (g) must be made to the limiting transient conditions during the endurance test. \\n(b) If the number of occurrences of the transient conditions is not limited in \\nnormal engine operation, then at least 50 percent of the required endurance test accelerations must be made to the limiting transient conditions.  For example, §§ 33.87(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(5) require a total of 310 acceleration s (150, 10, and 150, respectively) to takeoff power or \\nthrust.  Therefore, a minimum of 155 (50 percent of 310) accelerations must be made to the limiting takeoff power transient conditions  during the endurance test. \\n(c) Section  33.87(a)(7) defines the basis for a possible exception to the \\nrequirement under § 33.87(a)(3) to maintain gas temperature at the 100 percent, or redline value, to be certificated during all takeoff test segments.  Although an applicant may present data showing that an engine cannot achieve a stabilized takeoff redline gas temperature during the \\n30-second takeoff power segments  under § 33.87(b)(5) , these accelerations to takeoff power still \\ncount toward the total 310 accelerations required during the endurance test. \\n(4) We recommend conducting the transient condition test runs during the 150 \\naccelerations to the 5 -minute takeoff test segments of §§ 33.87(b)(1) , (c)(1), (d)(1), and (e)(1) \\nand during the 10 accelerations to the 30- minute takeoff test segments of §§ 33.87(b) (2)(ii), (c) \\n(2)(ii), (d) (2)(ii), and (e) (2).  Some turbine engines, particularly large turbofan models, may not reach a stabilized gas temperature during the 30-second takeoff power segments of the test \\nsequence under § 33.87(b)(5).  We do not recommend attempting to run the transient tests during these segments, unless the transient duration to be certified is short enough to allow gas temperature stabilization at the required transient condition. \\ni.

Advisory C ircular 33.87-2, provides \\nguidance on showing compliance with §  33.87 for PMAs by the means of comparative test \\nmethods. \\nb. Endurance test for multiple engine testing . \\n(1) When all engine parameters (thrust , power, torque, speed, and gas temperature) \\ncannot be held at redline conditions simultaneously during the endurance test, then the applicant may conduct more than one test, so that all required testing is completed  at redline conditions.  \\nHowever, applicants should conduct all endurance testing on the same set of engine hardware to be presented for certification. \\n(2) Appendix 3 of this AC presents additional information on an acceptable endurance \\ntest cycle for multiple engine tests. \\n3-4. Endurance Test Schedule, § 33.87(b), for Engines Other Than Certain Rotorcraft \\nEngines . \\na. Explanation . \\n(1) The applicant must perform this endurance test cycle 25 times , for a total of 150 \\nhours of testing on all turbojet, turbofan, and turbopropeller engines.  The endurance test cycle is \\nalso required for rotorcraft turbine engines, except those rotorcraft engines for which the \\n30-minute OEI rating, continuous OEI rating, or 2½-minute OEI rating are desired.  The 150 hours of testing time will accumulate 18.75 hours at takeoff power rating, 45 hours at maximum continuous power rating, 62.5 hours at incremental power step time period, and 23.75 hours at minimum idle condition. This endurance test cycle for § 33.87(b) is presented graphically in \\nappendix 1, figures 1 and 2 of t his AC . \\n(2) The test engine must maintain  the rated power or thrust.  Advisory C ircular 33.7-1 \\nprovides information and guidance on the engine ratings and associated limitations. Specifically, \\nthe methods, ambient conditions, and engine configuration the applicant should use to establish and demonstrate the ratings that are then applied during the endurance test. \\n(a) The minimum physical power or thrust value required for testing under \\n§ 33.87(b) may be adjusted from the actual testing conditions to the conditions specified in the TCDS under which the rated power or thrust is determined.  Applicants are not allowed to adjust the physically measured power or thrust to account for losses due to speci al test hardware that is \\nincidental only to the conduct of the test.  Special test hardware, such as fan inlet or exit guide \\nvanes, an adjustable fan exhaust nozzle, or an altitude test cell, may be required to achieve simultaneous rotor shaft rotational speed and gas temperature redline conditions ; however, the \\nengine may not be able to produce physical rated power or thrust under these operating \\n17 \\n\\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n  \\n        \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n    \\n \\n  \\n      \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n        \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nconditions.  The shortfall in physical power or thrust may result in insufficient loading on load-\\ncarrying memb ers of the engine, such as thrust bearings, struts, mounts, and cases to comply \\nwith the requirements under § 33.87(a)(3). \\n(b) The applicant may propose data to justify the power or thrust shortfall when \\nthe minimum physical power or thrust target cann ot be achieved .  The data should address the \\nengine parts that are affected by the power or thrust magnitude and should show that their \\ndurability is not affected. We will review the proposal to see if it needs to be evaluated as an \\nequivalent level of safety under § 21.21(b)(1). \\n(c) For all test conditions, the applicant should identify in the test plan the \\nparameters relevant to the purpose of the test  together with the appropriate times for their \\nrecording d uring the test.   Except during transient conditions, the applicant should allow the \\nengine to stabilize before recording the data. \\nb. Guidance . Unless we approve an alternate sequence, the test must include the following \\nruns defined in §§ 33.87(b)(1) t hrough (b)(6). All accelerations to rated power or thrust must \\nstart from minimum idle power condition and all decelerations must return to minimum idle power condition. \\n(1) Section 33.87(b)(1), Takeoff and idling.  The intent of this requirement is to expose \\nthe engine hardware to the maximum cyclic thermal and mechanical stresses associated with accelerations and decelerations between the lowest operating power or thrust condition (minimum idle) and the maximum operating power or thrust condition (tak eoff). All certifying \\nparameters, such as rated thrust or power or rated torque for rotorcraft and turbo-propeller engines, maximum permissible speeds and gas temperature, should stabilize for 5 minutes at the \\ntakeoff power condition redline values.  Similarly, power or thrust should be maintained for 5 minutes at the minimum idle condition following stabilization. \\n(a) Applicants should conduct one hour of alternate 5-minute periods at rated \\ntakeoff power or thrust and at minimum idle power or thrust with the following requirements: \\n1Prior to beginning any of the 5-minute takeoff segments, the physical rotor \\nspeeds, indicated gas temperature,  and physical thrust or power should be stabilized at or above \\nthe takeoff power values to be certified per § 33.87(a)(3), unless the applicant elects to run more \\nthan one 150-hour endurance test.  See appendix 3 of this AC for multiple endurance test requirements. \\n2Prior to beginning any of the 5- minute minimum idle segments of the test \\nrun, the physical rotor speeds and physical power or thrust should be at or below the minimum idle power operating values to be certified.  While the indicated gas temperature may continue to cool after the 5 -minute minimum idle part has begun, it should stabilize at the nominal minimum \\nidle power operating temperature consistent with the ambient test conditions prior to beginning the next acceleration to the takeoff thrust or power level. \\n18 \\n\\n   \\n     \\n  \\n    \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n        \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n      \\n \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n \\n        \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(b) For engines with augmented takeoff thrust ratings that involve an increase in \\nturbine inlet temperature, rotor speed, or shaft power, all test runs at takeoff power or thrust must \\nbe at the augmented takeoff rating. For engi nes with augmented takeoff thrust ratings that do not \\nmaterially increase operating severity: \\n1If use of the rating is not limited, all takeoff runs must be made at the \\naugmented rating , and \\n2If use of the rating is limited, the limited numbe r of runs conducted at the \\naugmented rating must be made at the augmented rated  thrust. \\n(c) In complying with § 33.87(b)(1), the power -control lever should be moved \\nfrom one extreme position to the other in one second or less.  If the applicant incorporates \\ndifferent regimes  of control operation requiring control scheduling, then a longer period of time \\nis acceptable, but for not more than two seconds.  Examples of different modes of control operations requiring control scheduling are separate stops or detents in the power-control level lever for another rating, which is incorporated between idle and takeoff thrust or power, and which requires scheduling of the power-control lever motion in going from one extreme position to the othe r. \\n(d) All accelerations should start from the minimum idle power or thrust, and all \\ndecelerations should return to the minimum idle power or thrust. \\n(2) Section s 33.87(b)(2) and (b)(3), Rated maximum continuous and takeoff thrust or \\npower. \\n(a) In complying with these two requirements , the engine must run 15 of the 25 \\nendurance test cycles at the rated  maximum continuous thrust or power for two hours during \\neach cycle.  The engine must run the remaining 10 of the 25 endurance test cycles at the r ated \\ntakeoff power or thrust for 30 minutes followed immediately by running at maximum continuous power or thrust for 1.5 hours during each endurance test cycle. \\n(b) Prior to beginning the test run at either the maximum continuous rating or the \\ntakeoff  rating, the physical rotor speeds, indicated gas temperature, and physical thrust or power \\nmust be at or above the redline values for each rating to be certificated. \\n(c) If the applicant does not plan to define redline rotor speeds for the maximum \\ncontinuous rating, then the takeoff redline rotor speeds will also be the required redline rotor \\nspeeds for the maximum continuous rating segments. \\n(d) The cycle profile shown in figure 1 in appendix 1 of this AC depicts an \\napparent acceleration from idle to the maximum continuous power or thrust to begin the 30-minute segments that are required for 15 of the 25 cycles under § 33.87(b)(2) (i); however, \\nthat depiction is only used to simplify the presentation of the cycle profile.  These 30- minute \\nsegments m ay also be started after a deceleration from the last 5 -minute takeoff power or thrust \\nsegment under § 33.87(b)(1).

These 10 accelerations are an integral part of the \\nrequirement to complete 310 accelerations to takeoff power or thrust in the test under § 33.87(b). \\n(3) Section 33.87(b)(4), Incremental cruis e power and thrust. \\n(a) In complying with this requirement, the applicant must run all 25 of these \\nsegments for 2 hours and 30 minutes at equal speed and time increments  by moving the power \\nlever .  Specifically, the successive power lever positions must correspond to at least 15 \\napproximately equal speed and time increments between maximum continuous engine rotational \\nspeed and minimum idle rotational speed.  However, if the engine exhibits significant peak vibration anywhere between the minimum idle  and maximum continuous rating conditions, the \\napplicant should increase the number of increments to increase the amount of running time made \\nwhile subject to the peak vibrations, up to no more than 50 percent of the total time spent in incremental running.  Applicants may vary thrust and power in place of rotor speed f or engines \\noperating at constant rotor speed. \\n1If the applicant finds any significant vibration within the operating range of \\nthe engine, then the relevant parts or components should be subject to sufficient vibration running time at, or close to, the resonance peak speed.  The vibration characteristic data for each rotor system may be obtained from the vibration test conducted under § 33.83.  The running time allocated for any peak vibrat ion should be sufficient to accumulate at least the minimum \\nvibration cycles for endurance limit. Based on industry practices, t he recommended minimum \\nnumber of dwell cycles at each step is 10 million .  The required dwell time spent at each selected \\nspeed  depends on the frequency of the vibration resonance.  The applicant may calculate the test \\ntime by dividing the number of cycles by the frequency. \\n2Any engine vibration that occurs within the declared operating speed \\nranges, including transients, is considered significant when it occurs at or near a known \\nresonance point, or within a steady-state speed operation and presents any of the following characteristics : \\n(aa) Amplitudes that indicate stresses near the endurance limits , or \\n(bb) Amplitudes or frequencies that may affect the functionality of engine \\nrotors, systems, or components. \\n3The relevant engine parts or components for vibration dwell consideration \\nunder § 33.87(b)(4) should include internal and external components of t he engine.  For \\nexample,  consider blades, stators, turbine or compressor assemblies, pumps, and the oil tank. \\n(4) Section 33.87( b)(5), 30 minutes of accelerations and deceleration runs. \\n20 \\n\\n   \\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n         \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(a) In complying with this requirement, all 25 endurance test cycles must contain \\none 30-minute run per cycle consisting of alternating 30-second periods at rated takeoff thrust or \\npower immediately followed by 4.5 minutes at idling thrust or power. \\n1All accelerations should start from minimum idle thrust or power and all \\ndecelerations should return to minimum idle thrust or power.  During runs at rated thrust or \\npower , if the redline gas temperature is expected to stabilize within a 30-second period, then the \\nphysical speeds , indicated gas temperature, and physical thrust or power must be at or above the \\nredline values and must be maintained for at least 30 seconds as required under § 33.87(a)(3).  If \\nthe redline gas temperature does not stabilize within 30 seconds, then only the rated takeoff \\nthrust or power and rotor speeds need to be maintained at or above their 100 percent values to be \\ncertified during each 30-second period.  The power lever control movement requirements \\nspecified in paragraph 3-4.b.(1)(c) of this AC should be followed for all test runs. \\n2Prior to beginning any of the 4.5- minute minimum idle parts of the test run, \\nthe physical speeds and physical power or thrust should be at or below the proposed minimum idle power operating level.  While the indicat ed gas temperature may continue to cool after the \\n4.5-minute minimum idle run part has begun, it should be stabilized at the nominal idle power operating temperature prior to beginning the next acceleration to the takeoff thrust or power level. \\n(b) Section s 33.87(a)(3) and 33.87(a)(7) require that the gas temperature and oil \\ninlet temperature be at least at 100 percent of the value for each rating condition being tested to \\nbe certificated .  Section 33.87(a)(7), however, permits an exception to this requirement for test \\nsegments that are not longer than five minutes and do not allow these parameters to stabilize within those segments at their 100 percent or redline value.  Experience has shown that the gas temperatures of many turbine engines do not stabilize during these 30-second takeoff runs under § 33.87(b)(5).  For these engines, t he applicant may elect to use this option.  If the applicant does \\nnot run this part of the test to redline gas temperature, then the total steady -state run time that can \\nbe claimed at takeoff redline gas temperature will be reduced from 18.75 hours to 17.5 hours.  Before the applicant can use the gas temperature stabilization  exception, the following conditions \\napply: \\n1The applicant should supply data in the test plan showing that the time \\nrequired to achieve gas temperature stabilization at or above the 100 percent value exceeds a 30 second duration in the type design configuration, e.g., a plot of gas t emperature vs. time for a \\ntypical non- bleed cycle acceleration from idle to takeoff power or thrust for a type design engine. \\n2If this data will not be available until the engine is installed in the endurance \\ntest facilities, then the test plan shou ld at least contain a prediction of the engine acceleration \\ncharacteristics and a statement that the exclusion under § 33.87(a)(7) will be sought for the 30-second test run segments under § 33.87(b)(5).  The actual acceleration vs. time plots should then be included in the test report. \\n21 \\n\\n   \\n        \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n \\n \\n      \\n      \\n      \\n \\n      \\n       \\n \\n      \\n        \\n    \\n \\n       \\n       \\n   \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n3Even if the oil or gas temperature stabilization exception is justified , the \\nacceleration and deceleration runs under § 33.87(b)(5) should still be completed in their entirety \\nwith rotor speeds and thrust or power at or above the 100 percent values to be certificated.  \\nAdditionally, the engine test configuration and the acceleration rate of the engine should remain the same as during the per iods under §§ 33.87(b)(1) and (b)(2)(ii). \\n(5) Section 33.87(b)(6), Starts . \\n(a) The purpose of an engine start demonstration is to show that normal starts can \\nbe accomplished without exceeding the maximum starting temperature limit or causing engine hardware distress following: \\n1 A short period of engine shutdown, \\n2 An extended period of engine shutdown, \\n3 Minimum fuel drainage time or engine motoring time to purge \\naccumulated fuel in the engine, or \\n4 A false start . \\n(b) The applicant must conduct 100 engine starts to satisfy the requirements under \\n§ 33.87(b)(6) .  The 100 starts consist of: \\n1Twenty -five normal starts preceded by a minimum 2-hour shutdown. \\n2At least 10 false engine starts, each time pausing for the applicant\\'s specified \\nminimum fuel drainage time before attempting a normal start. These starts are required to \\ndemonstrate the engine’s capability to purge unwanted fuel before energizing the ignition system . \\n3At least 10 normal restarts preceded by a maximum 15 -minute shutdown \\nperiod. \\n4Fifty -five additional normal starts  if 10 false starts and 10 normal restarts are \\nrun.  However, if  more than 10 false starts and/or more than 10 normal restarts are run , there will \\nbe a lesser number of remaining normal starts. \\n(c) A normal start is measured from the initial indication of core rotor speed until \\nstable ground idle speed (core rotor) is reached.  The normal start should follow the ground sta rt \\nprocedure as specified in the engine installation instructions. \\n(d) A false start is conducted as the engine motors on the starter for the maximum \\nlight-off time period, while leaving the igniter  deactivated.  At the end of this time period, the \\nstarter is then disengaged and the power lever is commanded to the fuel cutoff position.  After \\nthe engine comes to a complete stop, a normal engine start is made.

Endurance Test Schedule, § 33.87(e), for Rotorcraft Engines for which a 2½- minute \\nOEI Power Rating is Desired . \\na. Explanation . \\n(1) The maximum gross weight of a multiengine rotorcraft is limited by the power \\navailable from the remaining operating engine(s) when one engine fails or is shutdown during flight. Flight performance analysis has shown that in the event of engine failure at the critical \\npoint during take-off or landing, a period of higher power, referred to as 2½ -minute OEI power, \\nis required to lift the aircraft, gain forward speed, clear obstructions in the flight path, and climb to a safe altitude. \\n(2) Once the aircraft has reached a safe altitude, a longer period at a lower power, \\nwhich is equal to or higher than maximum continuous power, is required to continue the fight \\nuntil able to reach a suitable landing site.  This power level will be rated maximum continuous, \\n30-minute OEI, or continuous OEI power depending on the rating structure of the engine.  For these reasons, the endurance test schedules for the 2½-minute OEI rating are structured to run under one of the following three combinations of ratings: \\n(a) Rated takeoff, maximum continuous, and 2½- minute OEI , or \\n(b) Rated takeoff, maximum continuous, 2½-minute OEI, and 30- minute OEI , or \\n(c) Rated takeoff, maximum continuous, 2½-minute OEI, and continuous OEI. \\n(3) See appendix 9 of this AC for more information on rotorcraft operation at the 2½\\xad\\nminute OEI condition. \\n(4) The schedules prescribed in §§ 33.87(e)(1) and (e)(2) are required for rotorcraft \\nengines for which the applicant desires a 2½ -minute OEI power rating.  The applicant should \\nselect one of the three combinations of ratings in paragraphs 3-7.a. (2)(a), (2)(b) and (2)(c) above \\nfor the engine model being certified and apply the associated test schedules for compliance with \\nendurance test requirements. \\n(5) See figures 7 through 11 in appendix 1 of this AC for a graph re presentation of the \\n§ 33.87(e) test schedules. \\nb. Guidance . The test must include the runs specified in §§ 33.87(e)(1) and (e)(2), unless \\nwe approve an alternat e test sequence.  The guidance described in paragraphs 3-4.a.(2) of this \\nAC for the required minimum physical power and the general endurance test requirements prescribed in § 33.87(a), apply to this test schedule. \\n(1) Section 33.87(e)(1), Takeoff, 2½- minute OEI  and idling.  This guidance is the same \\nas that given for § 33.87(b)(1) under “Guidance” in paragraph 3-4.b.(1), except that during the third and sixth takeoff power periods in each of the alternate 5-minute periods, only 2.5 minutes \\n26 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n    \\n      \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nneed be conducted at rated takeoff power.  The applicant should conduct the remaining 2.5 minutes at rated 2½ -minute OEI power. \\n(2) Section 33.87(e)(2).  In complying with this paragraph, the applicant should select \\none of the options in the following paragraphs, depending on the rating structure of the engine: \\n(a) For engines with rated takeoff, maximum continuous, and 2½- minute OEI \\npower ratings , the guidance is the same as that given for §§ 33.87(b)(2) through (b)(6) under \\n“Guidance” in paragraphs 3 -4.b.(2) through b.(5) of this AC, except that in the last one of the 25 \\nendurance test cycles under § 33.87(b)(2)(ii), the last 5 minutes must be run at 2½ -minute OEI \\npower rating. \\n(b) For engines with rated takeoff, maximum continuous, 2½-minute OEI, and \\n30-minute OEI ratings , the guidance is the same as that given for § 33.87(c)(2) through (c)(7) in \\nparagraphs 3-5.c through 3-5.f of this AC, except that, during the last of the 25 endurance test \\ncycles , the last 5 minutes of § 33.87(c)(4) 30 minutes run at the 30-minute OEI power must be \\nrun at the 2½-minute OEI power. \\n(c) For engines with rated takeoff, maximum continuous, 2½-minute OEI, and \\ncontinuous OEI ratings, the guidance is the same as that given for § 33.87(d)(2) through (d)(7) described in paragraphs 3-6.b through 3-6.e of this AC, except that during the last of the 25 endurance test cycles, the last 5 minutes of § 33.87(d)(4) one hour run at continuous OEI must be run at 2½- minute OEI power rating. \\n(d) See appendix 10 of this AC for the accumulated testing times for 150 hours of \\ntesting to these three schedules. \\n3-8. Endurance Test Schedule, § 33.87(f), for Rotorcraft E ngines for which 30-second OEI \\nand 2 -minute OEI Ratings are D esired . \\na. The 30-second OEI and 2- minute  OEI power ratings . When used in combination, t he \\n30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI power rating s enable rotorcraft to perform a mission very \\nsimilar to that of the 2½ -minute OEI power rating described in section 3- 7.a, “Explanation ,” of \\nthis AC .  There are, however, significant differences between these ratings. \\n(1) The use of the 2½- minute OEI rating is not limited to a certain number of \\noccurrences, while the use of the 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings is limited to three \\noccurrences during a sing le flight. In service, use of the 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI \\nratings is likely  once per flight with a required mandatory inspection after that flight. However, \\nwe have defined certification requirements around the worst-case scenario involving the possible \\nuse of the rating three times in one flight; takeoff, balked landing, and final landing of a \\nrotorcraft.  The intent of the 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings is to safely use available \\nengine design margins for brief periods of exposure. \\n(2) Inspection and maintenance actions are not required after a flight when the \\n2½-minute OEI rating  is used.  Inspection and maintenance actions, however, are required after a \\n27 \\n\\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n  \\n \\n      \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n      \\n       \\n       \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nflight when either the 30-second OEI or the 2- minute OEI rating is used .  This difference is \\nsupported by the pass or fail criteria of the teardown ins pection requirements in § 33.93.  \\nFollowing the endurance test for the engine’s 2½- minute OEI rating , the teardown inspection \\nmust show that all engine parts are in a condition for safe operation in compliance with \\n§ 33.93(a)(2).  Following the endurance test for the engine’s 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI \\nratings , the teardown inspection must show that the engine maintain s its structural integrity in \\ncompliance with § 33.93(b)(2).  Note that use of the 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings \\nmay result in component or part deterioration beyond serviceable limits, making these \\ncomponents unavailable for further use.  See appendix 9 of this AC for more information on use \\nof 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI rating s for rotorcraft . \\nb. Endurance test for 30-second and 2- minute OEI ratings . The endurance test comprises \\nof the 150 hour test run under §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), or (e), as applicable to the engine OEI ratings \\nstructure, followed by a supplementary 2-hour test under § 33.87(f).  See figures 12 and 13 in \\nappendix 1 of this AC for graph re presentation s of the § 33.87(f) test schedules. \\n(1) Following the tests in § 33.87(b), (c), (d), or (e), the applicant may disassemble the \\ntested engine to the extent necessary to show compliance with the requirements of § 33.93(a).  The applicant must then reassemble the tested engine using the same engine parts used for the 150-hour endurance test run under §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), or (e), except for those parts that are defined as consumable in the ICA.  The level of component cleaning to facilitate the inspection \\nprior to rebuild for the test under § 33.87(f) should be acceptable to us.  The applicant should \\nshow that any cleaning during the teardown inspection, or replacement of consumable parts, will not enhance the engine’s ability to meet  the requirements under § 33.93(b). \\n(2) The applicant may elect to continue the 2 -hour test under § 33.87(f) without an \\nintervening disassembly and inspection.  In this case, the applicant must show that, after the test, the condition of engine parts and components comply with § 33.93(a) instead of § 33.93(b). \\nc. Test conduct . All requirements under § 33.87(a) apply to the conduct of the 2-hour test, \\nexcept as permitted by § 33.87(f) and as discussed further in this section.   The required minimum \\nphysical power and general endurance test requirements described in section 3-4.a, \\n“Explanation ,” of this AC for § 33.87(b) apply to this test schedule.  In changing the power \\nsetting at the beginning and the end of each test sequence, the applicant should move the power control lever from one position to the other in no more than one second. \\nd. Test sequences . \\n(1) The applicant must conduct the prescribed 2- hour test sequence specified in \\n§§ 33.87(f)(1) through (f)(8) a total of four times as follows: \\n(a) Three minutes at rated takeoff power; \\n(b) Thirty seconds at rated 30-second OEI power; \\n(c) Two minutes at rated 2 -minute OEI power; \\n28 \\n\\n   \\n \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n       \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n      \\n    \\n      \\n      \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(d) Five minutes at whichever is the greatest of rated 30 -minute OEI power, rated \\ncontinuous OEI power, or rated maximum continuous power, except that this period must be 65 minutes  during the first test sequence.  However, where the greatest rated power is 30 -minute \\nOEI power, that 65-minute period must consist of 30 minutes at 30-minute OEI power followed by 35 minutes at continuous OEI power or maximum continuous power, whichever is greater ; \\n(e) One minute at 50 percent takeoff power; \\n(f) Thirty seconds at rated 30-second OEI power; \\n(g) Two minutes at rated 2 -minute OEI power; and \\n(h) One minute at minimum flight idle condition. \\n(2) The applicant must run the test sequences in §§ 33.87(f)(1) thr ough (f)(8) four \\ntimes, continuously and without stopping.  In the event of a stoppage, the applicant should repeat the interrupted sequence in full, or the sequence may be restarted from the interruption point if there are technical justifications acceptable to us.  If we determine that the sequence does not need to be repeated in its entirety, the applicant should restart the test from a point where the engine thermal condition would be the same as at the time of interruption.  If we determine that the number of interruptions is excessive, the applicant should repeat the entire test under § 33.87(f). \\ne. Test time . The accumulated time of two  hours of testing is split among four test \\nsequences.   The total duration of the first sequence is 75 minutes, while the duration for \\nsequences 2, 3, and 4 is 15 minutes each.  The time difference between these sequences is a result of the requirements under 33.87(f)(4).  These requirements also dictate different test schedules for the first sequence depending on t he other ratings that the certification engine has. \\nThe intent of the power level of test condition under § 33.87(f)(4) is to demonstrate the highest en route OEI or non- OEI power. The following are test time breakdown s among the four \\nsequences account ing for different engine ratings scenarios (see tables  1 and 2 below). \\n(1) Test time breakdown when (a) t he engine does not have a 30 -minute OEI rating , or \\n(b) the 30- minute OEI rating is less than either the continuous OEI, or the maximum continuous \\nratings, or both (see table 1). \\n29 \\n\\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n                  \\n \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n       \\n \\n       \\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nTable 1. \\nSequence 1 \\n33.87 \\nsection Takeoff \\n(minutes) 30-sec \\nOEI \\n(minutes) 2-min \\nOEI \\n(minutes) Flight \\nidle \\n(minutes) Greatest of \\ncontinuous \\nOEI or \\nmaximum \\ncontinuous \\n(minutes) 50% takeoff \\n(minutes) \\nf(1) 3 \\nf(2) 0.5 \\nf(3) 2 \\nf(4) 65 \\nf(5) 1 \\nf(6) 0.5 \\nf(7) 2 \\nf(8) 1 \\nSequences 2, 3, and 4 \\nf(1) 3 \\nf(2) 0.5 \\nf(3) 2 \\nf(4) 5 \\nf(5) 1 \\nf(6) 0.5 \\nf(7) 2 \\nf(8) 1 \\nTotal \\ntest \\ntime \\n(min) 12 4 16 4 80 4 \\n(2) Test time breakdown when the 30- minute OEI r ating is greater  than both the \\nco ntinuous OEI and the max imum continuous ratings (see tab le 2). \\n30 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n       \\n  \\n     \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n \\n                     \\n \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n  \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n        \\n \\n        \\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nTable 2. \\nSequence 1 \\n33.87 \\nsection Takeoff \\n(minutes) 30-sec \\nOEI \\n(minutes) 2-min \\nOEI \\n(minutes) Flight \\nidle \\n(minutes) 30-min \\nOEI \\n(minutes) Greatest of \\nContinuous \\nOEI or \\nmaximum \\ncontinuous \\n(minutes) 50% \\ntakeoff \\n(minutes) \\nf(1) 3 \\nf(2) 0.5 \\nf(3) 2 \\nf(4) 30 35 \\nf(5) 1 \\nf(6) 0.5 \\nf(7) 2 \\nf(8) 1 \\nSequences 2, 3, and 4 \\nf(1) 3 \\nf(2) 0.5 \\nf(3) 2 \\nf(4) 5 \\nf(5) 1 \\nf(6) 0.5 \\nf(7) 2 \\nf(8) 1 \\nTotal \\ntest \\ntime \\n(min) 12 4 16 4 30 50 4 \\nf. Air bleed during test . During the test in § 33.87(f), maximum air bleed for engine and \\naircraft services under § 33.87(a)(5) do not need to be used if the applicant can show by test, or \\nanalysis based on testing, that the engine’s ability to meet the teardown inspection requireme nts \\nof § 33.93 is not enhanced.  We permit this exception to reduce test complexity and improve the \\nflexibility needed to attain key parameters  during the test ( rotational speed, temperature and \\ntorque).  The analysis should include: \\n(1) The effect of the bleed air extraction on the engine secondary air system which \\nprovides cooling air to various engine components, and \\n(2) The thermodynamic cycle effects of bleed (for example, core speed to output shaft \\nspeed changes). \\ng.

If, during testing the accessory drives and \\nmounting attachments are not loaded, the applicant must add the equivalent power extraction to \\n31 \\n\\n   \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n    \\n \\n        \\n \\n \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n       \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nthe engine shaft output drive , as required  under § 33.87(a)(6) (iii).  This is so that the power \\nturbine rotor assembly is operated at or above the same levels as if the accessory drives and mounting attachments were loaded. \\nh. Engine operating limitations . The engine operating limitations of the 30-second and \\n2-minute OEI ratings should be based on the minimum values obtained during the application of \\nthe 2 -hour test under § 33.87(f).  Further, the applicant should identify the limitations in the \\nTCDS. The applicant  should also account for stabilization time , instrumentation range of \\naccuracy , and automatic control s features declared under §§ 33.29(c) and 33.28(k). \\n3-9. Endurance Test Schedule, § 33.87(g), Supersonic Aircraft Engines. We may address the \\ntest requirements of supersonic aircraft engines in a future AC. \\n3-10. Endurance Test Schedule, § 33.84, Engine O vertorque T est. \\na. Maximum engine overtorque test, § 33.84. These requirements apply to turbopropeller \\nand turboshaft engines that incorporate a free power turbine.  The test requirements may be \\naddressed as part of the endurance test of §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), or (e).  This guidance only applies \\nwhen maximum engine overtorque testing is incorporated in the endurance test schedule of \\n§ 33.87. This guidance does not address the alternative tests available under § 33.84(a)(1). \\nb. Maximum engine overtorque . The maximum engine overtorque is permitted for all \\nengine ratings, except for the 30-second and 2- minute OEI ratings, as stated by  § 1.1, General \\ndefinitions. \\n(1) The maximum engine overtorque is an \"over the limit\\'\\' condition that could last up \\nto 20 seconds, and which occurs inadvertently .  After this condition occurs , the engine must \\nremain operational without any maintenance action other than to correct the cause. The applicant  should identify the failure modes that could produce engine overtorque conditions.  F or \\nexample, sudden changes in the rotorcraft or aircraft b lade pitch or power demand, such as an \\nengine failure on a twin engine rotorcraft, can cause a significant decrease in the rotor or \\npropeller speed. \\n(2) When overtorque conditions may occur in association with more than a single \\nrating, the applicant should declare the highest torque value as the maximum engine overtorque.  \\nThe applicant should apply this value during the maximum overtorque test. \\nc. Test conditions . The required test conditions specified in § 33.84(b) apply to the \\ndeclared  maximum engine overtorque.  The applicant should incorporate the test into the \\nendurance sequence for the rated power where the overtorque occurs.  For example, when the maximum overtorque is associated with the 30- minute OEI rating, the 15 minute test time \\nrequired in § 33.84(b)(1) may be incorporated into § 33.87(c)(4), either by running the entire 15 minutes during one of the 25 endurance cycles, or splitting the 15 minutes among the 25 endurance cycles into periods of not less than 2½ minutes each.  The following test parameters \\napply: \\n32 \\n\\n   \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(1) The power turbine rotational speed must be equal to the highest speed at which the \\nmaximum overtorque can occur in service.  I t should not exceed the limit speed associated with \\nthe rating for which the maximum o vertorque is considered. \\n(2) The turbine- entry gas temperature must be equal to the maximum steady -state \\ntemperature approved for use during periods longer than 20 seconds when operating at conditions not associated with 30-second or 2- minute OEI rating s.  We may waive the \\nrequirement to run the test at the maximum approved steady- state temperature if the applicant \\nshows that other testing provides the desired temperature effects when considered in combination \\nwith the other parameters identified in §§ 33.84(b)(1), (b)(2), and (b)(3 ). \\n(3) The engine oil temperature should be within the normal operating range .  For \\nengines incorporating a reduction gearbox, the gearbox oil temperature must be equal to the \\nmaximum temperature when the maximum engine ove rtorque could occur in service. \\nd Post- test engine inspection . The engine subjected to the maximum overtorque during \\nthe endurance test under § 33.87 must meet the teardown inspection requirements, §§ 33.93(a)(1) \\nand (a)(2), which we discuss further in chapter 4 of this AC. \\n33 \\n\\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    \\n     \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n      \\n \\n    \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n         \\n  \\n    \\n      \\n      \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n       \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nChapter 4.  Teardown Inspection \\n4-1. General Requirements for All Endurance Tests (Except for Engines with 30 -second \\nOEI and 2 -minute OEI Ratings), § 33.93(a). The applicant must completely disassemble each \\nengine after the 150-hour endurance test under §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), (e), or (g).  For r otorcraft \\nengines with 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings , the applicant may complete the \\nendurance testing under §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), or (e), and then start the testing under § 33.87(f) \\nwithout intervening disassembly and inspection.  For  this option, the applicable teardo wn \\ninspection requirements are those of § 33.93(a)  instead of § 33.93(b).  The FAA’s Manufactur ing \\nInspection D istrict O ffice inspector may need to witness the teardown inspection activities. \\na. Section 33.93(a)(1) . The applicant must verify that the adjustment setting and \\nfunctioning characteristics of each engine component are within the limits established and \\nrecorded in compliance with § 33.82 before the endurance test .  These components include, at \\nthe minimum, engine control system components, pumps, actuators, heat exchanger, and valves. \\nb. Section 33.93(a)(2) . \\n(1) Explanation. \\n(a) The engine and engine parts or components must conform to their type design \\nconsisting of the data and information prescribed under § 21.31.  In addition, allowances are \\npermitted for used part conditions provided by the information submi tted in compliance with \\n§ 33.4 or the TCDS , which  includes the engine manual  or overhaul manual limits , as applicable. \\n(b) The phrase, “eligible for incorporation into an engine for continued operation,” \\nmeans that the installation of the part will continue to keep the engine in an airworthy condition. \\nAn aircraft engine is “airworthy”  when it conforms to its approved design and is in a condition \\nfor safe operation , see 14 CFR part 21.1(3)(b)(1). \\n(2) Guidance. \\n(a) The applicant should inspect all engine parts and components  in both “dirty” \\nand “cleaned” conditions using the ICA inspection instructions.  The applicant should record the \\nfindings in the certification report.  The engine parts and components must conform to their type \\ndesign after accounting for allowances for used parts condition.  Appendix 11 of this AC \\nprovides more detailed guidance for teardown inspections. \\n(b) The dirty inspection after the endurance test is necessary to preserve evidence \\nthat may be lost after cleaning, such as oil-coked parts, temperature affected parts, metal \\nparticles, and soot deposits.  The  applicant may conduct the dirty inspection at the individual part \\nlevel, partial assembly, or complete assembly level.  The degree of disassembly and dirty layout \\nlargely depends on observations made before and during disassembly of the engine or \\ncomponents.  The applicant shouldn’ t clean any engine part or fully disassemble the test engine \\nwithout completing the dirty inspection at each step , or otherwise the applicant may request \\ndeviation from this guidance. \\n34 \\n\\n   \\n \\n       \\n      \\n \\n      \\n      \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n      \\n \\n   \\n \\n       \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n  \\n         \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(c) The clean inspection should include the following: \\n1 A visual inspection for unacceptable wear , e.g. , galling, distortion, or \\ncracks . \\n2 A nondestructive inspection for cracks or incipient failures. \\n3 A dimensional inspection for wear, growth, rub, or distortion. \\n4 A visual , bench , or teardown inspection, or all, of controls, component, \\nand accessory hardware. \\n(d) The applicant should use the results from the “dirty” and “clean” inspections to \\ndetermine if the parts conform to the type des ign and are eligible to be re- installed in the engine \\nfor continued safe operation.  The manufacturing inspector or designee should validate the \\napplicant’s conformity inspection .  The applicant should use the inspection limits in the engine \\nmanual or the overhaul manual (overhaul, heavy maintenance, shop manual, off- wing manual) , \\nas applicable. The applicant should document any part that no longer conforms to its type design \\nin the test report. \\n(e) When an engine part exceeds the manual inspection limit(s), the applicant \\nmay: \\n1 Change the manual inspection limit to agree with the results of the \\nendurance test .  In this case, the applicant should show that the part conforming to the new \\nmanual inspection limits remains in airworthy condition between maintenance periods (e.g., \\ninspections, shop visits, and overhaul) of the engine; or \\n2 Redesign the part to meet the manual inspection limit; or \\n3 Maintain the manual inspection limit, and \\n(aa)  Modify the frequency and procedures of the engine inspection \\nprogram in the ICA to ensure that the part is inspected and removed from service before reaching \\nthe prescribed limit condition, and \\n(bb)Identify in the test report any part condition tha t exceeds manual \\nreturn -to-service limits  and justifies part acceptability. The justification may be based on an \\nengineering analysis and/or service experience from a part of similar type design and must show \\nthat the part in the existing condition is: \\n1) Still airworthy; \\n2) Capable to perform its design functions; and \\n35 \\n\\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n        \\n  \\n       \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n3) Safe for continued engine operation between engine \\nmaintenance periods (inspection, shop visit, and overhaul) as scheduled in the ICA. \\n(f) In the ICA, the applicant may specify inspection and maintenance limits or \\ncriteria that are more conservative than those established for compliance with § 33.93. \\n(g) All engine components must pass post-test inspection and functional tests, \\nsuch as a calibration test or a component accept ance test , when applicable, to ensure that the \\ncomponents are in a condition for continued safe operation and will perform satisfactorily until the next overhaul.  Any component that fails the inspection or functional test, or is a new component using the test under § 33.87 as its sole endurance test, should be torn down for \\ninspection.  Newly designed components, components with major modifications, or components existing on other engine models with significantly different operating conditions  would generally \\nrequire a separate component test under § 33.91(a).  For the component requiring a separate \\ncomponent test, we may waive the post- test teardown inspection after the tests under § 33.87 if \\nthe applicant shows that the component test condition is more severe than the endurance test , and \\nif the teardown inspection will be performed after completing the component test. \\n(h) Certain repairs may be allowed for the endurance test.  These are minor repairs \\nthat are normally required to aid in the engine reassembly after overhaul, such as drive shaft or stub shaft mating surface plating for assembly. \\n4-2. Teardown Inspection Requirements for Engines with 30 -second OEI and 2 -minute \\nOEI Ratings, § 33.93(b) and (c). \\na. After completing the test under  § 33.87(f), the applicant should record the components’ \\nadjustment settings and functional characteristics that can be established independent of \\ninstallation on the engine.  The applicant must show that these adjustment settings and functional \\ncharacteristics remain within the limits that were established and recorded at the beginning of the \\ntest. \\nb. The test under § 33.87(f) for 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings is run following \\na 150-hour endurance test under §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), or (e).  Before starting the endurance test of § 33.87(f), t he applicant may completely disassemble the test engine to show compliance to \\n§ 33.93(a). \\nc. Following completion of the test under § 33.87(f), t he applicant must perform a \\nteardown inspection based on t he pass or fail criteria prescribed in § 33.93(b).  The applicant \\nmust show that no failure of any significant engine component has occurred  during the test or \\nduring the subsequent teardown inspection.  For the purpose of this paragraph, engine components considered significant are those that can affect structural integrity, including, but not \\nlimited to, engine mounts, cases, bearing supports, shafts, and rotors.  If any failure is seen, the \\nfailure should be analyzed.  Further, the applicant should establish by test, analysis, or both, that the cause of the failure is corrected or that certain limitations are imposed on the engine. \\n36 \\n\\n   \\n      \\n   \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n     \\n   \\n      \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nd. The applicant may choose to not disassemble and inspect the engine after completion of \\nthe 150-hour endurance test and prior to starting the supplemental test under § 33.87(f).  In this \\ncase, the applicant must perform the teardown inspection under § 33.93(a) at the end of the 2-hour supplemental test. \\ne. The applicant should document in the test report the component and engine part \\ndeterioration during the test under § 33.87(f).  Such deterioration should not indicate a potentially hazardous condition for the engine.  In addition to the damage that is readily visible , \\nthe applicant should detect and assess damage that is not visible.  Such non- visible damage may \\ninclude the effects of creep, stress rupture, metallurgical effects, or life usage.  The applicant \\nshould consider this overall evaluation when defining and justifying the inspections and mandatory maintenance actions in the ICA. The ICA should include means to proper ly identify \\nthese component conditions, and  should define appropriate maintenance actions for maintaining \\nthe continued airworthiness of the engine. \\n37\\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n           \\n          \\n \\n  \\n          \\n          \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n       \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n       \\n       \\n \\n       \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n        \\n         \\n  \\t \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\t \\n\\t \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\t \\n \\n \\n \\n\\t \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\t \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\t \\n\\t \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\t \\n \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\t \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\t \\n\\t \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\t \\n \\n\\n \\n\\t \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 \\t AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nAppendix  1.

Endurance Test Plan Requirements \\n1. The applicant must prepare a test plan for the endurance test that thoroughly defines the test \\nobjective, test engine, germane or primary test hardware, test facility, test procedures, and the \\npass or fail criteria.  Submit the test plan early enough to allow us sufficient amount of time to \\nreview and approve the plan pri or to the start of the test. \\n2.   The following paragraphs describe types of information included in a test plan for the calibration test, endurance test, and teardown inspection.  We intend this information as a guide to preparing the plan and is not all-inclusive or mandatory. \\na. Description of the Test Objective . The applicant should list the part 33 paragraphs for \\nwhich the tests are intended to show compliance.  Provide a brief description of how each quoted regulation will be complied with by the test(s). \\nb. Test engine configuration . The applicant should identify the test engine configuration.  \\nThe configuration of the test engine must substantially conform to the final type design, however, non-type design hardware, components, and software may be used in the test engine to \\nachieve certain test conditions when approved by us.  For example, the applicant may need to \\nmodify test equipment, engine configurations, and test sequences in ord er to run the test at \\nsimultaneous triple redline conditions.

Endurance Test Cycle f or Multiple Engine Tests \\n1. Regulatory basis for multiple engine tests. \\na. Section 33.87(a)(3) allows for multiple tests if all the associated limits to the engine \\noperating condition being demonstrated cannot be held at the 100 percent level simultaneously.  \\nIf the applicant selects multiple tests to comply with the endurance test requirement, then the applicant must run the additional test(s) in accordance with the prescribed test sequence under §§ 33.87(b) through (g), applicable to all the engine rating conditions (i.e., takeoff, maximum continuous, OEI, and other ratings) being demonstrated.  The applicant must run all of these tests on the same engine hardware the applicant present s for certification. \\nb. For rotorcraft engines for which the applicant desires 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI \\nratings, the applicant must repeat the test sequence defined in § 33.87(f) for not less than 120 \\nminutes. If a second test is required to demonstrate all the limits associated with the engine operating con dition, then the total test time at the desired OEI conditions should not be less than \\n240 minutes. \\nc. Section 33.87(a)(3) also requires that at least 100 percent of the value of all the engine \\noperating parameters associated with a particular engine operating condition must be maintained during the series of runs specified under §§ 33.87(b) through (g), as applicable.  If a parameter limit for a particular engine rating (for example,  rotor speed for maximum continuous rating ) is \\nnot defined, then run the test segments associated with that rating condition to the maximum engine redline condition, as defined in the TCDS. \\n2. Example of multiple engine tests. The following is an example of an acceptable multiple \\nengine test sequence for a turbofan engine in compliance with § 33.87(b).  If during the first test, \\nthe applicant demonstrates simultaneous core rotor speed limit and the gas temperature limit, the \\napplicant  should demonstrate the second test at the fan rotor speed limit and the gas temperature \\nlimit, simultaneously, in accordance with the test sequences defined in §§ 33.87(b)(1), (b)(2)(i), \\n(b)(2)(ii), (b)(3), and (b)(5).  This second demonstration would accumulate an additional 87.5 \\nhours of testing at redline fan speed and gas temperature, resulting in a total time of 237.5 hours \\non the same engine hardware for this endurance test.  The applicant may choose to run the test in two parts (on the same set of engine hardware) as provided in paragraphs a. and b. below. \\na. Part One. Run a standard 150-hour endurance test in accordance with § 33.87(b) at the \\nredline core rotor speed, the gas t emperature limit, and the rated  thrust, simultaneously. \\n(1) During the takeoff parts of the test , the applicant must maintain : \\n(a) The fan rotor speed at the level associated with producing the test parameters \\nin 2.a.(1)(b), (c), and (d) of this paragraph, \\n(b) The core rotor speed at or ab ove the takeoff redline limit, \\n(c) The gas temperature at or above the takeoff redline limits , and \\nA3-1 \\n   \\n \\n     \\n     \\n        \\n  \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n \\n       \\n  \\n \\n       \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n        \\n  \\n      \\n      \\n      \\n     \\n        \\n  \\n       \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(d) The thrust at or above the takeoff rating value. \\n(2) During the maximum continuous parts of the test , the applicant must maintain : \\n(a) The fan rotor speed at the level associated with produci ng the test parameters \\nin 2.a.(2)(b), (c), and (d) of this paragraph, \\n(b) The core rotor speed at the maximum permissible speed associated with the \\nmaximum continuous rating. If a maximum permissible rotor speed is not defined for the \\nmaximum continuous rating, then the maximum continuous test segments must be run to the rotor speed redline limit usually associated with the takeoff rating , \\n(c) The gas temperature at or above the rated maximum continuous limit.  If a gas \\ntemperature limit is not defined for the maximum continuous rating, then the maximum continuous test segments must be run to the maximum gas temperature redline limit usually associated with the takeoff rating , and \\n(d) The thrust at or above the rated  maximum continuous value. \\nb. Part Two . Re-run only the takeoff and maximum continuous parts of the cycle under \\nthe test sequences defined in §§ 33.87(b)(1), (b)(2)(i), (b)(2)(ii), (b)(3), and (b)(5) at fan rotor speed, gas temperature limits, and rated  thrust simultaneously.  The run time for Part Two is 87.5 \\nhours, which consists of 18.75 hours at takeoff power, 45 hours at maximum continuous, and 23.75 hours at minimum idle . \\n(1) During the takeoff parts of the test , the applicant must maintain : \\n(a) The core rotor speed at the level associated with producing the test parameters \\nin 2.b.(1)(b), (c), and (d) of this paragraph, \\n(b) The fan rotor speed at the takeoff redline limit, \\n(c) The gas temperature at the takeoff redline limit , and \\n(d) The thrust at the rated takeoff thrust level. \\n(2) During the maximum continuous parts of the test , the applicant must maintain : \\n(a) The core rotor speed at the level associated with producing the test parameters \\nin 2.b.(2)(b), (c), and (d) of this paragraph, \\n(b) The fan rotor speed at the maximum permissible speed associated with the \\nmaximum continuous rating.  If a maximum permissible rotor speed is not defined for the \\nmaximum continuous rating, then the maximum continuous test segments must be run to the rotor speed redline limit usually associated with the takeoff rating , \\nA3-2 \\n   \\n \\n         \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(c) The gas temperature at the maximum continuous redline limit.

Engine  Configuration Modifications i n Endurance Test \\n1. To run the endurance test at redline conditions simultaneously, i.e., at maximum permissible \\nrotor speeds, gas temperature, and full rated thrust or torque as required by § 33.87(a)(3), the applicant may need to modify the engine configuration or use certain additional facility test equipment.  The applicant should include the modifications to the engine configurations and additional facility test equipment in the test plan .  See appendix 2, paragraphs 2.b. and 2.c. The \\nfollowing methods are commonly used to match engine speeds and temperatures to achieve the desired test conditions. \\na. Change the inlet airflow and condition by: \\n(1) Changing the inlet nozzle area, \\n(2) Installing an inlet grid or scre en to introduce a pressure drop at the inlet, or \\n(3) Heating the inlet air. \\nb. Variable compressor stator vane mis -scheduling. \\nc. Use of customer bleed from high-pressure compressor or low-pressure compressor, or \\nboth. \\nd. Use of a variable area hot section nozzle. \\ne. Use of a variable area exhaust nozzle. \\n2. When one or more of the above methods is chosen, the applicant should provide a technical \\njustification that shows that the tested configuration does not compromise test requirements \\nunder § 33.87 or mask stability issues. 3. Operating the engine at triple redline conditions requires some nonstandard adjustments to \\nthe engine’s designed control and operating characteristics.  These adjustments may result in \\nunintended adverse consequences to some engine design features. \\na. For example, attaining redline core rotor speeds simultaneously with redline gas \\ntemperatures may require off -design point scheduling of the compressor variable stator vanes \\nand other engine hardware.  This in turn may reduce the amount of air that can be bled internally \\nfrom the compressor for pressurization of bearing sump areas and for cooling various high- and low-pressure turbine components.  Section 33.87 does not require that the engine be tested with an engine system , such as these cooling circuits, reduced in capability or effectiveness below the \\ndesign intent level at which it would operate if the engine remained in a type design configuration. \\nb. The applicant may propose minor modifications to the engine to mitigate these \\nunintended consequences.  For example, the applicant may propose restoring the type design \\nA4-1\\n \\n   \\n        \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\ncooling by modifying the compressor internal cooling flow circuit and increase the flow \\nregulating orifice diameters . \\nc. For each proposed modification, the applicant should show in the test plan that the \\nmodification doesn’t enhance the capability to withstand the rigors of the intended test \\nconditions for that modified part or for any other part affected by the modified part. For \\nexample, for the modification discussed in paragraph b. of this appendix, the applicant should show that: \\n(1) The m odifications to the compressor cooling flow circuit do not improve the \\ncapability of the compressor case t o withstand the test conditions, and \\n(2) The increased cooling flow does not improve the capability to withstand the rigors \\nof the test for the hot section parts that are pressurized or cooled by this flow.  The reconciliation for any such modified parts  (i.e. non- type design) should be included in the reconciliation section \\nof the test plan. \\nd. The modifications to the test engine configuration should still allow the engine to \\nsubstantially conform to the final type design.  In addition, the test engine, as modified, should be representative of the durability and capability of a typical type design engine to withstand the \\nrigors of the test. \\nA4-2\\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nAppendix 5.  Endurance Test Conformity Inspections and Type Inspection Authorization \\n1. The calibration and endurance test engine(s) must substantially conform to the final type \\ndesign configuration, except for non- type design hardware approved by us .  The applicant should \\nmake all inspections necessary to determine that the parts and components of the engine \\nadequately conform to the drawings and specifications of the type design, and t he engine is built \\nto the assembly procedures specified in the type design .  Our  manufacturing inspectors or an \\nFAA designee will conduct pre- and post- test c onformity inspections.  The applicant should also \\ndisclose any deviations (referred to as “nonconformances”) of hardware, software, and components from the type design, and should provide acceptable evidence that these non- type \\ndesign characteristics will not adversely affect the outcome or the integrity of the test.  Finally, \\nthe applicant  should report the data generated in pretest conformity inspections to us for our \\nreview .  For reporting, the applicant should use the applicable reporting format .  Refer to FAA \\nOrder 8110.4C for the type certification procedures related to conformity inspections. \\n2. Certain test hardware should be subject to pre assembly conformity inspections by either our \\nmanufacturing inspector or the FAA -designated inspector.  The  inspectors should give particular \\nattention to critical characteristics of critical and major parts that are subject to significant \\ntemperatures, distortion, cracking, fatigue, creep, and wear.  This conformity inspection may vary, depending upon circumst ances , and is based on a conformity inspection plan.  Our pretest \\nreview of applicant\\'s quality control procedures, inspection personnel experience, and inspection \\nfacilities capability will help to determine the extent of the required conformity inspections prior \\nto the endurance test.  Refer to FAA O rder 8110.4C for conformity inspection requirements. \\n3. The type inspection authorization (TIA) is normally prepared by our certifying office upon \\nthe applicant’ s request, and is used to authorize conformity inspections to ensure that the test \\nengine hardware conforms to the approved type design for certification.  The TIA should identify the test engine configuration, including germane hardware for the test , the FAA -approved non-\\ntype design hardware, and the parts that are subject to preassembly inspection.  We may also \\nissue a TIA requiring special inspections on either the test engine or the test facilities when we find it necessary. For more information on the request for conformity inspection, TIA, statement \\nof conformity, t ype inspection report, and related instructions, see chapter 5 of FAA Order \\n8110.4C , Type Certification . \\n4. The following example shows hardware that is germane to a demonstration under § 33.87 \\nrequired by a redesigned annular combustor.  Assume the combustor redesign alters the actual \\ndischarge gas temperature profile relative to the gas temperature measured by the turbine temperature assembly. This factor then changes the operating envir onment of all parts that are \\naffected by a change in the gas temperature characteristics. The objective of the endurance test is to demonstrate that the core engine hardware affected by changes to the gas path environment will satisfactorily pass a 150 -hour endurance test at the maximum permissible gas temperature. \\nIn this example, the germane hardware is the: \\na.

The certification test reports should contain sufficient data (for example, plots, tabulations, \\nfigures, and photographs) and discussions to show that the engine successfully completed all \\nrequirements of the calibration test, endurance test, and teardown inspection.  In addition to tes t \\nresults and data analyses, the applicant  should include analyses of engine faults, significant \\nhardware deterioration , and corrective actions. \\n2.

Endurance Testing for a Two -Minute Transient Overtemperature Limit\\n \\nApproval\\n \\n1. Explanation. \\na. Two-minute gas transient overtemperature approval for engine acceleration (see \\n§ 33.87(a)(3)).  We previously approved a 2- minute gas transient overte mperature limit for \\nengine acceleration within the 5 -minute time limit associated with the thrust or power rating for \\nturbofan engines under § 33.7.  This 2-minute approval addresses a condition in which a gas \\ntemperature overshoot occurs subsequent to a large temperature excursion that causes a \\ndifference in the thermal growth rate of the engine cases and rotors and a decrease in engine \\ncycle efficiency.  This condition occurs most often when an engine is accelerated to takeoff from \\na cold state. \\n(1) For turbine engines installed on rotorcraft, the temperature excursion could be \\nsignificant because rotorcraft flight operations often accelerate the engine from a cold state. \\n(2) For turbine engines installed on large fixed-wing aircraft, we would not expect such \\ntemperature excursions to occur regularly during takeoff operation, due to the time spent from \\nengine start, through push back from the gate and taxi, to takeoff.  The fol lowing are examples of \\nflight conditions when the temperature overshoot may occur and the gas transient \\novertemperature limit could be used: \\n(a) Engine acceleration during first takeoff of the day. \\n(b) Engine acceleration from a cold soak low power condition. \\n(c) Engine acceleration from low Mach number during hot day conditions, such as \\ncertain corner points of the flight envelope or aircraft go-around operations. \\nb. Within the 5 -minute maximum steady -state gas temperature limit for the takeo ff thrust \\nor power rating, the applicant may propose a gas transient overtemperature time limit greater \\nthan 30 seconds and less than or equal to 2 minutes.  In reviewing § 33.87(a)(3), we determined that the phrase, “must be at least 100 percent of the va lue associated with the particular engine \\noperation being tested,” may be applied to cover the proposed gas transient overtemperature.  \\nHowever, since the transient overtemperature is part of the 5 -minute steady -state temperature \\nlimit, a deteriorated engi ne should be removed from an aircraft for maintenance whenever the \\nengine fails to produce rated takeoff thrust or power for either the transient overtemperature or \\nthe 5 -minute steady -state temperature limits, or both. \\n2.

For approval of gas transient overtemperature limits greater than 30 seconds and less \\nthan or equal to 2 minutes under § 33.87(a)(3), the applicant must demonstrate the proposed limit value and duration for all test periods at takeoff thrust or power condition in § 33.87.  This should include the running time of all 30-second periods at takeoff power or thrust in § 33.87, \\nA7-1\\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n     \\n \\n    \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n      \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nunless the exception allowance for gas temperature and oil inlet temperature under § 33.87(a)(7) applies.  Section 33.87(a)(7) requires t est runs at limiting temperature for any rated power or \\nthrust, except where the test periods are not longer than 5 minutes and do not allow stabilization.  For example, if an applicant proposes a 2- minute gas transient overtemperature limit as part of \\nthe 5- minute rated takeoff maximum permissible temperature limit, the following apply: \\n(1) For the test run under § 33.87(b), the applicant should demonstrate 6 hours and 35 \\nminutes out of the 18.75 hours of running time required by §§ 33.87(b)(1), (b)(2)( ii), and (b)(5), \\nat the 2 -minute transient overtemperature limit.

Endurance Test for Engine Certification and Showing of Compliance for\\n \\nEngineering Changes\\n \\n1. The endurance test is an essential part of all engine type certifications.  The test may also be \\nused to show compliance for engineering changes introduced by repairs and PMA applications.  We discuss acceptable means of compliance with § 33.87 for engine type certification and major \\ndesign changes in the following paragraphs. \\na. New t ype certificate .  Run the endurance test as prescribed in §§ 33.87(a) and 33.87(b) \\nthrough (g), as applicable , i.e., standard 150-hour endurance test, with no deviations. \\nb. Amended  type certificate . Run the endurance test as prescribed in § 33.87(a) and the \\napplicable endurance test cycle in §§ 33.87(b) through (g), with no deviations, unless one of the \\nfollowing conditions applies: \\n(1) The engine is a derivative model w ith minor or no design changes , and with the \\nsame or lower ratings and same or lower operating limitations, such that the original endurance \\ntest is still applicable. \\n(2) The engine is a derivative model with major design changes , and the same or lower \\nratings and operating limitations.  These changes, if viewed individually or in combination, \\nwould have no impact on engine operability or durability within the approved ratings and limitations.  Therefore, the data from the original endurance test would s how compliance for the \\nproposed hardware changes. \\n(3) The engine is a derivative model with major design changes , and the same or lower \\nratings and operating limitations, and for which we have determined that a repeat demonstration \\nof the endurance test  under §§ 33.87(b) through (g), as applicable, is needed to show compliance \\nfor the design change.  Applicants must comply with all subparagraphs of § 33.87(a).  We will determine: \\n1 Which subparagraphs of § 33.87(a) are affected by the proposed design \\nchanges , and require reevaluation by test, and \\n2 Which subparagraphs can be complied with by similarity using existing data \\nfrom a prior applicable test under § 33.87. \\n(4) The above exceptions are based on the assumption that the applicant has conducted \\na standard endurance test on the original model or subsequent derivative model, in compliance with the requirements of § 33.87, such that the approved data from that previous test would apply. \\nc. Supplemental type certificate (STC) and amended STC . The applicant should identify \\nthe effects of the major design change on the validity of the endurance test run during the engine type certification.  Compliance with all subparagraphs of § 33.87(a) is required.  Our certifying \\noffice will determine whic h subparagraphs of § 33.87(a) are affected by the proposed design \\nA8-1\\n \\n   \\n     \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nchanges  and require reevaluation by test .  The certifying office will also determine  which \\nsubparagraphs have existing data from a test completed under § 33.87 for which compliance \\nfindings by similarity can be made. When the major design change requires a repeat \\ndemonstration of § 33.87, the applicant should run the applicable endurance test cycle prescribed in §§ 33.87(b) through (g), with no deviations. \\nA8-2\\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n    \\n \\n       \\n \\n    \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n     \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n    \\n    \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nAppendix 9.  Rotorcraft Operation w ith O EI Ratings and Endurance Test \\n1. Endurance Test for 30 -second OEI and 2 -minute OEI Ratings. \\na. The maximum gross weight of a multi- engine rotorcraft is limited by the power \\navailable from the remaining operating engine(s) when one engine fails or is shutdown during flight. \\nb. In the event of an engine failure at the critical decision point (CDP) of an aircraft during \\ntakeoff or landing, a short burst of very high power, referred to as the 30-second OEI power, is required to complete the takeoff, or complete a rejected takeoff, or complete a balked landing.  This power level should enable the aircraft, at any point at or above CDP, to achieve continued flight, meet obstacle clearance requiremen ts, and gain forward speed for taking off.  At any point \\nat an airspeed/altitude up to CDP, this power level should also enable the aircraft to safely complete a rejected takeoff.  If the OEI condition occurs during landing, this high power level should be sufficient to lift the aircraft to a safe altitude, clear obstructions in the flight path, and \\ninitiate a climb out (balked landing). \\nc. A somewhat longer period  of 2 minutes and at a lower power level, but still higher than \\ntakeoff power, referred to a s 2-minute OEI power, is required to complete the climb out to a safe \\naltitude and obtain the desired forward airspeed. Once the aircraft has reached the desired safe altitude and airspeed, a longer period at a lower power (still equal to or higher than m aximum \\ncontinuous power) is required to continue flight until a suitable landing site is reached.  This power level will either be rated maximum continuous, 30-minute OEI, or continuous OEI power \\ndepending on the rating structure of the engine.  For these reasons, the engine rating structure for a rotorcraft having 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI is typically selected from one of the \\nfollowing three combinations of ratings: \\n(1) Maximum continuous, rated takeoff, and 30-second and 2- minute OEI . \\n(2) Maxi mum continuous, rated takeoff, 30-second and 2-minute OEI, and 30- minute \\nOEI. \\n(3) Maximum continuous, rated takeoff, 30-second and 2-minute OEI, and continuous \\nOEI. \\nd. For the endurance test, the test schedule is prescribed in § 33.87(f) for rotorcraf t engines \\nfor which 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings are desired.  The intent of this 2-hour test run is to assure that the engine is capable of producing these OEI rating powers in a deteriorated state.  Therefore, this is an add-on test conducted s eparately on the same engine hardware after \\ncompletion of a 150-hour endurance test under §§ 33.87(b), (c), (d), or (e). \\n2. Endurance Test for 2½ -minute OEI Rating . \\na. The 2½-minute OEI rating power is intended for the engine to perform similar functions \\nas 30-second OEI and 2-minute OEI ratings in an OEI flight condition for a rotorcraft, but at a \\nA9-1\\n \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n      \\n  \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n      \\n \\n  \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\ngenerally lower power level relative to these two ratings.  Similarly, th e engine rating structure \\nfor a rotorcraft having 2½ -minute OEI is typically selected from one of the following \\ncombinations of ratings: \\n(1) Maximum continuous, rated takeoff, and 2½- minute OEI . \\n(2) Maximum continuous, rated takeoff, 2½-minute OEI, and 30- minute OEI . \\n(3) Maximum continuous, rated takeoff, 2½-minute OEI, and continuous OEI. \\nb. The endurance test prescribed in § 33.87(e) applies to the above rating structures. \\n3. The D ifference B etween the OEI Ratings. \\na. In rotorcraft operation, 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings perform very similar \\nfunctions as 2½- minute OEI ratings.  The significant difference between them is the limited use \\nin service with mandatory inspection and maintenance actions for 30-second OEI and 2- minute \\nOEI power rating s use. These two higher power ratings are intended to safely use available \\nengine design margin for brief periods of exposure that may result in engine part or component deterioration beyond serviceable limits and , therefore , possibly be unavailable for further use. \\nb. The purpose of mandatory maintenance action is to restore the safety margin of the \\nengine back to the level required in the airworthiness standards of part 33.  Additionally, the teardown inspection standards differ as follows: \\n(1) The requirement for teardown inspection for a 2½- minute OEI rating after an \\nendurance test under § 33.93(a) is that each engine part must be eligible for incorporation into an \\nengine for continued operation in accordance with information submitted in complia nce with \\n§ 33.4. \\n(2) The requirements for teardown inspection for 30-second and 2- minute OEI ratings \\nunder § 33.93(b) are that each engine part may exhibit deterioration in excess of that permitted under § 33.4, including some engine parts or components that may be unsuitable for further use, provided the structural integrity of the engine is maintained. \\nA9-2\\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n    \\n   \\n \\n    \\n      \\n     \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n  \\n      \\n     \\n  \\n         \\n \\n         \\n \\n         \\n \\n    \\n    \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\nAppendix 10.  Accumulated Endurance Testing Times for § 33.87(e) \\n1. The endurance tests under § 33.87(e) for a 2½-minute OEI rating should be run in one of the \\nfollowing three combinations of ratings, as described in the “Guidance” section of § 33.87(e). \\n(a) Rated takeoff, maximu m continuous, and 2½- minute OEI,  or \\n(b) Rated takeoff, maximum continuous, 2½-minute OEI, and 30- minute OEI, or \\n(c) Rated takeoff, maximum continuous, 2½-minute OEI, and continuous OEI. \\n2.

The FAA ’s manufacturing inspector , project engineer, or authorized designees should \\nwitness the teardown inspection.  Refer to O rder 8110.4C paragraph 5-14 for the teardown \\ninspection requirements.  The teardown inspection consists of two parts—a dirty and a clean \\ninspection.  Applicants should conduct the dirty inspection at part level, partial assembly, subassembly, or assembly , witho ut prior cleaning. The degree of disassembly largely depends \\non the findings of the engine and components before, during, or after disassembly. \\n2. Tear down inspection requirements . \\na. Dirty inspection . At a minimum, the applicant should note the items listed below , and \\nour manufacturing inspector should verify that the appearance of subassemblies  and parts during \\nthe teardown is carefully noted. \\n(1) Component’ s adjustment setting and functioning characteristic s not within the \\nlimits established and recorded at the beginning of the endurance test ; \\n(2) Any abnormal indication of leaks in valves, seals, or fittings ; \\n(3) Indications of excessive or lack of lubrication; \\n(4) Excessive coking ; \\n(5) Metal or foreign particles in the oil screens or passages ; \\n(6) Sticking or broken parts ; \\n(7) Lack of freedom of moving parts; \\n(8) Excessive breakaway torques ; and \\n(9) Any other condition that may not be noticeable after complete disassembly and \\ncleaning. \\nb. Clean inspection . \\n(1) Visual inspection.  Thoroughly clean all engine parts a nd subassemblies. \\n(a) Visually inspect all engine parts for indications of galling, metallic pickup, \\ncorrosion, distortion, interference between moving parts, and cracks ; \\n(b) Check parts for discoloration that may be due to excessive heat or lack of \\nlubrication ; \\n(c) Give special attention to bearings, gears, seals , or other rotating parts ; and \\nA11-1 \\n   \\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n      \\n  \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n  \\n  \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(d) Inspect hot section parts for indications of cracking, overheating, or burning. \\n(2) Nondestructive inspection.

Historical Background f or the Calibration Tests, Endurance Test s, and \\nTeardown Inspection Requirements\\n \\n1. General . \\na. The basic requirements under § 33.87 regarding test cycles and testing at maximum \\nthrust, power, torque, redline rotor s peeds, and engine turbine gas temperatures have remained \\nsubstantially the same  since their introduction in 1958 and through amendment 2 of part 13 of \\nthe Civil Air Regulation ( CAR ), despite several regulatory reviews.  These endurance test \\nrequirements constitute an inseparable part of the engine durability and operability certification \\nprocess in part 33 that has provided an acceptable level of safety for aircraft gas turbine engines for more than five decades. \\nb. The endurance test cycle was not designed to represent a typical in -service flight cycle. \\nInstead, it represents an accelerated demonstration of durability, operability, and reliability with \\nthe engine operating at the power, thrust or torque, rotor speeds, and gas temperature limits for \\nwhich it will be certificated. \\n2. Civil Air Regulation (CAR) 14 CFR part 13— Aircraft Engine Airworthiness . \\na. CAR part 13, effective March 5, 1952. The Civil Aeronautics Board adopted a revised \\nCAR part 13, on January 28, 1952.  The Board promulgated the previously effective CAR part \\n13 in 1941.  Part 13 remained substantially unchanged until 1952, and represented the first time turbine- type engine certification rules were included in the regulations.  The Board designated \\ngeneral block tests, calibration tests, and a 150- hour endurance test for turbine engines as \\n§§ 13.250, 252 and 254, respectively, in part 13.  The technical content of the calibration test was similar to Federal Aviation Regulation (FAR) 14 CFR part 33.85(a), except that the CAR part 13 did not address compressor air bleed for the test.  The CAR part 13 endurance test consisted of \\n30 run periods of 5 hours each, as specified by the test schedule.  This endurance test resembled \\ntoday’s FAR part 33.87(b)(1), but it used 91 percent takeoff, and 90 and 75 percent maximum continuous power or thrust test runs instead of §§ 33.87(b)(2) through 33.87(b)(4).  Sections \\n33.87(b)(2) through 33.87(b)(4) today specify the testing at maximum continuous, takeoff, and incremental cruise power or thrust.  The CAR part 13 teardown inspection under § 13.256 required a complete engine disassembly and detailed inspection of the tested engine to check for fatigue and wear. \\nb. CAR part 13, amendment 13-1, effective August 12, 1957. \\n(1) This amendment revised two subparagraphs in the endurance test schedule from \\n“91 percent takeoff” and “90 percent and 75 percent maximum continuous power/thrust” to \\n“Takeoff and idling” and “Incremental cruise power and/or thrust,” respectively, which made these two essentially the same as the FAR § § 33.87(b)(2) and 33.87(b)(4). \\n(2) Other revisions were: \\nA12-1\\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n    \\n    \\n   \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n \\n   \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n           \\n      \\n     \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(a) The addition of a requirement that during the endurance test, the engine \\npower/thrust and rotational speeds be controlled within +/- 3 percent of the specified value. \\n(b) The addition of test requirements for engines with an augmented power or \\nthrust rating . \\n(c) The addition of maximum gas temperature and oil temperature requirements at \\nall engine rating runs during the test, which is same as the equivalent requirements in \\n§ 33.87(a)(7). \\nc. CAR p art 13, amendment 13-2, effective May 17, 1958. This amendment revised the \\nspecification of power and/or thrust and of engine rotational speed of a tolerance in the endurance test from “+/ - 3 percent of the specified values” to “at not less than 100 percent of the \\nspecified values.” \\nd. CAR part 13, amendment 13-5, effective February 12, 1963. This amendment revised \\npart 13 by defining and adding a new rating, “30-minute power for helicopter turbine engines,” and adding a new test schedule to § 13.254, Endurance test, for substantiating this rated power for turbine engines used in rotorcraft.  The technical content of this new schedule is essentially the same as the FAR part 33.87(c), “Rotorcraft engines for which a 30- minute OEI power rating \\nis desired.” \\ne. CAR p art 13, amendment 13- 6, effective Ap ril 22, 1964. This amendment established a \\n2½-minute power rating for a one engine inoperative (OEI) event at any instant after the start of takeoff for multi -engine rotorcraft.  This was accomplished by defining and adding a new rating, \\n“2½-minute power for helicopter turbine engines,” and adding a new test schedule to § 13.254(c) \\nfor an engine with a “2½ -minute power” and a “30 -minute power” to substantiate these rated \\npowers.  The test requirements for these ratings are essentially the same as § 33.87(e), except: \\n(1) Section 33.87(e)(2) allows three OEI rating combinations for rotorcraft \\nperformance needs , while the CAR § 13.254(c) allowed only the following option (b).  The \\noptions allowed by FAR § 33.87(e)(2) are: \\n(a) 2½-minute OEI/maximum continuous, \\n(b) 2½-minute OEI/30 -minute OEI, and \\n(c) 2½-minute OEI/continuous OEI ratings. \\n(2) Section 33.87(e)(2) requires that the last 5 minutes of the 30-minute OEI in one of \\nthe endurance test cycles be run to 2½ -minute OEI power , while the CAR § 13.254(c) does not. \\nNote:   Section 13.250, General block tests, § 13.252, Calibration \\ntest, and § 13.256, Teardown inspections remained unchanged through amendment 13- 6. \\nA12-2 \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n   \\n  \\n   \\n \\n     \\n  \\n      \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n     \\n \\n  \\n       \\n \\n  \\n      \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n      \\n      \\n \\n          \\n  \\n      \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n3. 14 CFR, part 33 – Airworthiness Standards: Aircraft Engines . \\na. Part 33, effective February 1, 1965. \\n(1) The new 14 CFR part 33 of the FAA recodification program was issued to replace \\nthe airworthiness requirements contained in part 13 of the CAR. \\n(2) Section 33.85, Calibration tests, is the same as its equivalent paragraph in the CAR \\npart 13, except for an additional requirement that the engine power control be adjusted to \\nproduce the maximum allowable gas temperatures and rotor speeds at takeoff operating \\nconditions before the endurance test, and may not be changed during calibration tests and the endurance test. \\n(3) The contents of §§ 33.87, Endurance test and 33.93, Teardown inspections are the \\nsame as their equivalent paragraphs in the CAR part 13, except for minor editorial differences. \\n(4) Section 33.99, General conduct of block tests was completely revised from its \\nequivalent paragraph in the CAR part 13. \\nb. Part 33, amendment 6, effective October 31, 1974. \\n(1) The new § 33.82, General, adopted by this amendment, requires the applicant to \\nestablish and record certain adjustment settings and functioning characteristics of engine \\ncomponents before starting the endurance test.  This paragraph is the same in the current \\nregulations. \\n(2) Section 33.85(a) of the calibration test was revised to include only the compressor \\nair bleed essential for engine functioning during the test.  Section 33.85(b) was revised to the current regulation.  Both paragraphs now agree with the current regulation. \\n(3) Section 33.87, Endurance test, was revised in response to the increasing complexity \\nof airframes, engines, and their interfaces.  This amendment added § 33.87(a)(3) to address the \\nallowance for multiple engine tests when all engine parameters could not be held simultaneously at the 100 percent level that was to be certified. We made this change based on our certification experience with high -bypass large turbofan engine certifications.   Section 33.87 was revised by: \\n(a) Expanding § 33.87(a) to the current requirements, except: \\n1The test may be run at reduced power or thrust or rotor speeds below the 100 \\npercent value specified in § 33.87(a)(3) during maximum air bleed runs, and \\n2The testing of accessory drives and mounting attachments may be \\naccomplished on a rig in § 33.87(a)(6). \\n(b) Including the endurance test schedule for supersonic aircraft engine. \\nA12-3 \\n   \\n \\n   \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n  \\n \\n   \\n      \\n \\n       \\n     \\n  \\n \\n       \\n \\n    \\n      \\n \\n   \\n \\n      \\n \\n    \\n     \\n     \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(4) Section 33.93(a), Teardown inspection, was revised to the current requirements. \\n(5) Section 33.99, General conduct of block tests, was revised to the current regulation \\nby adding requirements for engine service, malfunction, and stoppage during endurance test. \\nc. Part 33, amendment 10, effective March 26, 1984. \\n(1) Section 33.87, Endurance test, was revised as follows: (a) Section s 33.87(a)(3) and (a) (5) were revised to allow the applicant to reduce \\npower or thrust or rotor speeds below the 100 percent value specified in § 33.87(a)(3) during \\nmaximum compressor air bleed runs, as it is not always possible to reach redline speeds at takeoff and maximum c ontinuous thrust/power without exceeding gas temperature limits. \\n(b) Section 33.87(a)(6) was revised to allow separate rig testing of accessory \\ndrives and mounting attachments. \\n(c) A new requirement was added to specify that the rated 2½ -minute OEI  power \\nmust be applied during the last 25\\nth cycle of the endurance test. Specifically, the 2½- minute OEI \\npower must be applied during the last 5 minutes of the 30- minute  run for the rated 30 -minute \\nOEI. \\n(d) The above changes updated §§ 33.87(a)(3), (a )(5), and (a)(6) to the current \\nrequirements. \\nd. Part 33, amendment 12, effective October 3, 1988. \\n(1) In § 1.1, t he existing definitions of “2½-minute power” and “30- minute power” \\nwere revised to read:   “2½-minute OEI power” and “30-minute OEI power” to make these \\ndefinitions relate more closely to the name of these power ratings with their intended use.  A new \\ndefinition of “continuous OEI power” was introduced. \\n(2) In § 33.87, the new test schedule for an engine with a “continuous OEI power” \\nrating was added to the endurance test as § 33.87(d). \\ne. Part 33, amendment 18, effective August 19, 1996. \\n(1) This amendment adopted new 30- second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings applicable \\nto rotorcraft turbine engines. \\n(2) New definitions of, “30-second OEI power” and “2-minute OEI power” ratings \\nwere introduced in § 1.1. \\n(3) Section 33.85 was revised by adding new paragraphs (c) and (d) to cover specific \\ncalibration test requirements for these two OEI ratings. \\nA12-4 \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n    \\n \\n    \\n \\n       \\n    \\n  \\n   \\n     \\n  \\n  \\n \\n      \\n \\n \\n      \\n     \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n          \\n \\n  \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n 03/09/15 AC 33.87-1A\\n \\n(4) Section 33.87 was revise d by adding a new 2 -hour test schedule to paragraph (f) for \\nthe ratings. \\n(5) Section 33.93 was revised by adding new paragraphs (b) and (c) that define \\nteardown inspection requirements after completion of the 2-hour endurance test in § 33.87(f). \\nf. Part 33, amendment 25, effective October 17, 2008. This change amended the \\nendurance test and tear down inspection requirements for certain OEI ratings.  This amendment was the result of a harmonization effort of a working group comprised of representatives of the \\nFAA, the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), Transport Canada, and industry.  The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) subsequently adopted these new requirements as part of its Certification Specifications for Engines. \\n(1) Revised § 1.1, General definitions, for all rated OEI powers by adding a second \\ncondition, an engine shutdown, to the failure condition that defines an OEI. Also revised the use \\nfor the 2½- minute OEI rating from “ a peri od of use” to “periods of use” to be consistent with the \\nusage definitions of 30-second OEI and 2- minute OEI ratings . \\n(2) Revised § 33.87(a)(6) to allow the applicant to run the tests under §§ 33.87(f)(1) \\nthrough (f)(8) without loading the accessory drives and mounting attachments if the applicant can substan tiate that the durability of any accessory drive or engine component is not \\nsignificantly affected  and if the equivalent power is added to the output drive shaft. \\n(3) Revised § 33.87(a)(5) to exempt engines with 30-second and 2- minute OEI ratings \\nfrom t esting with maximum air bleed if the applicant can show by testing, or analysis based on \\ntesting, that the validity of the endurance test is preserved. \\n(4) Added a requirement that the test schedule for 30 -second and 2- minute OEI ratings \\nin § 33.87(f) be run continuously without stopping. \\n(5) Clarified the test schedule in § 33.87(f)(4) related to 30-second and 2- minute OEI \\nratings. \\n(6) Revised the test schedule in § 33.87(c) related to 30- minute OEI rating to agree \\nwith the schedule in EASA’s certification specifications for engines.  The result harmonizes the endurance test schedule for engines with a 30- minute OEI rating. \\n(7) Clarified the idle condition of § 33.87(f)(8) as flight idle. \\n(8) Revised § 33.93(b)(2) by replacing the parts or co mponents identified as , “mounts, \\ncases, bearing supports, shafts, and rotors, ” with , “the engine,” to emphasize that after the test, \\nthe applicant needs to inspect and consider deterioration of any engine component that could affect the structural integrity of the engine, not just those listed above. \\ng.

Purpose.  \\n \\n a. This advisory circular (AC) provides information and guidance on developing the \\ntechnical data needed for major repairs of critical and complex turbine engine parts.  This \\nguidance will help persons developing major repair data meet the requirements of Title 14 of the \\nCode of Federal Regulations (14 CFR ) part 43 to restore the engine to at least equal to its \\noriginal or properly altered condition.  This does not mean that a repaired part must be returned \\nto a factory -new conditio n.  However, the engine on which the repaired part is installed must \\nremain airworthy and in compliance with the applicable regulat ions.  For repairs of turbine \\nengines and parts, the applicable requirements are Airworthiness Standards: Aircraft Engines (14 \\nCFR part 33) and Fuel Venting and Exhaust Emissions Requirements for Turbine Engine \\nPowered Airplanes  (14 CFR part 34) . \\n \\n b. Additionally, this AC provides guidance to assist persons developing major repair s with \\ndeveloping a continued operational safety  plan.  It also helps them evaluate  engine parts \\nrecovered from accidents and incidents  prior to making a repair . \\n \\n2. Applicability.  \\n \\n a. This AC provides guidance to all persons developing the technical data to substantiate \\nmajor repairs for critical or c omplex turbine engine parts, including type certificate (TC) and \\nsupplemental type certificate (STC) holders.  \\n \\n b. This guidance is neither mandatory nor regulatory in nature and does not constitute a \\nregulation.  It describes acceptable means, but not the  only means, for demonstrating compliance \\nwith the applicable regulations.  The FAA (“we”) will consider other methods of demonstrating \\ncompliance that a person developing repair data may elect to present.  Terms such as “should,” \\n“shall,” “may,” and “must ” are used only in the sense of ensuring applicability of this particular \\nmethod of compliance when the acceptable method of compliance in this document is used.  \\nWhile these guidelines are not mandatory, they are derived from extensive FAA and industry \\nexperience in determining compliance with the applicable regulations.  On the other hand, if we \\nbecome aware of circumstances that convince us that following this AC would not result in \\n\\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n2 compliance with the applicable regulations, we will not be bound by the terms of this AC, and \\nwe may require additional substantiation as the basis for finding compliance . \\n \\n c. This document does not change, create any additional, authorize changes in, or permit \\ndeviations from, existing regulatory requirements.  \\n \\n3. Related Re ferences.

The designs of many critical and complex turbine engine parts , hereafter referred to as \\n“parts ,” require the use of advanced design  and test methodologies , comprehensive materials \\ndata, and refined manufacturing techniques to achieve high levels of safety, reliability and \\nperformance.  A person developing a repair for a critical or complex part should have a thorough \\nunderstanding of the part ’s design characteristics, operational environments, operating \\nrequirements, and failure modes and effects .  This knowledge  is useful for determin ing if a repair \\nto a part is major and for develop ing the appropriate technical data for FAA approval.    \\n \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n3  b. Our previous evaluations of major repair data packages for critical and complex parts \\nhave indicated that the data were not always adequate to support substantiation of the repair.  \\nData developed for major repairs of critical or complex parts may typicall y include rigorous \\nanalyses and tests to show the engine on which the repaired part is installed will be at least equal \\nto its original or properly altered condition.  An original or properly altered condition is an \\nairworthy condition that existed before the need for the proposed repair.  An airworthy condition \\nmeans the aircraft conforms to its type certificate and is in a condition for safe operation.  \\n \\n c. This AC uses part categorization as an aid for persons to determine whether a part being \\nrepaired i s a critical or complex part.  In addition, this AC recommends certain information be \\nincluded in major repair data packages to improve consistency and completeness.  In Appendix 2 \\nof this AC, we also provide templates for repairs related to various  engine  part families  to assist \\nrepair developers in identifying the technical elements and regulatory requirements when \\ndeveloping and substantiating similar repairs,  if determined major.  \\n \\n5. Part Categorization .  This AC categorizes parts based on their most s evere potential failure \\neffect using various methods for assessing malfunctions and failure modes.  To assess \\nmalfunctions and failure modes, repair developers may use the failure modes and effects \\nassessment described in Appendix 1 of this AC or other acc eptable analytic techniques.  Refer to \\nAC 33.75 -1A for examples of other acceptable techniques.     \\n \\n a. Part Categories .  The categories used in this AC are consistent with categories found in \\nOrder 8120.2 and AC 39 -8, and used in AC 43 -18.  The part cate gories are:   \\n \\n  (1) Category 1.  A product, i.e. engine, or part(s) thereof, whose failure could prevent \\ncontinued safe flight and landing; resulting consequences could reduce safety margins, degrade \\nperformance, or cause loss of capability to conduct cert ain flight operations.  A Category 1 part, \\nfor the purpose of this AC and Orders 8110.37 and 8110.4, is a critical part.   \\n \\n  (2) Category 2.  An engine or part(s) thereof whose failure would not prevent \\ncontinued safe flight and landing; resulting consequ ences may reduce the capability of the \\naircraft or the ability of the crew to cope with adverse operating conditions or subsequent \\nfailures.  For the purpose of this AC and Order 8110.4, a Category 2 part is typically a complex \\npart that may affect a criti cal part.  \\n \\n  (3) Category 3.  An engine or part(s) thereof whose failure would have no effect on \\ncontinued safe flight and landing of the aircraft.  The only consequence would be partial or \\ncomplete loss of engine thrust or power (and associated engine ser vices).  For single engine \\napplications, consider changing part categorization to Category 1 or 2 if complete loss of thrust \\ncould prevent continued safe flight and landing or reduce the ability of the crew to cope with \\nadverse operating conditions or subs equent failures.  \\n \\n b. Tables of Potential Failure Effects .  The following tables provide some potential failure \\neffects for Categories 1 and 2.  We also listed a few examples of parts whose malfunction or \\nfailure could result in one or more of the listed potential failure effects.  \\n \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n4 Table 1 .  Category 1 Engine Parts  \\n \\nPotential Failure Effects  Part Examples  \\n \\n(1) Non -containment of high-\\nenergy debris.  \\n \\n(2) Concentration of toxic \\nproducts in the engine bleed air \\nintended for the cabin, and \\nsufficient to inc apacitate crew or \\npassengers.  \\n \\n(3) Significant thrust in the \\nopposite direction to that \\ncommanded by the pilot.  \\n \\n(4) Uncontrolled fire.  \\n \\n(5) Failure of the engine mount \\nsystem leading to inadvertent \\nengine separation.  \\n \\n(6) Release of the propeller by the \\nengine, if applicable.  \\n \\n(7) Complete inability to shut the \\nengine down.   \\nLife-limited parts  \\n \\nMain engine mounts, with no redundant load \\ncarrying features  \\n \\nHigh pressure vessels (for example, casings \\nsubject to compressor discharge pressure and \\ncombustor pre ssure)  \\n \\nContainment structures  \\n \\nFan blades  \\n \\nFuel system shut -off \\n \\nPrimary structures (for example, structures that \\nprovide support and rigidity of the main engine \\nbackbone and for attachment of engine to \\nairframe)  \\n \\nThrust reverser control component if thru st \\nreverser control component is part of the engine \\ntype certificate.  \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n5 Table 2 .  Category 2 Engine Parts  \\n \\nPotential Failure Effects  Part Examples  \\n \\n(1) Controlled fires (that is, those brought under \\ncontrol by shutting down the engine or by onboard \\nexting uishing systems).  \\n \\n(2) Case burn -through where it can be shown there is \\nno propagation to hazardous engine effects.  \\n \\n(3) Release of low -energy parts where it can be shown \\nthere is no propagation to hazardous engine effects.  \\n \\n(4) Vibration levels that resul t in crew discomfort.  \\n \\n(5) Concentration of toxic products in the engine bleed \\nair for the cabin sufficient to degrade crew \\nperformance.  \\n \\n(6) Thrust in the opposite direction to that commanded \\nby the pilot, below the level defined as hazardous.  \\n \\n(7) Loss o f integrity of the load path of the engine \\nsupporting system without actual engine separation.  \\n \\n(8) Generation of thrust greater than maximum rated \\nthrust.  \\n \\n(9) Significant uncontrollable thrust oscillation.  \\n \\n(10) Loss of protection such as loss of overspe ed \\nprotection or loss of containment case capability.  \\n \\n(11) Effect or influence on a Category 1 part.   \\nRotating parts that are not life -limited  \\n (for example, compressor and turbine \\nairfoils)  \\n \\nAccessory gearbox and internal \\ncomponents  \\n \\nEngine bearings  \\n \\nSpinners  \\n \\nMain engine mounts with redundant load \\ncarrying features  \\n \\nStatic gas path parts (for example, vanes \\nand seals)  \\n \\nControl system actuators  \\n \\nCombustion liners  \\n \\nFuel nozzles  \\n \\n \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n6 6. Developing Data for Major Repairs .  To improve the quality and adequacy of data for \\nmajor repairs of critical (Category 1) and complex (Category 2) parts, we recommend persons \\ndeveloping the major repair data include the following information in their repair data packages:  \\n \\n a. A description of:  \\n \\n  (1) The part to be repaired,  including the part number.  \\n \\n  (2) The repair, including any associated limitations.  For example:  \\n \\n    • The extent of the damage the repair covers.  \\n    • How many times, if limited, the repair can be repeated on a single part.  \\n \\n b. The part categorizatio n, if categorization is used.  \\n \\n c. The applicable sections of the regulatory requirements from the certification basis for \\nthe engine(s) that the repaired part is eligible for installation on.  \\n \\n d. An applicability assessment of any related service diffic ulty reports and airworthiness \\ndirectives  (ADs) to the part .   \\n \\n e. The complete step -by-step “how to” instructions for accomplishing the repair.  This \\nshould include drawings and specifications, new materials and fabrication details, if any.   \\n \\n f. Techni cal data. The regulations require that when performing a major repair , the work \\nbe done in accordance with technical data approved by the Administrator.  Technical data also \\nincludes substantiation data to show compliance to applicable regulatory requireme nts. \\n \\n  (1) Category 1 parts .  We recommend that persons developing data in support of a \\nmajor repair of a Category 1 part meet with the project aircraft certification office ( PACO ) to \\ndevelop a substantiation plan  before submitting a data package.  The pl an should outline the \\npertinent technical and regulatory requirements and testing, as needed to develop the data and \\nsubstantiate the repair.   In addition, the plan should identify process controls , inspections or tests, \\nor both, required in  the step -by-step procedures  to mitigate the risks of improperly completing \\nthe repair.  \\n \\nNote: For major repairs of Category 1 parts, Order 8110.37, Designated \\nEngineering Representative (DER) Handbook, requires DERs notify the PACO  \\nprior to approval of the data.   Order 8110.4, Type Certification, requires PACO \\nengineers notify the accountable directorate  of a major repair of a Category 1 part  \\nand coordinate data approval with the certificate management ACO.  \\n \\n  (2) Category 2 parts.  We recommend persons developing data in  support of a major \\nrepair of a Category 2 part use the templates in Appendix 2 of this AC or develop a new \\ntemplate, if applicable.  \\n \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n7    (a) Together with industry we developed the sample templates in Appendix 2 for \\ntypical repairs that were previously det ermined major.  These templates may be used as aids to \\nidentify technical elements and regulatory requirements to be considered when developing your \\ndata and substantiating your repair for similar repairs to Category 2 parts, if determined major.  \\nThese te mplates are not all inclusive; rather, they are for a limited number of typical Category 2 \\nparts.  \\n \\n   (b) Persons using these templates should discuss any questions with the PACO.  If \\na template is not available for a proposed major repair, consider devel oping a new template. \\nUsing a format consistent with the templates provided will help ensure that your template \\nidentifies the applicable technical considerations and regulatory requirements.  You should \\nreview the new template with the PACO early in the p roject to determine if any additional data \\nwill be needed.  \\n \\n g. An assessment of the applicability of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness \\n(ICAs).  If ICAs are affected or needed, supplemental ICAs  must be provided .  Refer to FAA \\nOrder 8110.54 , Instruction for Continued Airworthiness Responsibilities, Requirements , and \\nContents, for further information .    \\n \\n7. Developing a Continued Operational Safety (COS) P lan.  \\n \\n a. COS Management Plan .  Repair approval holders and persons making a major repair \\nmust perform their work in accordance with approved technical data and applicable performance \\nregulations.  If service experience or FAA oversight audits show the repair data was inadequate, \\nin error, or the work was performed improperly, the FAA will evalu ate the safety impact and \\ntake appropriate action .  That action may be to issue an AD, Special Airworthiness Information \\nBulletin ( SAIB ), or other appropriate document.  In such a case, the repair  approval holder or the \\nperson who performed the work, or bo th, may be requested to develop a corrective action \\nprogram or a design change to restore safety to an acceptable level.  Therefore, the FAA \\nrecommends that repair approval holders who develop data for major repairs and persons who \\nuse that data to perform  maintenance develop a COS management plan.  \\n \\n b. Part Identification .  To facilitate part tracking as part of a COS management plan, we \\nrecommend that persons proposing a repair provide supplementary part identification \\nprocedures.   \\n \\n  (1) Any original pa rt markings, such as the part number and serial number, should be \\nmaintained.  Supplementary identification should be permanent and legible.  It should include a \\nname, trademark, or other symbol of the person performing the repair.  Supplementary \\nidentific ation combined with adequate maintenance records ensures that if a problem occurs the \\naffected parts can be identified, tracked, and, if necessary, removed from service.  \\n \\n  (2) Parts subject to an airworthiness limitation should retain their original mark ings in \\naccordance with § 45.14.  When adding supplementary identification to the part, repair \\ndevelopers must ensure that their repair identification does not adversely impact the part.  For \\nexample, do not apply repair identification on contact surfaces or near radii of parts because \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n8 these are typically areas of high stress concentrations.  When impractical, i.e., the part is too \\nsmall or applying the repair identification would compromise part integrity, we recommend \\nentering part identification informat ion in the part’s maintenance records.  \\n \\n c. Maintaining Records .  Federal Aviation Regulations have specific minimum time \\nrequirements for the retention of certain maintenance records.  Experience has shown that the \\nmaintenance records and the availability  of repair data can be extremely valuable for accident \\ninvestigation and corrective action development.  Therefore, we recommend that the data \\napproval holder and persons performing the major repairs, for example, repair stations, \\nowner/operators, or air c arriers, keep records that include at least the following:  \\n \\n  (1) A record keeping plan to:  \\n \\n   (a) Identify where repaired parts are in service or who the customer \\nowners/operators of the parts are.  \\n \\n   (b) Retain records of the work performed during th e repair .  \\n    \\n   (c) Retain the technical data for the parts.  \\n \\n  (2) Documentation of the quality control of the repair.  \\n \\n  (3) A means to monitor the performance of repaired parts in service.  \\n \\n  (4) A means to identify and isolate parts that do not confo rm to approved data or are \\nunairworthy.  \\n \\n  (5) The capability to analyze failed parts and identify root causes of failures in order to \\ndevelop and implement corrective action(s) when needed.  \\n \\n8. Repair of Engine  Parts Recovered from Accidents or Incidents .   \\n \\n a. We recommend p ersons repairing parts recovered from accidents or incidents inspect \\nthese parts for hidden damage  prior to beginning a repair.   Repair stations are required to \\nperform this inspection per regulation , refer to § 145.211(c) .  This pre -repair inspection  will \\nensure the part does not have hidden damage or has not been overstressed or overheated, which \\nis not always obvious from visual or dimensional inspection.   \\n \\n b. The ICAs may be insufficient for this pre -repair inspection .  Therefor e, developing \\nspecial instructions for evaluating repa irability of such parts may be appropriate .  We suggest \\nrepair developers review t he part’s maintenance and operational records for relevant service \\ninformation  and verify the history and origin of the parts when making that determination.  Parts \\nthat are determined to be unsuitable for repair should not be repaired and should be returned to \\nthe owner with the appropriate entry in the part maintenance record .  Refer to AC 20 -62 and \\nOrder 8120.11 for furt her information on the airworthiness and eligibility  of such parts.  Parts \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n9 otherwise eligible for repair which do not exhibit evidence of irreparable damage may be \\nrepaired.  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nFrancis A.

A failure modes and effects assessment is a qualitative process, independent of failure rates \\nand probabilities, by which each failure mode of a part in the engine system is analyzed.  S ome \\ntop-level functions typically considered in an engine failure modes and effects assessment are:  \\n \\n\\uf0b7 Maintaining structural integrity, including allowed overspeed and overtemperature \\nexceedances;  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing thrust or power;  \\n\\uf0b7 Operating in inclement weather;  \\n\\uf0b7 Providing customer bleed, power extraction, or both; and  \\n\\uf0b7 Meeting fuel consumption, exhaust gas temperature, vibration, emission or noise limits.  \\n  \\n2. Each system and subsystem of the engine is broken down into its basic functions using a \\nfunctional block di agram consistent with the Air Transport Association policy for identification \\nand definition of systems.   \\n \\n3. The functional block diagram defines each system and subsystem, and all their functions, in \\nthe turbine engine.  The experienced safety engineer performing the analysis determines the part -\\nto-part and part -to-system influences in both directions (input and output).  The process flow is \\nshown in figure A1.1 below:  \\n \\nFigure A1.1 .

The part cate gorization process is built around the fundamental understanding of the part \\nfunction and its potential effects on physically or functionally mating parts or both.   The \\nfundamental premise in the categorization process, and in the physical operation and fu nction of \\nthe turbine engine, is system interactions.  \\n \\n a. System interactions are influences a part, or a set of parts, can have on the turbine \\nengine, propulsion system, or aircraft through form, fit, or function, where  \\n \\n  (1) Form is the shape, size, di mensions, and other physical measurable parameters that \\nuniquely characterize a part.   \\n \\n  (2) Fit is the ability of a part to interface or interconnect, physically and functionally, at \\nthe common boundaries with another part or system of the engine.   \\n \\n  (3) Function is the action(s) the part is designed to perform in the engine.  \\n \\n b. These influences may extend beyond the component being classified, may be direct or \\nindirect, and may develop immediately or over time. Characteristics of these influences i nclude:  \\n \\n  (1) Direct influences, which are form and fit.  These influences are based on physical \\ncontact or interface clearances between adjacent parts.  \\n \\n  (2) Indirect influences, which are functional in nature.  These influences are not based \\non physica l contact, but may be aerodynamic, thermal, or vibratory.  \\n \\n5. The interactions where the consequence of failure is the furthest from the cause are the most \\ndifficult to identify.  Many fundamental relationships in part interactions and subsequent system \\neffects exist.  Figure A1.2 below provides four examples.  \\n4/30/10  AC 33 -9 \\n Appendix 1  \\n12 Figure A1.2 .

SAMPLE TEMPLATES  \\n \\n1. Purpose .  This appendix includes templates for major repairs related to 17 engine part \\nfamilies , listed in Table A2 -1 below .  The FAA selected them based on typical repairs for \\ncomplex turbine engine parts submitted as major.  These templates will aid repair developers in \\nidentifying the technical elements and regulatory requirements they should con sider when \\ndeveloping and substantiating similar major repairs.   Persons developing data must ensure that \\nany additional technical criteria or regulatory requirements are met for their specific proposed \\nmajor repair.   \\n \\n2. Template Instructions.  Each temp late shows both shaded and un -shaded (clear) cells \\ncorresponding to the sample repair and its specific engineering, technical and regulatory \\nconsiderations.  Those cells that are generally applicable are un -shaded.  However, the repair \\ndeveloper must decid e if the cells need to be completed or not.  The templates identify the \\ncurrent part 33 regulations, Amendments 1 -20 inclusive, applicable to turbine engines  as an \\nexample .  When reviewing the associated regulatory considerations, the repair developer shou ld \\ndetermine applicability and identify the corresponding methods of compliance to be used to \\nprovide the supporting data.  \\n \\n a. The certification basis of the engine (s) on which the repaired part is eligible for \\ninstallation identifies the regulatory requirements that should be reviewed for applicability.  \\nApplicable regulations are those regulations that must be evaluated to determine that the engine \\nremains in compliance and airworthy with respect to the repair work performed .  For critical and \\ncomplex p arts, the repair developer  should determine which of the original compliance findings \\nto those applicable regulations could be affected by their proposed major repair .  To do this, you \\nmust understand how the part to be repaired functions in the engine ope rating environment , and \\nthe associated regulatory  requirements.  Repair developers  substantiate their repair  to these \\nrequirements , using acceptable methods, to show that the condition of the engine on  which the \\nrepaired part is installed  will be at least equal to its original or properly altered condition . \\n \\n b. Acceptable methods are identified as follows:   \\n \\n  (1) D - Documentation (for example, Instructions for Continued Airworthiness).  \\n \\n  (2) A - Analysis of relevant data.  \\n \\n  (3) I - Inspection (for exa mple, metallurgical examination, hardness testing , Non-\\ndestructive testing inspection ). \\n \\n  (4) R - Rig testing.  \\n \\n  (5) C - Component testing . \\n \\n  (6) E - Engine testing . \\n \\n4/30/10   AC 33 -9 \\n  Appendix 2  \\n14   (7) S - Similarity to previously FAA approved data.  Repair developers will need to \\nshow that the previously approved data is applicable to the new proposed repair, and to the \\nproduct type design if different than the type design for which the data was previously approved.  \\n \\n3. Sample  Templates.   If a template is not available for a partic ular major repair , the repair \\ndeveloper  can create or modify another as necessary.  \\n \\nTable A2 -1.

This AC \\npresents a damage tolerance approach that can be used to address inherent material anomalies in rotating life-limited engine parts made of titanium. This approach can be \\nintegrated with the existing life manageme nt process (safe-life). Section 33.70 and AC \\n33.70-1 define the safe-life a pproach and the basic damage  tolerance requirements, \\nwhile this AC is specific to titanium life-limited rotating parts. This approach does not replace the existing safe-life methodology but  supplements it by addressing risks not \\naddressed by the safe-life approach. The use of damage tolerance procedures specified in this AC is not intended to allow operation beyond the component manual limit set \\nusing the existing safe-life approach. The existing safe-life approach limits the useful rotor life to the minimum number of flight cycles needed to initiate a crack. Rotor failure modes, for which full containment of  high-energy debris can be demonstrated, \\nare excluded from the procedures outlined in this AC.  \\nMaterial and Manufacturing Anomalies. \\nService experience with gas turbine engines has demonstrated that material and \\nmanufacturing anomalies do occur. These anomalies can potentially degrade the \\nstructural integrity of high-energy rotors. Conventional rotor, life management methodology (safe-life method) is founded on the assumption that abnormal material \\nvariations and manufacturing conditions can be eliminated. Therefore, the methodology \\n1-3\\n \\n  \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n   _______________________ 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\ndoes not ex\\nplicitly address the occurrence of  such anomalies, although some level of \\ntolerance to anomalies is essentially built-in using design margins, as well as factory \\nand field inspections. \\n1.5.3 Safe-Life Methodology. \\nUnder nominal (anomaly-free) conditions , the safe-life methodology provides a \\nstructured process for the design and life ma nagement of high-energy rotors, assuring \\nstructural integrity throughout the life of the rotor. Undetectable material processing and \\nmanufacturing-induced anomalies represent a departure from the assumed nominal \\nconditions. To measure the extent of such  occurrences, the FAA requested that the \\nSociety of Automotive Engineers (SAE) convene several ad  hoc committees to \\ndocument the number of uncontained events. Th e statistics pertaining to uncontained \\nrotor events are reported in SAE committee reports AIR1537, AIR4003, and SP-1270. While no adverse trends we re identified during the 1984-1989 reporting period, the \\ncommittee expressed concern that the projected 5 percent increase in airline passenger traffic each year would lead to an increase in the number of aircraft accidents from uncontained rotor events. Uncontained rotor events have the potential to cause catastrophic aircra ft accidents. \\n1.5.4 Probabilistic Damage Tolerance Approach. \\nFollowing the Sioux City event in 1989\\n1, the gas turbine engine industry collaborated \\nwith the FAA to develop a probabilistic damage tolerance approach to address hard alpha melt anomalies in rotating life-limited parts made of titanium. The FAA later published a methodology in AC 33.14-1. With the release of AC 33.14-1, engine manufacturers can ensure future rotor parts will achieve a reduced event rate associated with the occurrence of hard alpha anoma lies. This methodology was based on the best \\ninformation available in 1996. \\n1.5.5 Titanium Melt Anoma lies Knowledge Base. \\nSubstantial progress has b een made in expanding the industry knowledge base \\nassociated with melt anomalies in titanium. Through the collective efforts of engine manufacturers, melters, and forgers, there ha s been a significant improvement in the \\ncleanliness of cast and wrought  titanium rotor grade materials. In addition, FAA-funded \\nresearch and development work performed th rough programs such as the Turbine Rotor \\nMaterial Design at Southwest Research Institute has led to a deeper understanding of the fundamental material char acteristics of hard alpha. Th is effort has led to the \\ndevelopment and widespread availability of risk prediction design tools, enhanced inspection methods for billets and forgings , and an improved understanding and range \\nof inspection capabilities. \\n1 NTSB Aircraft Accident Report - United Airlines Flight 232 \\n1-4\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\n1.5.6 Anomal\\ny Distribution Curves. \\nThe knowledge gained between 1996 and 2012 has enabled the construction of new \\ndefault hard alpha size and frequency distri butions (anomaly distribution curves). The \\nnew curves provided in appendix C apply to billet materials that have been inspected \\nusing zoned ultrasonic inspection. The new curves benefit from the following: \\n1.Improved assumptions regarding the size  and frequency of hard alpha anomalies\\npresent at the ingot stage.\\n2.An improved understanding of the capabilit y of the titanium billet zoned ultrasonic\\ninspection reflected in the revised probability of detection (POD) curves.\\n1.5.7 Default-Zoned Ultrasonic Inspection POD Curves. \\nThe new default-zoned ultrasonic inspecti on POD curves and the method used to \\ndevelop the POD curves are contained in FAA Report, DOT/FAA/AR-07/63. This \\nreport specifies that the new zoned POD accounts for a “dual reject criteria based on amplitude and signal-to-noise ,” consistent with AMS2628 Class A. The new anomaly \\ndistribution curves do not reflect the improve ments in material cleanliness that have \\noccurred since 1996. The hard alpha find rate, per million pounds, remains unchanged \\nand consistent with the 1996 information provided in AC 33.14-1. The intent is to \\nprovide margin to address other majo r anomaly types found in titanium and \\naccommodate fluctuations in th e annual hard alpha find rate. \\n1.5.8 Default Hard Alpha Size  and Frequency Curves. \\nFuture updates to the default hard alpha si ze and frequency curves should be based on \\nthe updated ingot size distribution (see GT2012- 68987). Future default hard alpha size \\nand frequency curve updates should maintain a margin between the hard alpha find rate \\nused in the development of the curves and the prevailing 5-year moving average. This margin will allow for fluctuations in the annual rate and other major anomaly types \\nfound in titanium. \\n1.5.9 Enhanced Life Management Process. \\nThe Enhanced Life Management Process first introduced in AC 33.14-1 is retained. The probabilistic fracture mechanics assessm ent methodology and calibration test case \\ndescribed in AC 33.14-1 is also  retained and unchanged. It is included in this document \\nfor convenience purposes. \\n1.5.10 Fracture Mechanics-Based Methodology. \\nThe applicant should assess titanium rotor de signs using the fracture mechanics-based \\nmethodology contained in this AC. Anomaly distribution curves should be selected \\nfrom appendix C unless an FAA-approved company-specific curve is available. Anomaly distribution curve selection should be consistent with the production inspection process for the design in question. Designs satisfying the design target risk (DTR) values will be considered compliant with the damage tolerance requirements required by § 33.70 for titanium melt anomaly only. AC 33.70-1 and AC 33.70-2 define other damage tolerance requirements that apply when using this method. \\n1-5\\nAC 33.70-34/17/23 \\n1.5.11 Results of Gained \\nIndustry Experience. \\nIndustry experience resulting from improveme nts in material cleanliness, billet and \\nforging processes ultrasonic inspections, and the publication of AC 33.14-1 has been \\npositive.

CONVENTIONAL (“SAFE-L IFE”) LIFE MANAGEMENT PROCESS \\n2.1 Safe-life Philosophy. \\n2.1.1 The traditional safe-life philo sophy has served the turbine engine industry and flying \\npublic well. It provides a solid foundation, whic h can be enhanced to address the threat \\nfrom anomalies that cannot be eliminated by the best available manufacturing and \\ninspection processes. \\n2.1.2 AC 33.14-1 originally introduced the “Enhan ced Life Management Process” to the \\nconventional life manage ment procedure. This process was designed to expand the safe-\\nlife philosophy, not replace it. \\n2.2 Addition of Damage Tolerance Assessment. \\n2.2.1 In 2007, the FAA added a new requirement, “Damage Tolerance,” with the introduction \\nof section 33.70. \\n2.2.2 The new element, Damage Tolerance Assessment, is designed to minimize the \\noccurrence of uncontained rotor failures du e to material and manufacturing induced \\nanomalies, therefore, improving fl ight safety (see figure 3-1). \\n2-1\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\nC\\nHAPTER 3. ENHANCED LIFE MANAGEMENT PROCESS \\n3.1 Damage Tolerance Assessment for Critical Titanium Rotating Parts. \\nSection 33.70 requires applicants  to perform appropriate damage tolerance assessments \\n(see figure 3-1). Damage tolerance assessments are fracture-mechanics based \\nprobabilistic risk assessments that predict the relative probability of failure (POF) for each part. The predicted POF is compared to an allowable DTR. Designs that satisfy the allowable DTR will be considered compliant with the titanium melt anomaly damage tolerance requirements as set forth in § 33.70. \\n3.2 \\nOptions to Reduce the POF. \\nEngine manufacturers have se veral options available to reduce the POF to meet the \\nallowable DTR. They include, but are not limited to, the following options: \\n•Component redesign.\\n•Material changes.\\n•Material process improvements.\\n•Manufacturing inspection improvements.\\n•In-service inspections.\\n•Life limit reductions.\\nChapter 4 presents an overview of th e methodolog\\ny for conducting the fracture-\\nmechanics based probabilistic  analyses mentioned above. \\n3-1\\nMETHODS AND \\nMATERIAi.. \\nDATA \\nDEV1E.LOPMEN \\nAND VALIDATION \\nTE.STS SAFE \\nLIIFE \\nPREDICT ION \\nLIIFE \\nMANAGEMENT \\nPROCESS DAIMAG,E \\nTOLERANCE \\nASSESSMENT \\nae,.,ieNT A!X>eO \\nTO EXISTING SAFE \\nLIFE PROCE.SS \\nSERVl:CE LIFE \\nAND PRODUCT \\nASSURANCE 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nFigure 3-1.

DAMAGE TOLERANCE ASSESSMENTS \\nA\\npproach. \\nPr\\nobabilistic Damage Tolerance Risk Assessment (PDTRA). \\nAs described in AC 33.7\\n0-1, a PDTRA is an ac ceptable method to assess a part’s ability \\nto tolerate anomalies. The assessment results provide the basis to evaluate the relative \\ndamage tolerance capabilities of candidate part designs. The results also allow the engine manufacturer to balance enhanced reliability and customer impact. \\nThese resul\\nts are compared to the allowable DTR to determine if the design meets the \\nDTR criteria (see paragraph 4.6). \\nWhile the DTR was selected to limit the probability of hard alpha anomaly failures in \\ntitanium rotor parts, its selection was restricted to risk levels that were technologically achievable. The use of probabilistic risk assessment tools and compliance with the DTR is acceptable for undesirable part conditions  that cannot be eliminated by the best \\nmanufacturing and inspection processes ava ilable. Satisfactory compliance with the \\nDTR should not be used to reject or elimin ate manufacturing and inspection techniques \\ncapable of limiting or reducing the number of anomalies. \\nFurther Risk Reduction Actions. \\nThe need to reduce a part’s risk will be based on whether or not the design under \\nconsideration satisfies the desired DTR at both the individual component level and the \\nengine level. If the targets are met, then the design is considered compliant with the damage tolerance requirements, as define d in § 33.70. The manufacturer has several \\noptions available to achieve the re quired DTRs and may conduct quantitative \\nparametric studies to determine the influence of key variables, such as inspection methods and frequency, hardware geometry a nd processing, material selection, and life \\nlimit reduction. \\nThe manufacturer may then make changes to the design or the part’s field management \\nprocedures, or both, to achieve the allowable DTR (see figure 4-1). This approach gives \\nthe engine manufacturer the flexibility to develop an optimal engine design solution consistent with customer re quirements, company policies a nd procedures, and available \\nresources. An example assessment using this  methodology is described in paragraph 4.3 \\nand appendix A. \\nProbabilistic damage tolerance risk assessments are usually performed during the detail \\ndesign phase of the engine component. Paragraph 4.3 defines an assessment methodology applicable to ma terial melt-related induced anomalies. It contains a \\nstandardized list of inputs for conducting thes e assessments and a process for refining \\nthe design to meet the allowable DTR. \\n4-1\\n  \\n \\n \\n----AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\n4.3 \\n4.3.1 \\n4.3.2 \\n4.3.3 \\n4.3.4 \\n4.3.5 Methodology. \\nManufacturers ma\\ny conduct proba bilistic risk assessments using a variety of methods \\nsuch as the Monte Carlo simulation or numerical integration techniques. \\nFigure 4-1 conceptually depicts a melt-related anomaly probabilistic assessment \\nprocess. Standardized inputs and default data are containe d in the appendices of this \\nAC. Applicants should use them to perform the PDTRA. The use of standardized inputs \\nand default information is necessary to ach ieve consistent industry-wide assessment \\nresults, which can then be compared to the allowable DTRs. \\nA list of standardized inputs is provided be low. Default input data is described in \\nparagraphs 4.3.5 and 4.3.6. The use of default da ta in probabilistic as sessments requires \\nno further demonstration of applicability or accuracy. However, if this data is used, the \\nmanufacturer should follow the guidelines accompanying this data to ensure applicability. The use of input data, other than the default information, may require \\nadditional validation to verify a pplicability, adequacy, and accuracy. \\nProbabilistic risk assessments should incorporate the following  inputs as part of a basic \\napproach: \\n•\\n Anomaly distribution.\\n•\\n Inspection POD.\\n•\\n Maintenance exposure rate.\\n•\\n Component stress and volume.\\n•\\n Material properties.\\n•\\n Crack gr\\nowth lives.\\n•Design ser\\nvice life.\\nInput. \\n4.3.5.1 Anomaly Distribution. \\nFor melt-related (hard  alpha) assessments, use  one of the following: \\n•The default an omaly  distributions outlined in paragraph 4.4; or\\n•FAA-approved company-specific data.\\nManufacturers should develop company-specific data with the same \\nprocess used to develop the default a nomaly  distri butions. This process is \\ndescribed in GT2012 68987 and AI AA-97-1068. Manufactur ers should \\nalso treat anomalies  as sharp propa gating cracks from  the first  stress cycle. \\nInspection of titanium billets should comply with FAA Policy ANE 2002 \\n33.15-R0. This policy states in part– \\n4-2\\n \\n  \\n \\n AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\n•“Require the billet UT inspection system output to be electronic c-scan\\ndata, which can be acquired, re tained, stored, and retrieved\\nelectronically.”\\n•“Perform the UT inspection in accordance with SAE Document\\nAMS2628 [Class A], sections 3 and 4,”  using the following sensitivity\\nstandards or an equivalent  FAA accepted procedure.\\nTable 4-1.

Additionall y, they should verify the surface \\nassessm\\nents al so consi der the effects of fluorescent penet r ant i nspection \\n(FPI) and eddy cu rrent inspection (E CI), as applicable. Par agraph 4.5 of \\nthis section contains default PO Ds and instructions on the use of \\nc\\nompany-specific va lue s. \\nMaintenance Exposure Interval. \\nWhen assessing inspe ction benefits, th e exposure interval curv es for the \\nengine, module, or component in question, may b e modeled in the analysis \\nas appropriat\\ne. \\nStress. \\nA part’s operating st ress is a variable t hat has a major i nfluence on crack \\npropagation life. Manufacturers should bas e this input on the most limiting \\noperational principal stresses, as follows: \\n•Subsurface assessments should incorporate the appropriate subsurface\\nand near-surface stress distributions.\\n•Surface assessments should incorporate th e appropriate surface stress\\ndistributions, including the effec ts of stress concentrations.\\nManufacturers should also: \\n4-3\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\n4.3.5.5 \\n4.3.5.6 \\n4.3.5.7 •Use certification or actual usage flight cycles, if known, to establish\\nstress variation during the flight profile.\\n•Consider the influence of major and minor flight cycles since the\\ncyclic damage accumulati\\non can di ffer dramatically between crack\\npropaga\\ntion and crack initiation.\\nNote: The method described in  this AC has been calibrated against \\nindustr y experience with out consider ing th e surface enhancement effects, \\nsuch as shot peening on predicted cr ack propa\\ngation lives. Therefore, it is \\ninappropriate t o include the benefi cial ef fects of such enhancements . \\nVolume. \\nThis variable ( volume) is r e quired to predict the proba bility of ha ving a \\ndefect in a part. The pa rt is divide d into multiple  smaller sub- volumes; \\neach sub-vol\\nume repr esents t he vol ume of material at a specific st re ss \\nlevel. Sub-volumes are required to assess the risk associated with \\nsubsurface anomalies. \\nManufacturers should su\\nb-divide the pa rt’s surface into thin surface \\nvolumes (“onion skin”). Where a non-axisymmetric feature, such as a \\nseries of holes in a disk \\nweb, ha s a localized stress concentr ation, \\nmanufacturers should decide whether it makes a sig nificant contribution to \\nthe probability\\n of failure. This decision should be based on a combination \\nof: \\n•The ma\\nss of material at high stress; and\\n•The size of the anomaly that would cause the part’s failure, prior to\\nreaching i\\nts safe-life.\\nWhile the method described in this AC assumes axisymmetric features, a \\nnon-axisymmetric fe\\nature can  also be included. To do this, reduce the \\ncross-sectional area to ensure that the total volume, when integrated \\naround the whole \\ncircumference, is equal to the volume at high stress. \\nMaterial Data. \\nManufacturers should use the average, cyclic crack growth rate properties \\nof the base mate\\nrial generated in an air environment as the default \\ncondition to calculate anomaly propagation life. \\nPropagation Life. \\nPropagation life is defined as the \\nnumber of cycles for a given size \\nanomaly \\nto grow to a critical size. It is based on all of the following \\nfactors: \\n•Knowledge of part stress,\\n•Temperature,\\n•Geometry,\\n4-4\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\n•Stress gradients,\\n•Anomaly orientation, and\\n•Material properties.\\nManufacturers should use linear elastic fra cture-mechanics for calculating \\npropagation life. De fault conditions shoul d assume anomalies to be in the \\nworst orientation to the stress field. \\n4.3.6 Calibration.\\nEngine manufacturers should conduct the industry test case deta iled in appendix A of \\nthis\\n AC t o cal ibrate t heir analytical predi cti on tools. The test case consists of a \\nprobabilistic analysis of an ideal titanium ring dis k, using speci fied inputs and \\nscenarios. \\nTest case results considered acceptable are in the ranges below: \\n•1.27E-09 to 1.93E-09 (for the “no inspection” case).\\n•8.36E-10 to 1.53E-09 (for the “with in-service inspection” case).\\nTest case results outside  these ra nges may indic a te problems with either the \\npr\\nobabilistic a sse ssment technique or the assumptions. \\n4.3.7 Output.\\n4.3.7.1 Com\\nponent Level Asses\\nsments. \\nManufacturers should calculate th e probabilistic assessments and \\nprediction of event potential over the entire anticipated service life of a \\npart. This result should be expressed as the number of predicted events for \\neach cycle and designated as the predicted “component event rate.” For multiple stage components, such as  spools, manufacturers should conduct \\nthe assessment for each stage. The pr edicted component event rate should \\nthen be compared to the \\ncomponent-level allowable DTR to assess design \\nacceptability. \\n4.3.7.2 Engine Level Assessme\\nnts. \\nWhen all critical titanium rotors in a given engine configuration have satisfied the allowable component level DTR, the cumulative event rate \\nfor these components should then be  calcul\\nated and compared to the \\nallowable engine-level DTR for acceptability. \\n4.3.7.3 All\\nowable Design Target Risks. \\nParagraph 4.6 specifies the al lowable DTRs for titanium. \\n4.3.8 Gener\\nal Comments. \\nStandardized inputs and defau\\nlt data for melt related PDTR A assessments are available \\nfor titanium material, melt-re lated (h\\nard alpha) anomalies. Industry and the FAA are \\ncollaborating to develop the following: \\n4-5\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\n•Material anomaly information for other rotor grade materials (for example, ni ckel).\\n•Inputs and default data for manuf acturing and maintenance-induced anomalies.\\n4.3.9 The FAA strongly \\nencourages engine manuf acturers to incorporate fracture-resistant \\ndesign concepts, when possible. The FAA may give credit for fracture or burst-resistant \\nengine design features that clearly demons trate a reduction in rotor failure due to the \\npresence of melt induced a nomalies from unanticipated ma terial. Manufacturers should \\ndemonstrate the reduction in rotor failure through analysis and test. \\n4.3.10 The design of an aircraft turbine-engine  rotor is a lengthy process involving numerous \\niterations, each of which can substantially alter the initial calcula ted predicted risk. \\nTherefore, it is important that the DTR values be satisfied at the time of engine \\ncertification. \\n4.3.11 Risk assessments may also be conducted several years afte r the engine enters service \\nbecause of changes. These changes could come from design changes associated with in-service problems or changes in the analytical results from evolving predictive capability. \\nNote: The allowable D\\nTRs should be satisfied  at both the individual component and \\noverall engine levels throughout the life of the part. \\n4.4 Anom\\naly Distributions. \\n4.4.1 \\nIngot Distributions. \\nKey inputs associated with PDTRA assessments  are the size and rate of occurrence of \\nthe anomalies. This type of information is statistical and can be presented in a form that plots the number of inclusions  that exceed a particular si ze in a specified amount of \\nmaterial. Anomaly distributions may be referred to as “exceedance curves.” At a high-level, a similar approach was used to develop the distributions in AC 33.14-1 and this \\nAC. However, some of the de tailed assumptions that went into defining the underlying \\ningot distribution were different for this  AC based on updated in formation available \\nsince AC 33.14-1 was issued. Publications AIAA-97-1068 and ASME GT2012-68987 (see paragraph 1.3.3 of this AC for full citati on) provide detailed in formation covering \\nthe development of the ingot distributions and downstream exceedance curves, including how the POD data were used a nd verification against fleet experience. \\nTherefore, although both sets of curves are meaningful for assessing risk from hard alpha in titanium, manufacturers should not us e them in direct comparison to draw \\nconclusions about the billet or forging insp ection techniques, technology, or capability. \\n4.4.2 Titanium Melt-Re lated (Hard Alpha) Distributions. \\nThe hard alpha anomal y distributions contained in appendix C of this AC apply to fully \\nmachined components. The exceedance curves assume that: \\n•The ma\\nterial is triple vacuum arc remelt (3VAR), or cold hearth melt (CHM), plus\\nvacuum arc remelt (VAR) melted material.\\n4-6\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\n•The material has been inspected at the billet and forging stages according to the\\nstandards specified on the curve and are consistent with the POD curves as\\ndescribed in paragraph 1.5.8.\\nFor example, figure C-1 represents the an omaly d istribution for a component produced \\nfrom >10-inch diameter billet an\\nd is: \\n•Inspected at the billet stage usin g a zoned ultrasonic inspection performed  in\\naccordance with AMS2628 Class A.\\n•Calibrated to a #3 flat bottom hole (FBH).\\n•Calibrated at the sonic shape using a conventional (non-zoned) ultrasonic probe\\ncalibrated to at lea st a #3 FBH.\\nManufacturers may use the anomaly distributions contained in appendix C to determine \\ncompliance with the allowable DTR options listed in paragraph 3.2. The background \\nassociated with the development of these distributions is contained in GT2012 68987 \\nand AIAA-97-1068. The distributions were developed by modeling a complex series of \\ninterrelated steps that simulated the entire c omponent manufacturing and inspection \\nprocess, from billet conversion to final part machining. \\nIndividual engine\\n manufacturers who desire to use an alternate anomaly distribution or \\nan improved inspection should use the methodology contained in GT2012 68987 and \\nAIAA-97-1068 to crea\\nte the alternate distributions. Manufactures must substantiate \\nalternate distributions with the app\\nropriate background data. An alternate distribution \\nshould: \\n1.Include three dimensional inclusion data.\\n2.In\\nclude inspection POD data.\\n3.Account for potential undetected, uncracked, and unvoided inclusions.\\n4.Be based upon substantial field experience.\\n4.5 Default Input - POD by No ndestructive Evaluation. \\n4.5.1 Detection of Local Material Anomalies. \\nThe capability of individual nondestructive evaluation (NDE) processes, such as eddy \\ncurrent, penetrant, or ultrasonic inspection, to detect local material anomalies (discontinuities or potential anomalies) is a function of numerous parameters, including the size, shape, orientation, location, and ch emical or metallurgical character of the \\nanomaly. In addition, manufacturers should c onsider the following parameters when \\nassessing the capabilities of an NDE process. \\n1.The material being inspected, such as its composition, grain size, conductivity,\\nsurface texture, etc.\\n4-7\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n 4.5.2 \\n4.6 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\n4.6.1 \\n4.6.2 2.The inspection materials \\nor instrumentation, such as specific penetrant and\\ndeveloper, inspection frequency, instrument bandwidth and linearity, etc.\\n3.The inspection par\\nameters, such as scan index.\\n4.The i\\nnspector, such as visual acuit y, attention span, training, etc.\\nDefault P OD Data. \\nThe “de\\nfault” POD data supplied in appe ndix E are characteristic of inspection \\ncapability that has been measured under ty pical, well-controlled conditions. The FAA is \\nproviding these default POD values to a ssist with the selection of nondestructive \\ninspection techniques that are best suited to support the co mpletion of damage tolerance \\ninspections. Although properly applied inspec tions should result in capability similar to \\nthese default values, they are strictly applic able only under the conditions in which they \\nwere acquired (see appendix E). De fault POD curves are listed below: \\n1.F\\nor a description of default POD curves, see appendix E.\\n2.F\\nor an example of a calibration test case using this data, see appendix A.\\n3.F\\nor NDE applicability of these POD curves, see appendix E.\\nDesign Target Risk. \\nAllowable DTR\\n. \\nThe allowable D\\nTR is a benchm ark risk level selected to improve the overall safety of \\nrotating titanium components that have been designed to the standards specified in this \\nAC. The selected goal is expected to achieve a significant and distinct improvement over the 1990s rotor designs and represents a potential event rate reduction between 3x \\nto 10x. The potential improvement for each OEM part will depend on each engine manufacture’s component design characteristics. \\nAllowable “Component Level DTRs” and “Engine Level DTRs.” \\nAllowable “component level DTRs” and an “engine level DTR” for titanium hard alpha \\nanomalies were established to  provide an event rate reduc tion relative to the baseline \\nperiod presented in SAE report, SP-1270. Th e “component level DTR” corresponds to \\nthe maximum allowable predicted component event rate. The “engine level DTR” corresponds to the maximum allowable (cumulative) component event rate for all critical titanium rotating parts in a given engine. The allowable DTRs were developed based on assessments of representative component configurations using the methodology and inputs described in chapter 5 of this AC. \\nNote: The allowable DTRs apply only to the a nomaly distributions contained within \\nappendix C of this AC. This is primarily due to the selection method of allowable \\nDTRs. Engine manufacturers desiring to use alternate company-specific anomaly distributions will be required to develop alternate allowabl e component and engine level \\n4-8\\n \\n \\n \\n AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\nDTRs. Alternate DTRs c\\nan be shown to provide an event rate reduction consistent with \\nparagraph 4.6.1 using the methodology in GT2012 68987 and AIAA-97-1068. \\n4.6.3 Rotor Titanium \\nLife-Limited Parts. \\nRotor titanium life-limited parts must satisfy the component level DTR and the engine \\nlevel DTR to be considered acceptable. \\n4.6.3.1 \\n4.6.3.2 Application. \\nDefault DTR values have been estab lished fo r melt related (hard alpha) \\nanomalies. Calculated event rates should be assessed against appropriate \\nallowable DTR values.  For multiple stag e components, such as spools, \\neach individual  stage must sat isfy the component  level DTR val ue. \\nAllowable DTR Values for Tita nium M elt Related (Har d Alpha) \\nAnomalies. \\nThe a llowable  DTR values for  titanium melt related (har d alpha) \\nanomalies are as follows: \\n•Component level DTR: 1 x  10-9 events/flight cycle.\\n•Engine  level DTR: 5 x  10-9 events/flig ht cycle.\\n4-9\\n MISSION \\nTIO 1 r, c~,SE I r,o,.e \\nTNI! \\nFLIGHT CYCLE \\nPEAK STRESS \\nCONDITION \\nl \\nPROPAGATION \\nLIFE MAINTENANCE \\nEXPOSURE INTERVAL \\n-,. \\nw ; /~,~--r-/ . ~ \\nCYCLU \\nPROBABILI STIC \\nASSESSMENT ---\\n• l\\'«EDICTED EVENTS INSPECTION POD \\n1,/r}J- ~ .,. \\nA~l:A \\nMATERIAL ANOMALY \\nDISTRIBUTION \\n• !V!NTSIENGII! ,uoHT CYCL! \\nCOMPONENT \\nDESIGN ITERATIONS PART \\nDESIGN LIFE \\nI ::r,-RESULTS \\n- i OS II l l; 0 • • \\' i 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nFigure 4-1.

This section addresses only one face t of that overall process: \\nthe assurance of structural integrity usin g inspection techniques and intervals derived \\nfrom a damage tolerance (fracture-mechanic based) assessment. The inspection philosophy is solely intended to protect agai nst anomalous conditions. It is not intended \\nto allow operation beyond the safe-life limit specified in the airworthiness limitations section (ALS) of the instructions for continued airworthiness (ICA). \\nWhen Risk Levels are Greater than the Desired Target. \\nIn instances where probabilistic assessment indicates risk levels are greater than the \\ndesired target, manufacturers ca n use many strategies to reduce the predicted risk to the \\nallowable level. This discussion only addresses the in-service inspection option. \\nIndustry Data on Uncontained Fracture Experience. \\nIndustry data on uncontained fracture experience was used to guide the development of \\nthe inspection philosophy as summarized in SAE reports AIR1537, AIR4003, and SP-1270. \\nThese reports indicate that the maintenanc e-induced, uncontained failure rates were \\ncomparable to the failure rates for anom alous conditions (material and manufacture). \\nThis data suggests that additional in spection requirements would reduce the \\nuncontained failure rates if properly integrat ed into the normal maintenance scheduled \\nfor the engine. \\nGeneral Inspection Philosophy. \\nThe inspection philosophy presented evolved from the desire to have inspections easily \\nintegrated into the operation of the engine, yet achieve a measurable reduction in \\nuncontained failure rates. \\nAdditionally, it advocates for the use of oppo rtunity inspections rather than forced \\ninspections at “not to exceed” intervals. Opportunity inspections occur due to the “on \\ncondition” maintena nce practices currently used by operators. Although opportunity \\ninspections occur at random intervals, they can be treated statistically and used effectively to lower the calculated risk of an uncontained event. \\nOpportunity Inspections. \\nOpportunity inspection refers to instances wh en the hardware in question is available \\nsuch that technicians can perform the speci fied inspection. This condition is generally \\nviewed as being reduced to the piece part. However, technicians can perform \\nopportunity inspections on assembled modules . For example, a disk bore ECI may be \\n5-1\\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 5.1.6 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\n5.1.7 \\n5.1.8 specified on an assembled module when the modu le is available. This inspection is an \\nopportunity inspection based on module availability rather than piece part availability. \\nForced Inspection Opportunities (by Disassembl y ). \\nThe designs should use opportunity inspecti ons to meet the DTR levels whenever \\npossible . In some insta nces, the pr oba bilistic a nalysis may indic ate un acceptable r isk \\nlevels when using onl y opportunity inspec tions; therefore, additional action may b e \\nrequired to meet the DT R. One  of the ma ny optio ns to mitig ate this risk is to force \\ninspection opportunities by spe cifying disassembly of modules or  engines when a cyclic \\nlife interval has been exceeded. Th ere are many o ptions on how to implement forced \\ndisassembly. The options  range between the following: \\n•Mandatory en\\ngine removal and subsequent teardown at “not to exceed” cyclic\\nlimits (“hard-time”\\n limits) .\\n•Mandatory module teardown when the naturally occurring module availability\\nexceeds the specified cyclic life inspection interval of one of the parts contained\\nwithin that module (“soft-time” limits).\\nThis AC only rec\\nommends the soft-time inspection option when forced disassembly of \\na module is needed to meet the DTR levels. \\n“On-Condition” Maintenance Practice Philosophy. \\nThe soft-time inspection philosophy retains the “on-condition” maintenance practice \\nand minimizes the impact of additional modul e disassembly. The inspection philosophy \\napplies only after the engine ha s been removed from the aircraft for a reason other than \\nthe inspection itself, and the engine is sufficiently disassembled to afford access to the module containing the component in questi on. A module containing a part with cycles \\nsince last inspection (CSLI) in excess of th e soft-time interval should be sufficiently \\ndisassembled to allow inspection according to the procedure specified by the engine manufacturer. The engine manufacturer should evaluate the risk as sociated with parts \\nthat become available for inspection before the soft-time interval to determine if the CSLI can be reset. \\nConsideration of Maintenance Im pact of Soft-Time Intervals. \\nThe maintenance impact of the soft-time intervals should be considered during the design phase. To develop designs that achi eve the design target, but also result in \\nacceptable soft-time intervals and proce dures (should such action be required), \\nmanufacturers should use the following inputs: \\n•\\n Probabilistic ana\\nlysis.\\n•\\n Anticipated e\\nngine removal rate.\\n•\\n Module availability.\\n•Piece part availability.\\n5-2\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 5.1.9 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\n5.1.10 \\n5.2 \\n5.2.1 Interval Limits as Invoked by Soft-Time Inspection. \\nWhen invoked, the soft-time inspection appr oach establishes interval limits beyond \\nwhich rotor components must be insp\\nected wh en the rotors are available in modular \\nform\\n. The sof t-time inspec tion interval is not intended to affect or modif y cur rent \\nforced inspec\\ntion programs, which address the sa fety o f flig ht concerns that arise in the \\ncourse of en\\ngine operation a nd maturation. Manufacturers s hould continue to address \\nsafety of flight concerns throug h aggre ssive inspection programs mandated through \\nairw\\northiness directives. \\nCommunication and Implementation of Inspection  Assumptions. \\nThe inspe ction assumptions made in the pr obabilistic r isk assessment must be \\naccur\\nately i mplement ed and communicated to t he fiel d using t he A L se ction of the ICA. \\nThe assumptions must also be validated b y engine removal rate revie ws, as well as \\nmodule and piece p\\nart availabilit y data. \\nFor example: \\n•The AL section must call out an immersion ultrasonic inspe ction if that was an\\nassumption used to set the original soft-time interval.\\n•The amount of inspected material should correspond to the analysis assumptions. •\\n•If field  experience suggests that the opportunity inspection intervals are in excess of\\nthe assumed rates in the probabilistic risk assessment, then appropriate corrective\\naction is required (for example, modifying the inspection plan).\\nManufacturers will: \\n•Specify the soft-time inspection interval and reference the corresponding inspection\\nprocedures in the AL section of the ICA. This information is to be provided for all\\nrotor parts with specified retirement life- limits that require inspection plans beyond\\nopportunity inspections to meet DTR levels.\\n•Include required inspection information in the AL  section of the ICA with the other\\nrotor inspection requirements.\\n•Provide necessary information to focus the prescribed inspections to  the highest\\nrelative risk areas.\\nInspection Scenario\\ns. \\nThe scenarios in the following\\n subparagraphs clarify the action to ta ke at a maintenance \\ninspection opportunity. Note that the inspection plans may vary for each part, depending on the probabilistic assessment outcomes. \\nMaintenance Opportunity -\\nHardware Av ailable for Opportunity Inspection. \\nFo\\nr hardware available in the condition to perform the specified opportunity inspection, \\nyou must inspect using the procedures specified in the AL section of the ICA.

CALIBRATION TEST CASE \\nA.1 Overview of Self-contained Package. \\nThis appendix provides a self-contained package for the calibration of a probabilistic \\nrisk assessment methodology. The package includes all required input data for the test case, analysis guidelines, and a test case anal ysis section. The test case analysis section \\npermits manufacturers to estimate the level of acceptability of their risk calculations and gain insights on intermediate results. \\nA.2 Test Case Input Data. \\nA.2.1 Anomaly Distribution Curve.\\nThe FAA is providing the anomaly distributions in figure A-11 for this test case. Billet and forging manufacturing inspections are fully accounted for in this curve; no additional modifications are necessary. \\n1.It is assumed that anomalies are sphe rically shaped and uniformly distributed\\nthroughout the part.\\n2.The anomaly distribution should be linearly  extrapolated when anomaly sizes are\\nrequired outside the ra nge of data provided.\\nA.2.2 Probability of Detection.\\nThe POD curve used to determine the effect of an in-service inspection is contained in \\nappendix E of this AC. The default curve to use is the mean POD for ultrasonic inspection of field components with reject i ndications equal to or greater than those \\nfrom a 3/64 inch (1.19 mm) diameter FBH. For the test case, it is assumed that this \\ncurve applies to the whole volume, including the near-surface volume of the component. \\nA.2.3 Maintenance Exposure Interval.\\nAssume that 100 percent of the fleet is u ltrasonically inspected at 10,000 cycles, which \\nrepresents 50 percent of the cer tified part life (20,000 cycles). \\nA.2.4 Incubation.\\nNo anomaly incubation life should be assumed. \\nA.2.5 Stress.\\nThe hoop stress is the limiting ope rational principal stress. \\nA.2.6 Material Data.\\nTwo sets of material  data are provided: \\n1.Physical properties.

It  \\nrepresents generic Ti 6-4 Paris fit data. The FAA is providing this data for \\nexample pur\\nposes only. It does not constitute a recommendation for analyzing  \\nactual components.\\nA.3 Test Case Analysis Guidelines. \\nThe FAA is providing the\\n analytical guidelines for the probabilistic assessments with \\nthe intent to minimize the variations of the applicant’s results due to analytical \\nassumptions. \\nThe practice presented is based on a typical, embedded anomaly probabilistic fracture-\\nmechanics approach. The component is subdivided into zones, the relative risk or probability of failure (POF) is calculated for each zone, and results for each zone are summed statistically to arrive at the total component POF or relative risk. \\nThis analytical approach can be divide d into the following five basic steps: \\n1.Stress analysis.\\n2.Zone definition and volume calculation.\\n3.Crack growth model definition.\\n4.Crack growth calculation.\\n5.\\nZone and total pa rt POF calculation.\\nNote: Para\\ngraph A.4 provides a systematic ex ample for the calibration test case.\\nA-2\\n \\n \\n \\n  AC 33.70-34/17/23 \\nAppendix\\n A \\nA.3.1 General Analytical Guidelines.\\nA.3.1.1\\nA.3.1.2\\nA.3.1.3\\nA.3.1.4Stress Analysis. \\nThe applicant determines the level of mesh refinement of the part model. \\nHowever, applicants should take steps to ensure that the final answer does \\nnot change by a significant amount (5 percent on relative risk or POF) if a \\nfiner mesh is chosen. \\nZone Definition. \\nZones are defined as regions of the component (typically made up of a \\nnumber of finite elements) where life  is approximately constant for a \\ngiven initial crack size. Grouping elements into zones based on stress \\nintervals of 5 ksi (34.5 MPa) is a suggested practice for initial zone definition. Figure A-1 provides a genera l description of the typical types \\nof zones. \\nCrack Growth Calculation. \\nApplicants should base the crack growth-life assumed for each zone on the \\nminimum life location in the zone. This conservative assumption may require that regions of the component that make a significant contribution \\nto the total part POF be broken down into multiple zones. Carry out this subdivision process until you reach convergence of the risk calculation. \\nNote: The method described in this AC  has been calibrated against \\nindustry experience without consider ing the surface enhancement effects, \\nsuch as shot peening, on predicted cr ack propagation lives. Therefore, it is \\ninappropriate to include the beneficial effects of such enhancements. \\nProbability of Failure (POF) and/or Risk Calculation. \\nThe POF of the part is calculated by statistically combining the POF of \\neach zone (surface and subsurface). The POF of each zone can be calculated in either of the following two ways: \\n1.An integrated probabilistic method.\\n2.The “Monte Carlo” method. The number of simulations required is\\nrelated to the computed risk. The general rule is that the number of\\nsimulations should be at least two or ders of magnitude higher than the\\ncomputed risk. For example, if risk is one failure in 104 parts, the\\nnumber of samples required is 106. This ensures that about 100\\n“failed” parts are involved in the assessment.\\nA-3\\n \\n  \\n   \\n  4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix A \\nA.3.2 Specific Guidelines fo\\nr Fracture-Mechanics Modeling, Zone Definition, and Volume\\nCalculations. \\nA.3.2.1 Subsurface Zones. \\nApplicants should: \\n1.Not model surface enhancements for the test case.

The maximum speed is 6,800 RPM, and an external pressure load of 50 \\nMPa (7.25 ksi) is applied on the outer diamet er to simulate blade loading. The disk \\nprobability of failure will be calculated, assuming no in-service inspection and with a single in-service inspection at 10,000 cycles (see figures A-3 and A-4). \\nStep 1 - Component Stress Analysis. \\nComponent stresses are determin ed to perform crack growth analysis, define zones, and \\ncalculate zone volumes. The stress analysis  results are shown below as a component \\nstress contour plot for the maximum principa l stress in each band. Since crack growth \\ncalculations are to be performed, maximum principal (hoop) stresses are used (see \\nfigure A-5). \\nAssumptions: 1.Disk is at a constant temperature.\\n2.No thermal stresses.\\nStep 2 - Stress Volume Calculation. \\nIncremental volumes are used to determine the probability of having an anomaly in a \\nparticular region of the part. The disk is partitioned into zones where within a zone, the residual life is nearly constant. Next, the volume of each zone is calculated. The disk shown in figure A-6 has been partitioned into 36 zones. The FAA provides guidelines for defining the volume of each zone in paragraph A.3. Stress volume results are shown in Table A-2. \\nAssumptions: 1.Stress volumes partitioned at 5 ksi (34.5 MPa) increments are good starting points\\nto perform the risk integration.\\n2.A 0.020 in (0.5 mm) thick onion skin provide s adequate definition of the surface\\nvolume.\\nStep 3 - Crack Growth Model Definition. \\nCrack growth models are constructed for ea ch of the zones defi ned in paragraph A.4.3. \\nExamples for zones 17, 22, and 10 are shown in figure A-7 of this AC. The FAA \\nprovides guidelines for crack growth analysis in figure A-2 of this AC. \\nAssumptions: 1.The crack is positioned in the most life-limiting location within the zone.\\n2.Surface anomalies are modeled as semicircular cracks.\\n3.Surface corner anomalies are modeled as quarter circles.\\n4.Subsurface anomalies are modeled as circular cracks.\\nA-7\\n \\n  \\n  \\n   \\n \\n 4/17/23 \\nA.4.5\\nA.4.6\\nA.4.7\\nA.4.8AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix\\n A \\nStep 4 - Crack Growth Calculations. \\nCrack growth calculations are performed usin g the predicted stresses and crack growth \\nrate data to determine the residual life associated with each zone (figure A-8). The \\ncalculations are conducted for a range of initia l crack sizes to ensure that the component \\nservice life is covered. \\nAssumptions: 1.All anomalies act as sharp propagating cracks and are orientated normal to the\\nmaximum principal stress: hoop stress.\\n2.The crack growth rate curve is the same for both surface and subsurface\\ncalculations.\\n3.Average air crack growth data.\\n4.No surface enhancement effects.\\nStep 5 - Relative Risk Calcul ation - No In-Service Inspection. \\nThe probability of failure for each stress volume is calculated, integrating the volume, \\nanomaly distribution, and residual life information from the previous steps (figure A-9). The results for each zone are statistically  summed to determine the total component \\nprobability of failure. The calculated probability of failure without an in-service inspection is 1.9E-09 events/cycle. \\nStep 6 - Relative Risk Calculations  - With a Single In-Service Inspection. \\nThe “with inspection” probability of failure calculations are performed in the same manner as in paragraph A.4.6, except the ultras onic inspection POD data and cycles to \\ninspection are included in the risk integration (figure A-10). The calculated probability of failure with a mid-life inspection is 1.4E-09 events/cycle. \\nAssumptions: 1.The ultrasonic inspection POD curve is a pplicable for 100 percent of the component\\nvolume (surface connected and subsurface).\\n2.Inspection is performed at 10,000 cycles.\\n3.The anomaly area in the inspection plane is equivalent to the anomaly area in the\\nstress plane.\\nStep 7 – Results. \\nNumerous manufacturers have pe rformed this test case.

SOFT-TIME INSPECTION EXAMPLE \\nB.1 Overview of Soft-time Inspection Example. \\nThis appendix provides an example of an acceptable process to set the opportunity \\ninspection requirements that will be specified in the airworthiness limitations (AL) \\nsection of the instructions for continued airw orthiness (ICA). As discussed in chapter 5, \\nthe application of the opportunity inspecti on is one of several options available to \\nreduce the predicted probability of failure (P OF) in the event that a component design \\ndoes not meet the DTR criteria. \\nChapter 5 introduced the following three scen arios for opportunity inspections to clarify \\nthe actions that technicians could take at a maintenance opportunity. The scenarios are \\nas follows: \\n1.Hardware available for opportunity inspection.\\n2.Module below soft-time interval.\\n3.Module above soft-time interval.\\nB.2Note: The FAA presents ex amples of t he  first a nd third scenarios in this appendix. The \\nsecond scenario could be analyz\\ned in a similar manner to the third scenario. \\nThe key elem ents to determine opportunity  inspec tion requirements, given an y scenario, \\nare as\\n follows: \\n•Type of inspection method and associated  level of sensitivity.\\n•Maintenance interval at  which time the hardware will be exposed for inspection.\\n•Cyclic threshold or soft-time interval  for module exposure at which time the\\ninspections wi\\nll be invoked.\\nGiven each scenario, details of an inspection plan can take many forms. Figure B-1 \\nshows the decision process to select the appropriate inspection requirements. The FAA \\nwill reference this flowchart throughout this section to guide the discussion. \\nExamples of  Scenario 1: Hardware Available for Opportunity Inspection. \\n1.Figure \\nB-1 shows that the predicted POF for the simple ring disk, without the\\nbenefit of in-service inspection, is 1.9 E-09 events/cycle. Therefore, the ring disk\\ndesign does not meet the 1.0 E-09 event/cycle DTR (a “No” answer at block 3). If\\nthe ring disk POF were less than the DTR, the design would be consideredacceptable (block 4), and no in-ser vice inspection would be required.\\n2.Assuming a design change is not possible (for example, stress reduction, material\\nchange, or manufacturing inspection enha ncement), then the decision is made\\n(block 5) to explore the opportunity insp ection option to reduce the component risk\\nbelow the DTR.\\n3.With the decision made to pursue the in spection route, the level of maintenance\\nopportunity is selected for the study. The options available are piece part, module,\\nB-1\\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix B \\neng\\nine, or some combination of these opportunities. The desire is to select an \\nexposure level or combination of levels that minimize the impact on the operator, \\nyet has a high potential to reduce the component  risk level. It is anticipated that the \\napplicant will use trial and error to arrive at the best solution. Working with these \\ndamage tolerance criteria will give the a pplicant experience to make good initial \\nselections, which will reduce the amount of anal ytical effort in future analyses. For \\nthe initial pass, a one-time ultrasonic inspec tion at first piece part exposure (block \\n6)and an inspection threshold of zero cycles (block 7) will be evaluated. Figure B-2\\nshows the piece part, maintenance exposure distribution for the ring disk.\\n4.An ultrasonic inspection that rejects indications equal to or  greater than a #3 FBH is\\nselected. The solid line in figure E-4 is the POD for this inspection (block 8).\\n5.The POF calculations (block 9) are perf ormed in the same manner as in paragraph\\nA.4.7; except, instead of a fixed insp ection at 10,000 cycles, inspections are\\nassumed to occur as the piece parts are exposed. The piece part, exposuredistribution is treated as a random va riable in the probabilistic analysis.\\n6.The calculated probability of failure is 1.3E -9 events/cycle, which is still greater\\nthan the DTR (a “No” answer at block 10). On a second pass, a more sensitive\\nultrasonic inspection is assumed, which reje cts indications equal to or greater than\\none-half the response from a #3 FBH. The dotted line in figure E-5 represents theassociated POD for this inspection. The resulting POF is 9.9E-10 events/cycle,meeting the DTR (a “Yes” answer at block 10).\\n7.The design would be considered acceptable (relative to the damage tolerance\\ncriteria), and the following inspection requi rements would be placed in step 12 of\\nthe AL section of the ICA.\\n•  \\n Inspect at first piece part exposure.\\n•  \\n Ultrasonic inspection calibrated to a #3 FBH.\\n•  Reject indications equal to or greater than one-half the response from a #3 FBH\\ncalibration.\\n•  Include reference to detailed ultrasonic inspection procedures.\\nB.3 Example of Scenario 3: \\nModul e above Soft-Time Interval. \\n1.For this example, piece part exposure of the ring disk is expected to occur at a lower\\nrate than in the previous scenario. Figure B-3 depicts this change.\\n2.The predicted POF is 1.2E-09 events/cycle, assuming this new exposure\\ndistribution and the same UT inspection and sensitivity as in scenario 1. Since the\\npredicted POF exceeds the DTR, additional action is necessary.\\n3.Assuming that it is not reasonable to use a more sensitive field ultrasonic inspection\\n(for example, calibration to a smaller fl at bottom hole), then the module exposure\\ndistribution is evaluated (figure B-4).\\nB-2\\n \\n  \\n \\n 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix B \\n4.The resulting\\n predicted POF is 8.3E-10 even ts/cycle, clearing the DTR with margin.\\nHowever, specifying an ultrasonic in spection of the ring disk upon module\\nexposure requires removal of the disk from the module, increasing the burden on\\nthe operator. Since there is margin between the predicted POF and the DTR,consider another inspection plan to alle viate some of the burdens of forcing\\nmodules to piece part level. This appr oach implements the soft- time, inspection\\ninterval scenario. Instead of going to th e module exposure, the inspections would be\\nperformed at piece part exposure, at a specified cyclic interval, and then change toinspections at module exposure. The cyclic  interval, before imposing an inspection\\nbased on module exposure, is the soft-time inspection interval.\\n5.Thi\\ns strategy essentially accelerates the piece part exposure rate, as shown in figure\\nB-5. By iterating on the length of the soft-time interval, a 12,300 cycle value isfound to yield a POF of 1.0E-09 events for each cycle, satisfying the DTR criteria.The design would be considered acceptable, relative to the damage tolerancecriteria, and the following inspection requirements would be placed in step 12 of theAL section of the ICA.\\n•  \\n Inspect at first piece part exposure.\\n•  For parts not previously inspected befo re 12,300 cycles, inspect at first module\\nexposure above 12,300 cycles, soft -time inspection interval.\\n•  \\n Ultrasonic inspection calibrated to a #3 FBH.\\n•  Reject indications equal to or greater than one-half the response from a #3 FBH\\ncalibration.\\n•  \\n Include reference to detailed ultrasonic inspection procedures.\\n6.The information contained in this sec tion is provided for ex\\nample purposes only.\\nEach individual component design and en gine maintenance practice may require\\ndifferent solutions than those presented here. The AL section of the ICA\\nrequirements should reflect acti ons consistent with the analytical assumptions made\\nto meet the DTR criteria.\\nB-3\\n 1 2 3 4 \\nCANDIDATE ~ ASSESS _____.

DEFAULT ANOMALY DISTRIBUTION CURVES \\nC.1 Use of Anomaly Distribution Curves. \\nThe anomaly distribution curves associated with hard alpha inclusions in titanium \\nengine rotors are shown in figures C-1 through C-6. The following text provides additional information associated with using these distributions. \\n1.The distributions apply only to hard alpha inclusions in rotor grade (premium)titanium, melted using triple VAR or CHM plus VAR processes.\\n2.It is crucial to use the appropriate distribution curve that accurately reflects the\\ninspection sensitivities performed at the billet and forging stages of themanufacturing process. The distributions in this appendix are applicable to\\ncomponents that were inspected at th e billet stage using a zoned, ultrasonic\\ninspection performed in accordance with the ultrasonic titani um billet inspection\\npolicy found in the FAA’s Policy Memo ANE 2002-33.15-R0.\\n3.For example, the material must be inspect ed using ultrasonic inspection to at least a\\n#3 FBH with the reject level set at one-half that of the calibration level (foradditional instructions, see appendix E). T echnicians must perform inspections at\\nboth the billet and sonic shape stages.\\n4.The distribution accounts for all steps required to manufacture a finished part,\\nincluding the in-process billet and sonic shape, forging ultrasonic inspections.Therefore, the distribution used should reflect the inspection sensitivities used in thebillet and forging inspections  and should not be altered.\\nC.2 Critical Elements of Anom aly Distribution Curves. \\nApplicants and technicians should consider the following elements when referring to \\nfigures C-1 through C-6: \\n1.The vertical axis represents the expected number of hard alpha inclusions for each\\nmillion-pounds of titanium. This information should be treated as the probability of\\nhaving an inclusion of a given size or larger (exceedance probability).\\n2.The horizontal axis is the inclusion cross-sectional area, including the hard alpha\\ncore and the surrounding diffusion zone. Technicians should assume a circular\\ninclusion cross-section with the corresponding  diameter used as the initial size in\\nthe crack growth analysis.\\n3.Default curves, listed in Table C-1, are available to demonstrate compliance with\\n§ 33.70.\\nC-\\n1\\n \\n \\n \\n 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix C \\nT\\nable C-1.

DEFAULT PROBABILIT Y OF DETECTION APPLICABILITY \\nD.1 Use of Accepted Estimates of the Probability of Detection. \\nD.1.1 This appendix defines conditi ons relevant to the use of ac cepted estimates of the POD.\\nThese estimates are for specific types of anomalies and specific nondestructive \\nevaluations or inspection techniques. Applicants may consider these estimates as default \\nvalues when applied under appropriately s imilar conditions. The conditions defined in \\nthis appendix do not necessarily guarantee the validity of these POD values. For example, if inspection parameters such as penetrant concentration or temperature are \\ninadequately controlled, the penetrant capab ility shown in the accompanying graph will \\nnot be reached even if the correct penetr ant is selected. The FAA recommends using a \\nwritten plan for controlling and monitoring inspection processes, as described in paragraph D.3. \\nD.1.2 If the conditions described for each inspection are not satisfied, the resulting inspectioncapability and reliability will be reduced. Accordingly, the use of default POD values would then be inappropriate and would result in an overly optimistic damage tolerance assessment. \\nD.2 Demonstrations of Inspection Capability. \\nFor eddy current inspections (ECIs) and ultrasonic inspections, alternative default POD \\ncurves are given. Choose the appropriate P OD curve based on demonstration that the \\nstated calibration and reject  signal levels are attain able on the component being \\ninspected. Ensure that noise and geometrica l features do not prevent appropriate POD \\nselection. The demonstration conditions should be appropriate to th e properties of the \\npart inspected that may affect the inspecti on ability, such as surface conditions, depth to \\nbe inspected, proximity to edges, etc. No other demonstration of these default capabilities is necessary, as long as the requirements for the specific inspection \\ntechnique are satisfied (see para graphs D.3, D.4, D.5, and D.6). \\nD.3 Restrictions and Applicability. \\nD.3.1 Inspection Process C ontrol and Performance.\\nThe inspection process must be thoroughly controlled and performed in accordance \\nwith acceptable procedures, as defined by the engine standard practices manual. The inspection process must also be consistent with good industr ial inspection practices, like \\nthose defined by military or industry standards. \\nD.3.2 Inspection Process Parame ters, Plans, and Fixtures.\\nWritten procedures should govern pertinent inspection process parameters, such as \\ncoverage, probe indexing, and scanning sp eeds. Inspection plans and applicable \\ninspection fixtures should be designed to minimize human and other sources of variability. \\nD-1\\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix\\n D \\nD.3.3 \\nInspector Qualifications.\\nInspectors must be qualified and trai ned according to ASNT-TC-1A, ATA-105, or \\nequivalent, and have ade quate training in the specific inspection method. \\nD.3.4 Data Limitations.\\nThe default POD data presented in this AC apply only to titanium alloys used for engine \\ndisks and inspected material. Geometrical conditions, such as radii and edges, can \\ncreate areas where inspections cannot be ac complished. Limitations re lative to the depth \\nof penetration and near-surfa ce resolution also exist. Conditions under which the default \\nPOD data were acquired are outlined  in paragraphs D.4, D.5, and D.6. \\nNote: Manufacturers should seek advice about the equivalence of alternative conditions \\nfrom those with expertise in nondestruc tive evaluation (NDE). Areas of high \\ncompressive, residual stress can have negative effects on the capability of various NDE techniques, most notably penetrant inspection. \\nD.3.5 Applicability of Default POD Data.\\nApplicability of the default POD data is  limited to components exhibiting no abnormal \\nsurface conditions, and have been pr operly cleaned per each shop manual’s \\nrequirements. No other special pre-inspec tion cleaning or polishing is required. \\nD.4 Restrictions and Appl icability: Eddy Curren t Inspection (ECI). \\nD.4.1 Overview of ECI.\\nECI is an inspection technique suitable for de tecting surface or near-surface anomalies. \\nFor purposes of this AC, it is primarily intended for application to engine-run \\ncomponents. The default POD data were acquired under the following conditions: \\n1.Probes containing absolute coils with in spection frequency in the 2-6 MHz range.\\n2.Probe fixtures capable of following surface contours on the component being\\ninspected with adequate control of attitude, lift-off, and scan indexing. The scan\\ndirection was parallel with an y uniform feature changes.\\n3.Provision was made for au tomatic recording of inspection process signals or\\nautomated alarm, or both, when the inspection threshold was exceeded.\\nD.4.2 Selection of Appropriate POD Curve.\\nThe default POD data apply to surface-connect ed, low-cycle, fatigue cracks. Note the \\nfollowing criteria: \\n1.Cracks are assumed to have a 2:1 aspect ratio (length:depth).\\n2.Crack sizes are expressed in term s of the length at the surface.\\n3.Cracks must not be obscured by oxide, contaminants, etc.\\n4.Inspected surfaces should be flat or only moderately curved.\\nD-2\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n D.64/17/23 \\nD.5\\nD.5.1\\nD.5.2\\nD.6.1AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix\\n D \\nChoosing the approp\\nriate POD curve from those provided must be based on component \\ndemonstration of the attainable inspection sensitivity (see paragraph D.2). \\nRestrictions and Applicability: Penetrant Inspection. \\nOverview of Penetrant Inspection. \\nPenetrant inspection is an in spection technique suitable for detecting anomalies that are \\nopen to the inspected surface. For the purposes of this AC, it is primarily intended for \\napplication to engine-run components. The default POD data were acquired under the following conditions: \\n1.Fluorescent penetrants qualified as le vel 4 by SAE AMS2644, or equivalent, and\\nused with dry powder developer, as a minimum.\\n2.Application of penetrant and developer was automated for each standard practice\\n(see ASTM E 1417 and SAE AMS2647).\\n3.Manipulation of the part was possible to present to the inspector an unrestricted\\nview of the surface to be inspected.\\nSelection of Appropriate POD Curve. \\nThe default POD data apply to surface-connect ed, low-cycle, fatigue cracks. Note the \\nfollowing: 1.Cracks are assumed to have a 2:1 aspect ratio (length:depth).\\n2.Crack sizes are expressed in term s of the length at the surface.\\n3.Cracks must not be hidden by oxide, contaminants, etc.\\n4.Inspected surfaces should be readily visible.\\nChoosing the appropriate POD curve from those provided must be based on whether \\nfocused or full-field inspection conditions a pply, see figure E-1 and appendix F. \\nRestrictions and Applicability: Ultrasonic Inspection. \\nOverview of Ultrasonic Inspection. \\nUltrasonic inspection is an inspection tec hnique suitable for detecting subsurface \\nanomalies. For purposes of this AC, it is intended for application to billet and engine-\\nrun components. The default POD data we re acquired under the following conditions: \\n1.5 MHz inspection frequency.\\n2.Water immersion, inspection conditions.\\n3.Normal incidence, longitudinal, wave m ode for inspection of billet using single 0.5-\\ninch x 1.0-inch cylindrically focused transducer.\\n4.Shear wave mode for inspection of fi nish-machined components using 0.75-inch\\ndiameter, spherically focused transducer.\\nD-3\\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix\\n D \\n5.Transduce\\nr (search unit) fixture was capab le of following surface contours of the\\ncomponent being inspected with adequate control of attitude and scan indexing.\\n6.Provision was made for \\nautomatic recording of the in spection process signals or\\nautomated alarm, or both, when the inspection threshold was exceeded.\\nD.6.2 Selection of Appropriat\\ne POD Curve.\\nFor ultrasonic inspection, the default POD data apply to mixtures of anomalies typical \\nof those that may be found in billet or engine-run material, as appropriate. These anomalies include, for example: \\n•  \\n Hard alpha associated voids or cracks.\\n•  \\n Strain induced porosity.\\nNote the following obser\\nvations:\\n1.Other anomaly types may occur, such as high-density inclusions, but these are not\\nincluded in the current analysis.\\n2.Anomaly sizes are expressed in term s of maximum cross-sectional area\\nperpendicular to the sound beam, incl uding associated diffusion zones where\\nappropriate.\\n3.Inspected finish-machined surfaces shoul d be flat or only moderately curved.\\n4.Billets should be circular-cylindrical and in customary pre-inspection conditions\\n(turned, ground, or peeled).\\nChoosing the appropriate POD curve from those provided must be based on component \\ndemonstration of the attainable inspection sensitivity (see paragraph D.2). Making provisions to maintain this sensitivity at all depths and effective distance amplitude compensation is required. \\nD-4\\n4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix E \\nAPPENDIX E.

DEFINITIONS \\nThese definitions are for the purpose of this AC only. \\n•Component Event Rate. The number of events for a given titanium rotor component stage \\nfor each flight cycle, calculated over the projected life of the component.\\n•Dama ge Tolerance. An element of the life management process that recognizes the potential  \\nexistence of component imperfections. The potential existence of component imperfections is \\nthe result of inherent material str\\nucture, material processing, component design, \\nmanufacturing,\\n or usage. Damage toler ance addresses this situation through the incorporation  \\nof fracture resistant design, fracture-mechanics, process control, or non destructive inspection.\\n•Default Probability of Detection (POD) Values. Values representing mean probabilities of  \\ndetecting anomalies of various types and sizes under specified inspection conditions consistent \\nwith good industry practi ce.\\n•Design Target Risk (DTR) Value. The standard against which probabilistic assessment  \\nresults, stated in terms of\\n component event rates and engine-level event rates, as defined  \\nabove, are compared.\\n•Di rected Inspection. Inspections where specialized  processing instructions have been  \\nprovided and the inspector has been instructed to pay attention to specific critical f eatures.\\n•Event A rotor structural part separation, failure, or burst with no regard to the consequence.\\n•Full-Field Inspection. The general inspection of  a component without special attention to any \\nspecific features.\\n•Hard Alpha. An interstitially  stabilized  alpha phase region of substa ntially  higher hardness  \\nthan the surrounding material. This comes from very high local nitrogen, ox ygen, or carbon \\nconcentrations that increase the beta transus and produce the high hardness, often brittle,  \\nalpha  phase. A high interstitial defect  is also commonly  called a Type I def ect, low-density  \\ninclusion (LDI), or a hard  alpha ofte n asso ciated with voids and cracks.\\n•Inspected Material. The portion of the total volume of a component that is actually inspected \\nunder the described conditions. Inspected material does not guarantee anomaly free  material.\\n•Inspection Opportunity. An occasion when an engine is disassembled to at least the  modular \\nlevel and the hardware in question is accessible for inspection, whether or not the hardware \\nhas been reduced to the piece part level.\\nF-1\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n 4/17/23 AC 33.70-3 \\nAppendix\\n F \\n•  Maintenance Exposure Interval . Distribution of shop visits (in-flight cycles), new or last\\noverhaul, since an engine, module, or component is exposed to as a function of normal\\nmaintenance activity.\\n•  Mean POD . The 50 percent confidence level POD versus anomaly size curve.\\n•  Module . A combination of assemblies, subassemblies,  and parts contained in one package, or\\narranged to be installed in one maintenance action.\\n•  Probabilistic (Relative Risk) Assessment . A fracture-mechanics based simulation\\nprocedure that uses statistical techniques to mathematically model and quantitativelycombine the influence of two or more variables to estimate a most likely outcome or range ofoutcomes for a product. Since not all variables may be considered or may not be capable of\\nbeing accurately quantified, the numerical predictions are used on a comparative basis toevaluate various options having the same level of inputs. Results from these analyses aretypically used for design optimization to meet a predefined target, or to conduct parametricstudies. This type of procedure is distinctly different from an absolute risk analysis, which\\nattempts to consider all significant variables and is used to quantify, on an absolute basis, thepredicted number of future events having safety and reliability ramifications.\\n•Probability of Detection (POD). A quantitative statistical measure  of de tecting  a particular\\ntype of anomaly over a range of sizes using a specific nondestructive inspection techniqueunder specific conditions. Typically, the mean POD curve is used.\\n•Safe-Life. An LCF-based process where components are designed and substantiated to have\\na specified service life, stated in operating cycles, operating hours, or both. Continued safe\\noperation up to the stated life-limit is not contin gent on each unit of a given design receiving\\ninterim inspections. When a component reach es its published life-limit, it is retired from\\nservice.\\n•Soft-Time Inspection  Interval. The number of fligh t cycles since new, or the most  recent\\ninspection, after which a rotor or engine part  in an available module must receive the\\ninspection specified in the AL section of the ICA.\\n•Stage . The rotor structure that supp orts and is attached to a single aerodynamic blade row.\\nF-2\\nOMB Control Number: 2120-0 746 \\nExpiration Date: 11/30/2024 \\nAdvisory  Circular Feedback Form  \\nPaperwork Reduction  Act Burden Statement:  A federal agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not  \\nrequired to respond to, nor shall a person be subject to a penalty for failure to comply with a collection of information   \\nsubject to the requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act unless that collection of information displays a currently valid \\nOMB Control Number.
